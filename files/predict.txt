7,i watched this because i thought there were going to be a lot of car chases and cool cars to gawk at guess i was lied to this movie is very boringbr br the movie starts out kip rainesgiovanni ribisi sitting outside a porsche dealership checking to see if they have the right car when they confirm its the right one kip gets a brick out of the trunk and chucks it at the window shattering it he gets the porsche while his friend gets the keys they start up the car and take off into the night they deliver it to a warehouse only to have been followed by the police so the whole crew ditches all the cars and go their separate ways then we get a glimpse of memphis raines he is giving a little speech to a bunch of kids at a gokart track then he is confronted by atlee jacksonwill patton atlee tells memphis that his brother kip is in deep bleep memphis is known as one of the most notorious car thieves in los angeles memphis heads to a junkyard and meets raymond calitrichristopher ecclesten this guy threatens to kill kip if memphis doesnt deliver 50 cars within 72 hoursbr br there are a few problems with this film br br 1story the first 48 inmovie hours take place when cage and duvall are looking for a crew and planning everything out the last 12 inmovie hours are a waste br br the cars you see maybe 10 cars out of the 50 as the movie advertises so where are the other 40 cars why dont we get to see them br br the chase the chase at the end of the movie was a joke it was not suspenseful at allbr br the dog somewhere in the movie the dog eats the burgers and swallows three keys as well this is impossible the keys were flipped open the keys would have severely damaged the dogs esophagus stomach and large intestines the guys suggest giving the dog laxatives to help him poop it out this wont work the dog will get a lot of diarrhea but no keys it was stated in jackass after ryan dunne stuck a toy car up his rectum take laxatives lots of diarrhea but no car same case with the dogbr br the cop during the chase when eleanor breaks down for a few minutes nicholas cage tries desperately to start up the car you see a police cruiser behind him who isnt looking at his car at all but right when nicholas cage starts the engine up again the police officer jerks his head to the right sees the car and immediately begins to chase after him it is stupid so right when he heard the engine start and saw the car he knew that was the car he was looking for how does he know its the right car he only sees the back of itbr br overall the movie is boring there is no action there are very few cars the movie is stupid i have never seen the original but i plan tobr br i give this movie star out of 10 get the fast and furious instead
1,ive long wanted to see this film being a fan of both peter cushing and david mccallum i agree that the romantic subplot was a waste of time but the talent of mccallum shines through this juvie role thank heavens for turner classic which aired the show last week i can imagine that there were lots of problems with children after the war especially with the way things were throughout the 1950s some of the boys are a bit scary i certainly wouldnt want to met them on a welllit street much less a dark one there were some good insights regarding the feelings of a firebug as well or as they call him a firefly
3,surprisingly not terrible and well animated for one of disneys straight to video throw away sequels like the previous sequel the lion king i was glad that disney brought back most of the original voice actors which makes a big difference and they kept a good level of traditional animation the plot wanders around for a while but we are distracted by an unending string of jokes ranging from hilarious to dull to break up the detached plot and jokes they gave us some silly musical sequences which much like the jokes range from entertaining to a quick trip to the fridge for the most part the mst3klike moments are bland and full of untapped potential and really dont add a whole lot to the movie other than to act as a vehicle for an hourlong flashback the new characters are at least likable and the old characters are out doing their thing so i cant fault them there overall this movie in not bad and it makes for a nice frivolous filler between the more serious lion king titles
7,so i had heard from a few people that this film had brought them to tears in the theater as i watched it for the first time i was expecting another romantic tearjerking barbra streisand film something like the way we were i was certainly wrong the chemistry between the two main characters esther hoffman and her john howard was nonexistent making it impossible to get attached to the characters there wasnt anything romantic about it streisands character fell for an alcoholic drug addict who couldnt sing a single note without making me want to hit the fastforward button at one point her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later theres nothing romantic about a deadbeat rock star and a woman who cant seem to realize it until he actually dies parts of the movie seemed to drag on and on and i kept asking myself when it was going to endbr br the death of john howard was completely predictable there was totally obvious foreshadowing of his reckless behavior early on in the movie and when he died i felt no emotion whatsoever it wasnt a tragic accident it was him basically being an idiot not to mention throughout the movie i was distracted by his hideous beardbr br the only parts of this movie worth seeing are the streisand songs the ending of the movie when she sings with one more look at youwatch closely now was my reason for giving this film a whopping 310 those minutes were the only part of the movie i actually felt an emotion other than irritation and anger
7,before sunrise is romance for the slacker generation richard linklaters romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people the film depicts romance in all its glory but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship thats as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to  with just one problem the problem of time while most relationships wind down with time this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out before sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental hollywood romance which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders the story follows two people jesse an american and celine a french girl that meet on a train into vienna they instantly connect and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train jesse asks celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of viennabr br before sunrise works principally for two reasons  realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life this allows the characters to be free and its easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script this also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are and not merely because theyre the protagonists this kind of realism is hard to capture as at the end of the day we as the audience know that theyre watching a film and not observing real life but before sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen a truly great script cannot work on its own and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice and although im not a fan of either julie deply or ethan hawke on viewing this film there is nothing you can do but give them both respect i dont know whether they were in character or just playing themselves but when a film is this good it hardly mattersbr br in a film like this it is the writing thats the most important thing and contained within the script are several observations about life most of which i personally could relate to this represents what richard linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters but it also manages to expose what true love is along with several other aspects of life the fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing everyone is different and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people there could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates and thats the case with the musings in this script adding to the beauty of the film is the city of vienna the city itself isnt really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere  but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the locationbr br before sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating richard linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental before sunrise is what it is and what it is is pure cinematic brilliance
2,tony goldwyn is a good actor who evidently is trying his hand at directing a walk on the moon appears to have borrowed from other better made films the present story takes place in the late sixties at a summer resort for working class jews not far from woodstock the screen treatment by pamela gray doesnt have much going for it so its a puzzle why mr goldwyn decided to tackle this film as his first attempt at directionbr br the kantrowitz family is spending some time at the resort we see them arrive at the small bungalow that is going to be their temporary home marty the father comes only for the weekend he works in what appears to be a family small appliance business repairing television sets mostly in a few days the first man will walk in space so the excitement is evidentbr br the kantrowitz women are left behind pearl martys wife and her motherinlaw lilian spend idle days in the place until the blouse salesman arrives pearl goes browsing and she finds much more than a shmatte she gets the salesman as well it appears that pearl and marty have no sexual life at all after two children pearl who appears to be sexy and with a high libido is ready for some extra marital funbr br that is the basic premise for the film which becomes a soap opera when the young daughter alison decides to play hooky and go to the woodstock festival nearby where horror of horrors she witnesses her own mom making out with the blouse salesman whats a girl to do well stay tuned for the grand finale when all the parties are happily reunited by the little sons bedside when he is stung by wasps and the salesman comes to apply some home remedy and daddy is called from the city after knowing about pearls betrayal with the younger studbr br poor diane lane she went to make unfaithful later on which is the upscale version of this dud viggo mortensen is the salesman who caters to his lonely female customers whispering little somethings in their ears liev schreiber as marty the cuckolded husband doesnt have much to do anna paquin plays the rebellious alison and tovah feldshuh is the unhappy nana who would like to have stayed in the city watching her soap operas instead of witnessing first hand one that is playing in her own backyardbr br watch it at your risk or pop the dvd in the telly when you have a fun crowd at home and you really want to have a laugh or two dishing the film
1,pros nothingbr br cons everythingbr br plot summary a female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombiesbr br review never in my life have i come across a movie as bad the zombie chronicles filmed on a budget of what looks to be about 20 bucks tzc is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame forgetable actors whom couldnt act to save their lives and gore thats more gross than frightening how does a movie like this even get made simply put avoid tzc like a sexuallytransmitted diseasebr br my last cents humorously enough this movie was made by a movie company called brain damage films theyre brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like thisbr br my rating out of 10if it were up to me this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion
5,i found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting i never had to read this book thankfully or it would have been a painful experience i got the tickets to the preview for free but it still wasnt worth my time or my friends i think this story is not worth telling its like saying that old people have a past before they got old no kidding the lives of the main characters were painful to watch one generation no better than the next at avoiding stupid mistakes however i think the actors did the best they could with a lame story ive always been a big fan of ellen burstyn im writing this review to counteract the positive reviews given which unfortunately convinced me to give this movie a try
5,i remember that i was a child when i first saw this movie it was my first horror movie maybe thats the reason why i can still remember some parts of it i dont remember much about acting nude scenes or other things but i do remember a male has head blown up with a grenade a male dismembered over a tree and a male run down by truck and shot in head  todd schaefer kenny johnson and kevin mcparland i also remember the last scene when jennifer mcallister riped of the killer stomach to get the keys of the truck its a movie that gives you the creep and its worth a look but where do i find it how can i download it
0,heres an indie film i really wanted to like but ultimately could not the lack of script boldly proclaimed in the main titles really shows through and kills the picture the story is a nonsensical mess that isnt worth trying to figure out i quickly became bored within 10 minutes then suffered through the remainder of the first 40 minuteshoping for the bestbefore hitting the chapter stops to mercifully get to the end even that wasnt worth the extra effort ozark savage clearly tries too hard to be clever lifting its best sequences from evil dead and the matrix as a result theres very little in ozark savage that hasnt been done before and better this film would have been much more fun as a 1020 minute short but as a feature it just feels padded and forced of course theres no money in shorts so i completely understand the financial reasons that i assume motivated it being stretched out to 75 minutes director matt steinauer shows great promise and i wish him luck
2,unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that theres nothing to spoil about that movieeven if b mattei had never done any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and craziness that made him a fun eurotrash director but for the last 10 years he seemed to have lost itthis film is just empty nothing at all to wake us up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first 10 minno sex no bloodits suppose to be about snuffno actors no dialogs just as bad as an 90tv filmits even worse than his last cannibals and zombies epicsso rest in peace bruno you will stay in our minds forever anyway thanks to such unforgettable gems aszombi robowarrats laltro infernovirus cruel jaws and few othersso except if you want to see b mattei possessed by jess francos spirits new film pass on this onebut if you dont know this nice artisans career track down his old films and have fun
1,german nut case jrg buttgereit apparently has fans  but i dont know why and im definitely not one of them the only buttgereit film id seen previously was nekromantik and i hated every minute of it but  shockingly  this film is worse der todesking is pointless in the same way as nekromantik but its a worse film because its boring in a way that few movies have ever managed its not far off the blair witch project seriously some people say that this film is sick and shocking but it really isnt the director may have been making a point about death but only he knows what it is how anyone could watch this film and be anything other than bored with it is completely beyond me the film revolves around the theme of suicide and follows the deaths of seven different people over the course of a week yes that means we have a pointless and boring episode for monday a pointless and boring episode for tuesday a pointless and boring episode for wednesday etc etc this film manages to be even more boring than my average week br br der todesking is apparently an art film although this would appear to be a reference to the way that not very much makes sense rather than a reference to the film bearing any resemblance to art each segment of the film is meant to tell a separate story  but it doesnt we just get a quick little sketch on suicide and it only makes you wonder what the point is the film feels like it should be deep but theres a great big void where the intelligence should be and nothing there to fill it buttgereit uses a few evocative images but im unlikely to remember any of them for more than a week or so because this film just isnt that memorable theres a shot involving a decomposing mans body that features fairly often but that gets old pretty quick and all youre left with is the rest of the film which is unfortunate if i were to struggle for good things to say about this crap all i can think of is this the title sounds cool as i mentioned nekromantik is the only other film ive seen from this amateur director i have copies of schramm and nekromantik and now im really in no rush to watch either der todesking is a dull film with no point and anyone that calls it art is very much mistaken give it a miss
0,this was no trainspotting or guy ritchie film it was a big wannabee it wanted to be an edgy nervouslaughter urbanlife affirming film but its more of a camera jerky mess its a lot easier to imitate something else than to create a real story with real characters from the beginning i couldnt care less about the characters or what they were involved in they were always always hitting pissing or crying on each other only there wasnt any substance to what they were doing the dialog between characters is meant to be hip revealing instead it comes out trite and one scene after another is predictable i know there are viewers out there that really liked this movie so i could be wrong
0,quentin crisp once stated that when things are shown too beautifully one is a romantic when things are show unbearably grim they are realistic and when something gets the ironic treatment theyre spot on unfortunately for leon de aranoa he falls into the second catagory this director has obviously tried too hard to make a spanish ken loach type movie without being able to capture the comedy and warmth between the characters that elevate loach movies from merely being depressing los lunes al sol is just that only depressing things are unrealistically grim the characters ultimate moments of misery all reach a climax at the same point and if the glum story isnt enough aranoa washes the tale over with a visually grey and grimy colour palette the films was ridiculously overrated at the goyas a movie that shows empathy for the weaker citizens in society in this case unemployed harbour workers does not automatically make for a good movie even though i would be the first to sympathize with the fates of these people this movie only manages to make me grow disinterested in their fate in 21st century spain unemployed people do not live like beggars and the public transport ferries have decent restrooms and its hard to come across a bar with so few punters and such little happiness to be encountered in it leon de aranoa obviously doesnt have a clue about working class spain and does it no favours pretentious is the only conclusion i can draw the scene where the men watch a football match for free has been directly copied from a film which deals much more realistically with the subject of the poverty trap namely purely belter which is afar more engaging humorous and yet sad
1,yes ill say before i start commenting this movie is incredibly underratedbr br sharon stone is great in her role of catherine trammell as is morrissey as dr glass he is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star glass is drawn into a seductive game that trammel uses to manipulate his mindbr br the acting was good apart from thewlisbr br stone really has a talent with this role shes slick naughty and seductive and doesnt look a day older than she did in the firstshe really impressed melike in casino morrisey was also good he showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it thewlis however was lame he ruined his character and was overthetop the whole way he really suckedbr br overall this movie not as good the first but stone is a hoot to watch just ignore thewlis
3,i remembered the title so well to me it was a flora robson movie with olivier and vivien leigh in supporting roles and it had vincent masseys voice from behind whiskers well flora robson was great her next signature for me would be 55 days at peking the same role but with different sumptuous gowns and the same voice as for the armada it was a subtext i like blackandwhite films was everything done in elizbethan times at night it was talky and difficult to fathom at times i couldnt tell which was the love interest was it the spaniard or was it vivien leigh and i do not believe that elizabeth i would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend that fire ships be sent against the armada apparently it worked for the empire but not for the script this might have been more accurate historically but bette davis had more engaging scripts and i missed daylight
0,i have seen this wonderful production and i wonder if anyone can tell me anything about the actress who played the blacksmiths wifei am not sure of her characters name i went to byu with her and lost touch with herher maiden name was kim lukeand i wonder if anyone has any info on her she is not listed in the credits this production was outstanding a tearjerker on all accounts superb acting by all i guess i dont even want to put it in the general category of acting more like portraying with feeling the amazing events that led to the opening of the heavens for this the final dispensationsomething like that if anyone worked with kim or has a website or something please let me know she was fantastic in her role by the waythanks melissa thorne
7,the dvd for danaza macabra castle of blood is very odd thats because parts of the film are in french with subtitles and the rest is dubbed into english from the french sometimes characters switched between the two in the middle of a scene when i tried to get the film to be just subtitled or just dubbed it made no difference odd but still watchablebr br the story purports to be based on a poe story though i cant recall which one in fact the character of poe appears in the beginning and end of the filmthough it didnt look especially like himbr br a rich man makes a bet with a guy down on his luck that he cannot stay the entire night in a manner home it seems like an easy bet to wineven if the house is very creepy however it cant be that easy as the rich guy says that all those who previously took the bet diedyet this fool still wants to make the wager while in the home he meets lovely barbara steele within and falls madly for her later however he learns that she died more than a decade earlier how can this be i could tell you more about the plot but dont want to spoil any of the suspense see it for yourself to find out the rest of the storybr br this film gets very high marks for creating a creepy atmosphere the house black  white cinematography and music work together to make for a scary looking film as for the plot its interestingespecially because there are many twists and turnsso many that you are wondering just who is and who isnt among the undead by the end of the filmbr br the only negative is that i felt sorry for the poor snake that was needlessly killed crazy as it might sound i felt sorry for it and it hardly seemed necessarybr br also parents may want to know that towards the end there is a bit of nudity a strikingly beautiful woman appears topless but its hardly necessary for the plot
5,this series could very well be the best britcom ever and that is saying a great deal considering the competitors fawlty towers good neighbours to name just twobr br what made butterflies so superior even to the best of the best is that it did not just exemplify great classic classy and intelligent comedy but it also expanded horizons reflecting  flawlessly gently and at every detail  the great social change that was occurring in britain at the timebr br i remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it the lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself this was the first time i saw real people using cordless phones and the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies attire still seen in north america at the time then there were the decors shop fronts cars these people  even the layabout sons with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor  were sophisticated they were examples of the new europeans that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade 1980sbr br of course the premise was strange and fantastic the idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so discontent and restless was revolutionary particularly to north americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things sure the situation was depicted in american movies and tv but not with the intensity of butterflies or the movie montenegro and if the premise was not surprising enough the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme a potential affair that was not really about sex or even romance butterflies dazzled many but it must have left some people smacking their foreheads in disbelief at the time anywaybr br butterflies turned out to be  in so many ways  prophetic it documented ahead of its time  postmodern ennui allpervasive lifestyle the notion of emotional infidelity and generational disconnect and male discontent portrayed perfectly by the strained fatherson relationships it is too bad this series has not been rediscovered in a big way and all those involved given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place and foreseeing all the slickness and angst that was to come
0,a damn good movie one that is seriously underrated the songs that the children sing in the movie gave me a sense of their pain but also their hope for the future whoopi goldberg puts in a good performance here but the best performance throughout the whole movie is that of the actress who plays the title character i wish she was in more moviesbr br this movie should have a higher rating i give it a 1010
5,i wish more movies were two hours long on the other hand i wish more american civil war movies were merely two hours long gone with the wind gettysburg  thats about the length ive come to expect although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted and even gettysburg lasted as long as it did because things happened in the course of itbr br by contrast ang lees film is bloated and uneventful it actually feels as if it takes much less than two hours that wasnt a compliment its really no different to any other form of sensory deprivation at the time it feels as though it will never end afterwards it seems to have taken no time at allbr br the film gets off on the wrong foot as lee plays his interminable credits over the opening footage bad mistake in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will later come to loathe the central two are jake the son of german immigrants who are staunch supporters of lincoln and jack an equally staunch southerner whose values jake shares i had to reread that sentence to make sure i hadnt written jack instead of jake at some point or vice versa the two go off to become bushwhackers  southern militia who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that they cant even be bothered to join the official southern army which i presume they think is for sissies im afraid lee lost me right there its easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes if we have some independent reason to like them or feel as if we know them in some way then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more not so here we arent properly introduced to jake for at least an hour when we are it becomes clear hes a gormless pimple of a man who isnt a confederate by choice so much as by habit  the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does whose psychology is purely immitative the people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way i found myself cheering whenever the northern cavalry appeared on the screen i thought good  kill the rebels end the damned war let me go homebr br aggravating this problem is the horrible horrible dialogue everyone speaks in the same whining southern accent ive heard accents from all over the englishspeaking world and this is the worst of them all i dont care if southerners really did talk like that its simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours and believe me we do listen to it for the full two hours lees picture is a talky one largely because characters take so long to say what they mean in their ungrammatical sayeverythingthreetimes folksy drawl it would help if they talked faster but not much cant these people find a more efficient language in which to communicatebr br in short the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters with no inner life who talk in an offensively ugly mode of speech who dont bathe often enough to whom nothing of interest happens despite their being involved in a war good points jewel was nice to look at and so was the scenery but i have complaints even here the cinematography nicely framed looked as if someone had susbtituted colour film for black and white by mistake and as for jewel we were teased with her body but never actually allowed to gaze upon it which i think is the least we were owed
5,notice that all those that did not like and enjoy this film commented that it was not as good as the book or that it differed from the bookbr br i dont understand this type of criticism books and films are different media while books have hours and hours to develop characters and story lines films have about 120 minutes yet the film has the advantage of stimulating several senses visual audio as well as the imagination i dont care if a film is as good as or in fact has any resemblance to the book on which it is based who cares i judge it for what it isbr br this tv movie was charming an old and oftseen story prone to clich it could easily have been embarrassing however riffen and reeves pull it off one reviewer found riffen far to old i would never have guessed she was 40 when she made this film it is to her credit as an actress that she played a 2324 year old amazingly well i also think it is about the best thing reeves ever did the story could have been stronger and i agree the screen play could have used tightening nonetheless it is well worth watching clearly not a powerful love story but rather a charming romance which will leave you satisfied that love is a strong emotion and good overcomes evil and it is nice to see a love story without the obligatory f word the naked buttocks or hours of spitswapping kissingbr br lastly the musical score is excellent
3,this isnt a movie it is a collection of unrelated illconceived and poorly assembled scenes that look like the unedited results of a dim 10 year old with a minidv camera in fact i have a theory that the extremely abrasive girl in the train corridor  the one with the greasy hair deadpan stare ipod and nervous tic  probably shot it herself in a creative phasebr br if you made it further than the ten minutes i did dont bother trying to fit what you saw into the context of the european artiste mentality praised above this is a true and complete waste of time money and film that would have made william oneshot beaudine cringebr br the unfortunate part is that the endless series of vacuumpacked characters is representative of what now passes for much of humanitybr br whats next six directors shooting social intercourse at the walmart snack counter
7,you wouldnt expect a movie like this to be good and it isnt its a no budget ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a bad looking handheld cameraand its hilarious the actors obviously have never acted before and it shows in their terrible hilarious readings there is no plot to be seen the little plot i could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped and a group of zombie seems to be terrorizing a couple families the gore effects are actually some of the most sickening ive ever seen it seems the gore effects people raided a butcher shop for all the body parts and many scenes involve zombies dismembering people and eating their organs its a funny and sickening film and its about as bad as you can get in terms of any moviebr br my rating bomb 90 mins
2,okay as you can see this is one of my favorite if not favorite films this is a character drama which is absolutely hilarious the main character is a business man who is stuck in a same thing different day mentality he sees a woman looking melancholy out a window of a dance studio from his train everyday and wonders about her and decides to find out more about her he decides to join the dance class only to find out she is not the instructor from there he bonds with four other dancers and learns to enjoy dancing as well as finding out about the mysterious womanbr br there is no gratuitous or any sex involved just how a small group of people learn how friendships are formed and developedbr br this film was remade with richard gere and jennifer lopez and the new one while appealing is nowhere as enjoyable as the original the movie never made it big in america because it was not eligible for the oscars since it was broadcast on television in japan movies cannot be released on tv or they are disqualified for oscar nominations it did win numerous awards in japan for best film cast director etc for their oscar awards
0,this is a so called feelgood movies however it made me sad in a way why because i had the talent but my parents didnt let me study at the sports academy as well the fact that at the age of 12 i decided to quit soccerbr br and soccer is the red line in this movie together with the struggle youngsters have with the expectations parents have an englishindian girl and her parents with their traditions and strong family ties and on the other hand the english family with a daugther who dresses like a boy and plays soccer a combination which worries her mother this movie also lines out the lives of ordinary people as well as the indian community in england it is about believe in your dreams and live your one life where did we hear that beforebr br paraminder nagra a beautiful women plays yasminda a girl who is not interested in boys new clothes makeup and the typical 17 year old girl stuff in contradiction with her sister pinky complete the opposite of yasmindabr br a real must it is to see how a young beautiful girl struggles with the traditions of their parents and finds her luck eventually with great music from blondie curtis mayfield texas melanie c as well as indian hit songsbr br pleasant to watch but if you as myself ever played soccer and never made it to the top then this movie will make you melachonic
0,aside for being classic in the aspect of its cheesy lines and terrible acting this film should never be watched unless you are looking for a good cure for your insomnia i cant imagine anyone actually thinking this was a good movie
3,to be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes muslims use racial jokes on themselves but it is the exact opposite i realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a muslim uses s a word like this in real life it doesnt mean it is a terrorist thing it also shows how people give the muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad muslims out it doesnt mean we are all bad we just try to live day at a time like how hard it was for amair to get on a plane and how he used words like blow up or yaser saying well blow away the competition and people took it the wrong way being a muslim i know that stuff like this dont usually happen but they do and many people think bad things about muslims or afghanistan or iraq its not right things are not like that people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act i am glad a show like this came on the air there are many shows that piotr muslim people as terroristsmany people do find them funny to my opioion it is ok to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair but it is done to often and really gives muslin people a bad name
3,skullduggery is a strange strange film based on the novel ye shall know them by vercors to unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance but in spite of its honourable intentions and its wellmeaning tone skullduggery simply isnt a very good film for me the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which cant make its mind up how best to convey its message the first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the tarzan ilk later it teeters into scifi fable by the end it slips into courtroom melodramatics the differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great too jarring to overlook they stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that youre watching a muddled disorganised moviebr br an archaeological expedition into the jungles of new guinea is led by adventurer douglas temple burt reynolds one of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist dr sybil greame susan clark after an arduous trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange apelike creatures these primitive longlost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man there is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man  the missing link in the evolution of apes into humans or perhaps a race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics the archaeologists call the tribe the tropi and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery but things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist vancruysen paul hubschmid declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers he questions whether the tropi are truly human and takes his argument to the courts where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continuedbr br this was a very early film in reynolds career and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like hes in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously not that reynolds can be blamed  he has an impossible role asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a tarzan flick his character and the film are not relevant to each other clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist and there are nice supporting roles for british actors edward fox alexander knox and wilfrid hydewhite a major shortcoming in skullduggery is the lame and ineffective makeup used to give the tropi their strange hairy appearance rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids the stuckon hair merely makes them look unintentionally comical and thats just not the right idea were meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures but thats awfully hard when they look so unconvincing skullduggery is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant philosophical and stimulating the honourable intentions are there for all to see but the end result doesnt do them justice a worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless
2,this isnt another searing look at the holocaust but rather an intimate story about the events that took place on a small street in berlin and some of the people that were involved this film starts in the present time in new york city where ruth weinstein jutta lampe is in mourning over the death of her husband and family members have all gathered to her side ruths daughter hannah maria schrader slowly learns that her mother was raised by an aryan woman named lena fischer doris schade and so she travels to germany and locates the 90 year old who tells her about the events on rosenstrassebr br spoiler alertbr br lena talks about berlin in 1943 where the gestapo would hold all the jewish spouses in a building on rosenstrasse street even though they are supposed to have immunity for being married to aryans and for nine days a group of women would wait outside and shout for their release eight year old ruth svea lohde awaits for her mother to come out and has nowhere to go but she meets 33 year old lena katja riemann who takes her in lenas husband fabian martin feifel is also inside and eventually she tries to socialize with nazi officers to get them to do somethingbr br this film is directed by margarethe von trotta who is making her first feature film in almost 10 years after working in television and while this is clearly not one of her more provocative efforts she remains one of the most revered directors in europe this is not one of those nazi films where we view horrible acts of inhumanity to jews although we do see some severe treatment being issued out but instead this is more of a retelling of a small event that meant life and death to the people involved this film isnt trying to shock anyone or open the door to debates on the circumstances but what it simply wants to do is just shed a light on a small but true life event that occurred during an historical period part of the films strength comes from its actors and there are some good performances that shine through especially by riemann and young lohde and its always good to see schrader aimee  jaguar in a pivotal role this isnt a great film or something thats going to change your perspective on wwii but considering that innocent lives were put to death because of the events that took place i think that reason alone is important enough to retell this true story
4,all internet buzz aside this movie was god awful i expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything instead the film makers tried to make a serious thrillerhorror movie and they completely missed there were only a few good parts and a couple good lines by samuel jackson other than that it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes all of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie now that the movie has actually come out hopefully this joke will die dont waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash if youre looking for something thats funny and entertaining then just go to snakes on a blog
4,as with most of the reviewers i saw this on starz ondemand after watching the preview with my girlfriend she decided not to watch it from how bad the preview watched i on the other hand thought it looked weird enough to warrant a watching i mean the design of dr meso alone warranted at least a brief sweep over this title after watching it i can say that while there are some interesting aspects to it namely the browsing over the notebooks and trying to figure out the incomprehensible story its best to pass over this onebr br major spoilers ahead after making their first video for their asyetunfinished cd the lead singer cassidy kills herself in an attempt to get her boyfriend neil to notice her months later the band is trying to decide if theyre going to finish the album or not to try and see what cassidy would have wanted they go to see an old psychic friend of hers dr meso and try to contact her through him in his card reading dr meso turns up four straight death cards for the four remaining band members bad times are ahead i just wanted to make a point that later in the film they do explain that the death card really just represents change kudos to them on that at least even without the approval of their deceased friend they decide to go ahead and finish the album but while in the bathroom cassidys bestfriend dora catches a glimpse of her deceased friend when another bandmate goes in to check on her dora is standing in the dark requesting his sunglasses thats when the killing beginsbr br my main problem with the film from the very getgo is that it seems to be heavy stylized to a fault too many warping effects unnecessary zooms and a plethora of other cheap effects riddle this film an incoherent storyline doesnt help anything either while the narrative hangs together for the first part once cassidy is resurrected everything falls apart we have jumpcuts between cassidy and dr meso who mysteriously was able to get into a locked building which show they are connected in some way or another however within a few minutes of that revelation we find that cassidy really is an independent being from meso she then turns on the guy who had been helping her revenge and he scurries away in a way that calls to mind jack nicholson as the joker but not in a good waybr br from this point on the whereabouts of cassidy are shown but there are strange lapses as character moves from place to place almost out of sequence one scene we see cassidy standing at a desk when a character enters in the next shes nowhere to be found as he moves behind the desk we see her at the end of a hallway then in another room grabbing the keys which neil already has then back again not to mention that from one moment to the next cassidys mood seems to go a complete 180 without a catalyst to it one moment she wants to kill everyone although shes only wounded 90 of the characters  the next shes apologizing to everyone and walks out the door to die again sound confusing thats because it is its a jumbled mess that im sure the writer couldnt even figure outbr br as for the performances most are particularly wooden some though are interesting but overall this isnt a piece that would be known for its acting the story is the driving force behind this piece
0,a shaky handheld camera was used presumably to give the film a documentary look but the effect was so exaggerated that i started to get motionsickness just from watching it it looked like someone with cerebral palsy was holding the camera no offense meant to cp sufferers but i dont think you would expect to get much work as a cinematographer the camera work was so nauseating and so distracting that my wife and i considered it unwatchable and gave up on it after 10 minutes of torture i checked back a while later it was showing on tv and it hadnt gotten any better i suggest giving this one a miss unless you need to get rid of any bad sushi you may have eaten
2,this is an excellent but hard to find trippy world war i spy thriller in the inimitable 60s italian style from the psychedelic graphics of the introductory credits and the great score by ennio morricone to the lesbian love scene with capucine and the elaborately produced apocalyptic no mans land battle scenes with poison gas and german cavalry in full gas proof storm trooper gear this is a movie that should not be missed it is a film that captures the horrors and cruelty of war and the ruthlessness of the players on and off the battlefield apart from the battle scenes some of the production and special effects are primitive apparently because the bulk of the budget for this movie was saved for the battle scenes but for lovers of 60s cinema it should not be an issue i first saw this movie on television many years ago and had the foresight to tape it on vhs i still have the tape and enjoy watching it again from time to time
2,orca is not exactly bad but its not really richard harriss finest hour either as a demented ahablike fisherman harris gets into a game of death with a vengeful killer whale after killing the whales wife and unborn child charlotte rampling plays a whale expert who gets involved with harris she yells at him a lot about how important it is to leave nature alone he doesnt listen and somehow ends up in the arctic battling the revenge crazed whale there are no special effects to speak of except for what looks like a round mirror for a whales eye  there are endless shots of harris reflected in the eye so the audience understands that the whale knows who he is bo derek as one of harriss crew has a particularly unpleasant run in with the orca and most of the supporting cast including robert carridine will sampson and keenan wynn dont fare very well either
0,this movie was awful i had a very difficult time watching this all the way through i didnt get the point of the movie what was the point of this movie the soundtrack was bad acting was bad and the story uninspiring the two main characters in the movie were very boring and their dialog was uninteresting there was no chemistry among any of the cast members i dont know this for a fact but i suspect that most of the actors were first timers the movie could have easily been cut down to about an hour and half without losing the plot that indicates how many useless scenes there were in the movie i would have rather ha a root canal during the two hours of the movie i want those two hours back if you want to watch good funny movie that is family friendly and made by a bunch of mormons watch napoleon dynamite instead
1,superman and the mole men is quite possibly supermans toughest adventures everbr br lois lane and clark kent are sent to silsby home of the worlds deepest oil well while there some radioactive mole men come up through the oil well and explore the town jeff corey and many other townspeople try to dispose of the invading mole men can superman change the peoples ways in time to save the mole men can superman warn the people in time about the radioactive danger the mole men bringbr br in my opinion superman and the mole men is a very intelligent wellwritten and wellacted movie even though we only get to see superman fly once briefly it still makes a great superman adventure a must see for anyonebr br 1010 stars
1,bruce almighty looks and sounds incredibly stupid especially from the trailers nevertheless i found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more bruce jim carrey is angry at god and is given divine powers by him to be god for a week to see if he can do a better job morgan freeman plays a man symbolized here as god and though it isnt his usual type of film or one of his best roles he does excellent with what he is given to work with although crude at times the film does have quite a few laughs from bruce parting his soup in half like the red sea and the customers reactions to him as well as freemans seemingly laidback and wisecracking image of god it is overly exaggerated at times and there is some crude humor but overall it manages to be somewhat funny there is a decent supporting cast such as jennifer aniston lisa ann walter and steve carrell which always helps the end of the film proves to be very romantic and tearjerking and the message is clear that we should do what god has called us to do and be the miracle the film is far from perfect but still enjoyable and far better than i and many people probably would have expected especially if we see the deeper message of the filmbr br  out of 
1,this is quite the gripping fascinating tragic story quite good and for the most part pretty accurate considering it is a tv movie rather than a documentary they did create some fictional characters and combine several actual people into one character but otherwise this is a good telling of a very tragic and dark storybr br the final moments of the movie depicting the mass suicidemurder are almost directly taken from an audio recording made by jim jones this recording was made during the final 44 minutes of the peoples temples existence it is available in several places on the internet this portion of the film is almost spot on in that regardbr br to sum up a documentary this is not however it does cover most of the base elements to the peoples temple story
7,i have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiestworst attempts at one a lot of the scenes work in a plugandplay manner inserted strictly to conform to the romanticcomedy genre usually this is okay because were dealing with a genre but the challenge generally resides in making it original new and inventive this movie fails to do sobr br there is no sense of who the characters really are apart from sylvie moreaus who is the real star of this movie not isabelle blais they fit into this onedimensional clich and they become nothing more than simple puppets serving the purpose of a very light narrativebr br the pacing of the movie can become annoying rhythm lacks and the editing is filled with unnecessary closeups i should also mention the overly stylized decors making some scenes devoid of any naturally or rather making the attempt at naturally seem too obvious of course along with that you have the rightoncue sappy music which unfortunately often sounds mismatchedbr br i cant believe that a movie who makes obvious woody allen allusions ends up being this deceptive if you expect a good lighthearted romantic comedy this is not it or rather this a poor attempt at it you will only leave the theater wondering why this film has been getting such praise when cinema is now more than 100 years old and there are far superior quebecois directors making better flicksbr br les aimants is a good movie for what it is but its a bad one if you regard cinema as an art and directors as auteurs
6,having read the novel before seeing this film i was enormously disappointed by the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot i feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of brontes work and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story in the condensing of the film to a short 2hours the film lost many of the key features which make the book comprehendable and progressional thus resulting in a somewhat jumpy plot with little grounding there is no build up to the romance between rochester and jane eyre so this appears rather abrupt and unfounded since the two characters have such infrequent interaction you cannot help but imagine their love is superficial this is such an injustice to brontes novelyou are given no impression of janes quirky cheek and boldness which attracts rochester to her and his arrogance which attracts jane to himbr br despite to poor scripting i think that a few of the characters were portrayed very astutely namely mrs fairfax and grace poole however overall the production was poor given a better scripting perhaps the film would have been more successful see jane eyre 1970 with zelah clarke and timothy dalton for an outstanding production
5,ok maybe a 13 year old like me was a little to old for this movie its about this pampered rat who lives in a palace then a sewer rat flushes him down a toilet he ends up in this rat city and meets this girl rat who has a gem a greedy frog wants he will do anything for this gem he sends a whole army after these two ratshe plans to take the gem and to flood rat city the cool part about this movie is the slugs they do all the sound effects they sing make noises its awesome its also pretty funny ok bottom line it is aimed at year olds other wise a great movie to take a younger family member to see i didnt think the animation was real dreamworks art though more like wallace and gromit i thinkthey slacked a little on that the movie was just decent not worth spending 950 for though sorry
7,there are no people like show people marion davies as peggy pepper and william haines as billy boone my introduction to ms davies was a clip from this film the delightfully spoofy one in which she lowers a scarf to reveal different emotions my introduction to mr haines was in viewing this film presently though its possible ive seen him in a less memorable role haines makes an incredible impression when he joins davies for a commissary meal  tossing his hat into the ring with some wonderful bits at the dining table indeed haines and davies deliver great comic performancesbr br the story starts off with dell henderson colonel pepper driving daughter davies into hollywood certain she will become tinseltowns newest sensation indeed davies and the already arrived haines become comedy stars but davies yearns to become a true drama queen davies leaves haines and partners up with the dashingly dramatic paul ralli but audiences prefer davies in more comic roles perhaps director king vidor is offering up a case for art imitating life br br full of great hollywood location footage both on the set and off full of great cameos at a studio lunch at the stars table davies sits between douglas fairbanks and william s hart the best bit player however is charlie chaplin who has enough nerve to ask davies for her autograph while the cameos are fun they and the episodic sequences do help show people become less of an important film and more of an important historical document br br  show people 111128 king vidor  marion davies william haines dell henderson
6,ringmaster jerry springers pathetic excuse for wasting film that should be recycled as toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the art of film first of all it was made second of all people went to see it third some people voted it the best movie they have ever seen if a monkey could make a movie im 100 percent sure that it would be billion times as good most crappy movies have their moments even godzilla had a few cool special effects this films moment was when i left the theater nauseated the only thing that possibly couldve made this movie any worse would be if jerry springer was the star if i want to stare at crap for an hour and a half ill take a dump in a can if anyone didnt utterly despise this movie i pity you and your children and your childrens childrens children however contrary to springers beliefs i clearly dont condone children having sex
0,the day time ended is an incredible picture in some ways its better than close encounters of the third kind i prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars the special effects are cheesy but thats a big part of the fun jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film its probably one of the best roles he ever had in a feature the musical score is very good the story doesnt make sense but that only makes it all the more intriguing like many of the best works of art the day time ended isnt afraid to be subtle and ambiguous the day time ended may be a low budget indie film but it isnt too much of a stretch to compare it with the existential european films of the fifties and sixties many of which were low budget independent productions themselves
6,i saw it at cinema mk2 hautefeuille just one night after its first public projection in paris a very pretty film about three 15 years old teenagers all of them just at about the same psychologically stages many of the scenes let us to come back to our adolescence age  our first feelings about sexual relations it is possible to imagine that the director would like to reduce the first strong sensual feelings of the girls to lesbianism but even in that case she doesnt corrupt the likelihood of the story you can sometimes find the film a little slow but it is what creates this intimate atmosphere i fund the young actresses of talent special mention with floriane and marie very convincing there are many small details but this film also enabled me to discover what synchronized swimming is impressing
3,man this was hilarious it should be under comedy or stupid it would have made realizing what a pile of stank this was much easier seriously i want anyone associated with this movie tased effective immediately for everyone who is thinking of watching this movie lets go over a few plot points oh wait there arent any there is literally no plot i think casper van dien was bored and he decided to film something with some random someones and miraculously it somehow got on videotape this movie is literally the worst movie of all time dont believe me go watch it do it man i dare you but be prepared to gouge your eyes out if you can sit through this without blowing a cow you are very strong and courageous
1,this movie probably would only get a or from me to tell the truth if i had seen trailers or had any kind of knowledge of what the film is all about since it was virtually all a surprise it was almost a perfect piece of edgy entertainment that gets a strong from mebr br i read through some of the comments briefly and saw that someone else had almost the same experience as me and he advised to just watch it it was good advice read the rest at your own risk of spoilingbr br eva mendez plays a headstrong successstarved network tv programmer that took a joke made by a coworker while brainstorming tv program ideas about russian roulette seriously the story follows her in a documentary style on her pursuit to make this happen
0,this movie has to be the biggest pile of steaming cp i have everbr br seen what more can i say than bad bad bad bad bad bad there is nothing to save this movie and i pray that they never even talk about making a sequel if you are thinking about watching this then you should know that the storyline is that two garbage men get dragged into saving the earth movies like men in black has been torn to shreds and put back together to make this comedy but have totally failed please avoid this movie save yourself
0,i went to see this one with much expectation quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest even a child can see the missing logic to characters behaviors todays kids need creative stories which would inspire them which would make them daydream about the events thats precisely what happened with movies like et and star wars a decade ago how many kids imagined about becoming jedi knights and igniting their own lightsabers seriously dont waste your time  money on this one

0,it is a rare occasion when i want to see a movie again the amati girls is such a movie in old time movie theaters i would have stayed put for more showings was this story autobiographical for the writerdirector it has the aura of realitybr br the all star cast present their characters believably and with tenderness who would not want mercedes ruehl as an older sister i have loved her work since for roseannabr br with most movies one suspends belief because we know that it is the work of actors producers directors sound technicians etc it was hard to suspend such belief in the amati girls one feels such a part of this family how i wanted to come to the defense of dolores when her family is stifling her emotional life and wanted to cheer lee grant as she levels criticism at cloris leachmans hair color the humor throughout is not belly laugh humor but instead has a feelgood quality that satisfies far more than pratfalls and suchbr br the love that is portrayed in this cinema family is to be emulated and cherishedbr br it is no coincidence that the family name amati translated from the italian means the loved ones
3,this is the best scifi that i have seen in my 29 years of watching scifi i also believe that dark angel will become a cult favorite the action is great but jessica alba is the best and most gorgeous star on tv today
7,its 1978 and yes obviously there are too many black players on the teams as well fans will be upset and certainly the 75000 seats will be full only less happy there are so many black players on the field this made for tv super bowl movie is watchable its not much more but its really surprising the cast of talented actors that make an appearance for the time probably most notably tom selleck unfortunately any goodness selleck brings to the screen is quickly trumped by actors like dick butkusbr br its a silly story about super bowl betting pj jackson is charged by new york read mafia for ensuring the game ends for their favor in this case a 10000000 bet pj is innocent enough and seems to have a loose grasp by buying off a few people here and there but things seem to fall apart for him another person the unsuspected lainie takes charge for a while the mystery of murders isnt known for certain but is revealed rather plainly at the final murder that lainie is the new antagonistbr br its a bad movie but is watchable the acting is decent and the filming is ok at least there werent any silly typical 70s car chases they have their place just not here just keep an open mind about past stereotyping and the cocaine era and youll survivebr br 210 maybe a 25
2,there is indeed much to complain about this movie version of molnars mystical play farrell looks good in his title role but his line readings frankly stink this also suffers in large part from this being credited as the first movie that makes use of rear projection the sets look phonybr br there are two great strengths in this show however although the dialogue readings limp the visual performances are perfect rose hobart as julie is little remembered today mostly for rose hobart in which joseph cornell cut down the programmer east of borneo to simply shots of her credit melfords stylish visual direction of the original her great beauty and simple although stagy performance help repair some of the damage to the earthbound sections of this moviebr br however one of borzages themes is the mystical power of love and it is the handling of the celestial sections that make this great from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to the hot place hb warners performance here is as always perfectbr br so we have here a flawed but very interesting version i think that langs 1934 version is better as well as the celestial scenes in the henry king version of carousel the watereddown musical remake but i still greatly enjoyed this version and think you should give it a chance
0,a remake of alejandro amenabars abre los ojos but this time with a living breathing mask as a lead for the dubious advantage of an english sound track we endure tom cruises soulless performance as usual with zero depth yes the character is identified with his persona but we usually are given some character underneath that to hold our interest his empty posturing negates any erotic energy that could have been between his character and cruz or diazbr br there is an acting exercise that involves using masks to free the actor to enrich his presentation of character by verbal and body language means cruises masking only painfully emphasizes his inadequacy as an actor do see the 1997 original amenabar open your eyes
1,still crazy is without a doubt the greatest rock comedy of alltime it has been erroneously compared to this is spinal tap which it has no relation to spinal tap is a satire and quite frankly not a very good one in spite of its outing of many rock clichs unlike tap still crazy is populated by great actors great songs and great human situations you care about the people in still crazy thats all that matters oh yeah the musics pretty damn good too written by mick jones of foreigner and chris difford of squeeze american audiences were already familiar with stephen rea the crying game but would only later become familiar with bill nighy underworld love actually pirates of the caribbean ii and timothy spall the harry potter movies
3,i can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience the imagination on display the visual interpretation of the script the humor is constantly surprising the two leads are great and really carry the film my advice would be to not even watch a trailer just rent the film and watch without expectations i rented from blockbuster so it is readily available in brisbane not everyone will enjoy it but i think most people will have an opinion and thats always good unless its just that was stupid i loved this film you just dont get to see gems like this every day this should become a cult favorite give it a try you may just feel the same way about it as i do
0,this for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of marion davies she is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film i believe that lucille ball may have modeled her later career on davies style that could be termed zany beauty vidors direction is light but surehanded the story is a chestnut of course but the acting is marvelously contemporary and the starwatching element for fans of the silent era with many cameos adds to the overall fun it combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well for all movie fans who have a kneejerk reaction to watching silent films sit through this one and it may change your attitude br br 
5,as a young blacklatina woman i am always searching for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me of course when i saw this movie at the video store i thought i would enjoy it unfortunately i didnt although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant the story was simply not properly developed the movie just kept dragging on and on and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without much to contribute to the overall film had the director done a better job interconnecting the scenes perhaps i would have enjoyed it a bit more honestly i would recommend a film like raising victor over this one any day i just was not too impressed
7,all these reviewers are spot on ive seen many bad films over the years believe me and this beats the lotbr br this is not just a so bad its good exploiter waste of time but a genuine hilarious movie atrocitybr br check out the white furry monster type thingbr br wet yourself laughing at thom christophers spellweaving actingbr br gape in sheer aeclenching disbelief at the threadbare setsbr br this is one of those european coproductions no wonder we have so many wars i swear some of the people taking part in wizards of the lost kingdom arent actually aware they are appearing in a filmbr br fact i originally watched this movie on htv wales late one night while suffering from concussion and sleep deprivation i had to track down a copy several weeks later to make sure it was really this awful it is worse even than lee majors in the norseman more laughable than all of john dereks films this is truly the citizen kane of trash
7,i cant really say what i think about this movie its against the guidelines ive watched many many films and this has got to be the worst one yet extremely low budget im guessing all the money went into the slaughter house scenes cause i could of did a better job with a bw 8mm camera and a crew of monkeys it was so bad i registered just to leave a comment cause i had to tell someone movie rental place wasnt enough but this is my cents worth i suggest borrowing it from some poor sap who rented it and watch it yourself cause i sure wouldnt waste the money on it myself again now i leave you with this comment i hope your not made at the rental place when they wont refund you your money  
6,remarkable disturbing film about the truelife senseless brutal murder of a smalltown family along with the aftermath and examination of the lives of the killers dick hickok and perry smithbr br no matter how much time goes by or how dated this film may look it still resonates the utter incomprehensibility of criminal acts such as thisbr br this really traces multiple tragedies the tragedy brutality and senselessness of the murder of the clutter family a decent farm family in smalltown holcomb kansas and the wasted brutal and sad lives of hickok and smithbr br an interesting point is made in the film that neither of these two immature scared petty criminals would have ever contemplated going through with something like this alone but together they created a dangerous murderous collective personality one that fed the needs and pathology of each of them they push each other along a road of proving something to each other that they were man enough to do it to carry it out neither wants to be seen as too cowardly to complete their big score an unfortunate and dangerous residue of the desolate lives they led these were two grownup children who live in a criminals world of not backing down from dares who constantly need to prove manhood and toughness in this instance these needs carried right through to the murder of the cluttersbr br the film contains a somewhat sentimentalized look at the clutter family but the point is made these were respected lawabiding smalltown people who didnt deserve this terrifying fate the movie also gives us a sense of the young lives of hickok and smith perry smith whose early life was filled with security and love but watched in horror as alcohol took his family down a tragic path hickok poor and left pretty much to his own devices not able to see how he fit in using his intelligence and charm to con everyone he came into contact withbr br an interesting and maybe the first look at capital punishment and what ends we hope to achieve is this nothing more than revenge killing for a murder that rocked a nation at a time when we had not yet had to fully face that there might be such predators among us or does putting these guys at the end of a rope truly provide a deterent to the childish and brutal posturing of men like these is it possible to deter men who live lives of deceit operating under the radar believing they fool everyone they come into contact with to be deterred you must believe its possible you will be caught is it possible to deter these men who believe they are too clever to be caught who have committed hundreds of petty crimes and got away with them this was supposed to be a cinch no witnessesbr br when caught hickok finds he cant charm and con the agents the way he had department store clerks smith who believes he deserves such a fate anyway who seemed to be the only one who truly grasped the gravity of what they had done willingly tells the story when he learns that hickok has cowardly caved in hickok blinked first a silly game of chicken between two immature emotionally damaged dangerous menbr br fascinating psychological thriller telling a story of a horrendous crime in this nations history stunning portrayals by robert blake and scott wilson these roles made their careers
1,the woman in black was a british made for tv movie which was first broadcast on the bbc on christmave eve of 89 and again in 92 i believe it made a round on american tv on ae it was released on vhs in britain in the early 90s but went out of print a us company released it on dvd later but that version also sold out according to the website of the author of the book the rights to the movie are now owned by someone else and that it wont be released again and that there are unofficial bootlegs being sold on ebaybr br i first heard about this movie just recently on a message board and had to check it out i found a copy on ebay for about 28 bucks its certain to be a counterfeit from a seller in the far east even though the dvd says made in canada ha ha but its a good copy and you cant really fault the bootleg labels for releasing stuff that is rare out of print and lost in legal disputesbr br i love the movie its a period piece set in the 1920s with all the very authentic and quaint british settings of that time the woman in black is very atmospheric and dark for the most part the movie is very lowkey but effective and scary there is no self indulgent gore violence or much at all in special effects but the woman in black is still able to create absolutely chilling moments its a chilling classic styled ghost movie the movie itself looks like it could have been made in the 1930s except for the color without all the flash of all the modern horror movies im afraid this film will always just be a lost gem for me it places itself as one of my all time favorites
1,grey gardens is shocking amusing sad and mesmerizing i watched in amazement as ediths jr and sr bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past their existence in a dilapidated mansion which they had not left for more than fifteen years is both a comedy and a tragedy this is a film you will not soon forget
4,i dont often go out of my way to write comments but for this i had to just to warn anyone that might think that by watching this they will see a comedy this doesnt come close while the premise change in colourgenderwhatever is bad enough and has been done better many times beforethe actual transformation of two black guys into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever put on screen it would be bad enough if all that was required by the script was a change to white chicks however the wayans brothers are required to disguise themselves as two specific white women as you will have guessed by now they fail completely i have seen drag queens without makeup make more convincing women than these two do with the best special effects and makeup people that hollywood can provide its appalling add to the mix a basketball player built like a building terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course and this film hits a new personal low and i like bad movies avoid like the plague
6,i have heard a lot about this film with people writing me telling me i should see it as i am a fan of extremely bloody gory movies i got my hands on it almost right away but one thing or another always kept me from watching it until now i would have been better off not remembering i even had itbr br this movie was atrocious the worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was i know it was a story by clive barker and all and no i have not read that story but it appears to me that if you havent then you will be as i was completely clueless and utterly disappointedbr br the film begins good enough the actors are convincing the story interesting the first scene is bloody a great way to catch your attention i thought the blood looked a bit bad but seeing as it was the very first scene i did hope for improvement later on i was wrong br br the blood and effects are so horrible it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that for instance someone could knock a persons head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer wtf cgi blood did they even use any real blood at all my home made stuff looks better than any used in this film unbelievable acts of dismemberment eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head arms cut neatly off does no one remember there are bones all throughout our bodies toodark scenes every scene is either an odd yellow color or in hidden in shadowsit just gets worse and worse i found myself pointing out mistake after mistake theres just too much add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serialkiller movie turns into some demonicsupernaturalmonster movie at the endno thank you it should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway ok with a conspiracy theory thrown in and an overzealous photographer maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant plausible doableand a lot better i think than the real story that could have and should have worked instead it became a creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you and unless you read the book wellyou just wont ever understand it fiasco tragic what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential if you like mindless fake blood and gore youll love this but if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it stay away far far away
1,i get tired of my and year old daughters constantly being subjected to watch nickelodeon disney and the like it all seems to be the same old tired cartoons rehashed over and over again when my daughters couldnt go to the fair this afternoon because one of them was sick i wanted them to just relax and rest for a while i flipped the tv on and in searching for something different i flipped the channels my finger stopped channel surfing the moment i heard harveys voice i adore every single solitary thing this man has done and when i saw that he was doing voiceover work for a little duck  well i couldnt change the channel my daughters were instantly mesmerized by the cartoon and the more we watched the show together the more i grew to love it along with the message that was being portrayed its not necessarily a proponent for gay rights but rather for anyone who has ever been ostracized as a child for anything i had friends who were picked on for one thing or another  too fat too skinny too feminine being a bully not being smart enough only having one parent  you name it kids as a rule can be very very cruel to one another so i was happy to see an entertaining cartoon that actually conveyed a life message to its audience my girls already accept others as they are and dont pick on others for being different my older daughter actually stands up for her friends if theyre picked on one happens to have a single mom and that little girl is picked on quite often  it warms my heart when kassie stands up for herbr br so those of you who are condemning this show because you feel that its an advocate for gay rights or are being forced to accept certain views you clearly and completely missed the point of this poignant little cartoonbr br and if you need it explained to you  well you need more help than any television show could ever offer
0,loved this showsmart acting smart dialog great storyline with real peopleplease bring it back or make it available onlinereally miss it hope davis really shines in this show i like the idea of six degrees it really makes sense in this insane world rid yourself of those stupid reality shows and give this show a second chance please bring it back not to grovelbut please when it went off the air i watched in online and liked how i could watch it with minimal interruptions in fact online abc makes it easy to enjoy shows when you miss them on prime timegone are the days of endless taping anytime you want to bring it back i am ready
4,actually they dont but they certainly did when trying to think of a singular line that adequately summarises how terrible this entry in the series really is there were some moments that could have been good but they are mostly outweighed by their own conversion into missed opportunities and dont get me started on the badbr br the wasted opportunities are pretty obvious but i will recap them here in case anyone cares anyone who hasnt seen the film and genuinely gives a toss would be advised to stop reading at this point the first and potentially the biggest wasted opportunity was the plot with freddys longlost child now the extreme mental illness that freddy appears to suffer and i might hasten to add that less than one percent of mental patients are a threat to other people leave alone to this extent is hereditary so why not a mysterytype slasher in which lisa zanes character dreams of freddy murdering the teens only we later discover its actually her doing all the killing sound like a good plot idea to you obviously it was above the heads of talalay and de lucabr br then theres the trip to springfield where the entire adolescent population has been wiped out and the remaining adults are experiencing a kind of mass psychosis funnily enough said mass psychosis was actually depicted in a realistic and convincing manner although this has a fair amount to do with the fact that we are never shown too much we are just given quick visual hints of the massive loss of connection with reality that would stem from the grief of every youngster in town dying for reasons beyond ones comprehension and control the essential problem with this plot element however is that the town is abandoned too quickly and with no real answers this collection of scenes would have been far creepier with ten minutes of say one sane citizen explaining to these visitors why the springfield fair looks like a horror showbr br of course horror films are never noted for their character development unless theyre the kind of horror films john carpenter used to direct but how are we supposed to really care when characters we know next to nothing about die at least wes craven took the time to set up his characters in the original and used a few cheap tricks to draw the audience in that in a nutshell is probably the biggest problem with freddys dead it just doesnt try at all leave alone hard enoughbr br on a related note i feel kind of sorry for robert englund now that he is more or less inextricably linked with the freddy character he has played far better characters in far better productions the sciencefiction miniseries v for example and to be forever remembered as the man who played freddy is selling him rather short it seems he will never break the mold of horror films now as for the rest of the cast well i think their performances here speak for themselves they deserved to be permanently typecast as little more than bgrade horror props even yaphet kotto doesnt escape this one unscathed as his character is one of the most childishly written in the history of bfilmsbr br all in all freddys dead gets a out of me id vote lower but the imdb doesnt allow for that fd is really a testament to how a writers inability to exploit a concept to the fullest extent can ruin not only a film but an entire franchise
7,this is truly truly one of the best movies about love that ive ever seen closely followed by none other than before sunset which technically isnt another movie at all since its about the same two people and the same romancebr br this is love in the real world ok thats only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leads in the movie reading the other reviews it pleases me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialogbased movies as well and this is what makes before sunrise so good the dialog is perfect its so real so engaging and funny its hardly a surprise that jesse and celine fall in love coz you fall in love with them at the very same timebr br my favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop where they pretend to phone their best friends with the other pretending to be said best friend its perfect brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your lifebr br i must say that if you have a choice do watch before sunrise before watching before sunset if like me you watched sunset first its hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire showbr br once again the greatest romantic movie in my books wonderful acting excellent script and beautiful locations young love at its best
2,simons best comedy is superbly crafted by director gene saks and given life by the immense talents of lemmon and matthau no one delivers these lines better no one times them better nobody does it better
0,went to see the movie troy this afternoon heres what i learnedbr br contrary to popular opinion and history in general greek men were not gay ever this was clearly established immediately at the start of the film and reinforced every five minutes or so thereafter so it is safe for american dudes to see this moviebr br helen of troy always had impeccable hair and makeup she looked gorgeous in all of her brief cameo scenes which though numerous were probably all filmed on the same day one after the other with the director saying alright now look beautiful    good  ok now look frightened  good now look depressed  good  now look interested    good  now look beautiful again  goodbr br most greek and trojan men had british accents those with american accents couldnt actbr br trojans looked just like greeks but they tended to stay on the right side of the screenbr br brad pitt does not blink on camerabr br helen of troys biggest line was theyre coming for mebr br trojan music sounded remarkably like modern bulgarian musicbr br brad pitts thighs go all the way upbr br achilles had a young male friend with whom he was very close but its ok they were cousins never mind what history saysbr br peter otoole can tell an entire story with just an expressionbr br trojan gods apparently all had greek names but their statues either looked egyptian or like peter otoole in dragbr br greek men never touched each other unless they were fighting much like american menbr br all of the thousands of extras in the movie had exactly the same skin color light egyptian by max factorbr br troy had only three womenbr br there were lots of blond greeks which is good news for brad pitt who would otherwise have really stuck outbr br despite their coastal desert locale greeks had the uncanny ability to find unlimited amounts of timber to build fires funeral pyres trojan horses and the likebr br british actors look silly with greek hairdosbr br brad pitt changes expression only when the sun is shining directly in his eyesbr br greek soldiers fought constantly but their outfits always looked impeccablebr br greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirtsbr br apparently greek temples were always in ruins even back when they were all new
7,to die for 1989 was just another dtv feature that made an appearance on cable ad nasuem during the early nineties the only thing notable about this feature was the last movie duane jones appeared in other than that theres no reason to watch this vampire flick unless you like pseudo chick flicks masquerading as a horror film a tired vampire longs for love and searches the back streets of la looking for it will he succeed or will vlad just strike out again like he has for the last centurybr br this movie must have been big because a couple of sequels soon followed theyre so bad they make this one look like a classic i know this is a movie about vampires but the film makers could have used to lightingbr br not recommended by me because i didnt like itbr br nuff said
0,from the creators of shrek ok that grabbed my attentionbr br well the creators of shrek also made madagascar madagascar was half as good as shrekbr br and now flushed away is half as good as madagascarbr br that means flushed away isnt good the animation and all that special effects were extremely good but the movie wasntbr br the story of this movie was only meant for kids its seriously not possible for adults to actually love this flickbr br but there were many jokes meant for adults i bet kids dint understand the jokesbr br despite that i dint like this flickbr br i am completely disappointed 410
7,after a love triangle story in har dil jo pyaar karega these stars were again chosen in this controversial flick the film would have been considered as hit if there was not a controversy with the production values from bharat shah here director duo abbasmustan did a very different and unique job as compared with their previous and after directorial ventures they are considered as thriller makers of bollywood but in this cccc they proved that they can equally handle to make a romantic family drama hardly there is a single action scene when preity was being raped by salmans colleague in her apartment salman slapped himbr br the movie has almost all the standards and ingredients like song story casting performances etc which are required to make a movie hit but of course for salmans fan this was something a surprise gift from him why because for so long he has been doing roles where he has a scene to show his open body and dance lalala all around his role as a rich young businessman who has nononsense nature and of normal attitude is really impressive after all madhubala a prostitute role performed by preity is amazing later when she too turns out thoughtful about her life she deserve proper attention her facial expressions and body language become more attractive and focus mainly goes to her her previous role as a pregnant woman in kya kehna was not that hearttouching as it is here of course this can be termed as improvement then priya a very innocent and helpless wife of raj who only depends on him for a better result she has nothing powerful influence in the story as the main ingredients are in the hands of preitybr br finally the main point of the story which is something rare and unique in itself in real world of this age it is not totally impossible to happen such step of searching for a surrogate mother perhaps many are happening in this large world where these are kept secret and in this way the scriptwriter of cccc has uncovered a hidden truth which is taking place in others daily lives but still then it is a doubt
0,this was a topnotch movie with a topnotch cast danny glover tony danza joseph gordonlevitt and especially christopher lloyed are wellcast in this charming movie about reallife angels helping the angels baseball team you never know it could happen i loved lloyds role in it he was hilarious the story is about turning your life around as the kids belief in angels helped turn around angry hardened and embittered manager glover see the best in people the movie was well made and also about seeing the best in people and reaching your dreams it was funny charming touching and sad all very nicely done you will like or love it i guaranteebr br  out of 
3,with various bogdanoviches and gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew they all laughed is very much a family affairif you add the fact that bgazzara and miss ahepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary considerationif this all smacks of smug in  joke self gratification you will be pleased to hear that mr bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent i love ny paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late miss hepburn make no mistake this is her picturemr gazzara concedes it to her most self  effacingly in all their scenes together the plot  a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients affairs  is of minimal importanceit is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie mr bogdanovichs triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actorsfrom targets onwardsthere is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipmentmiss hepburn in particular benefits from this love extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directorsprincipally who the hells in it recently remaindered in uk bookstores the soundtrack to they all laughed varies from louis armstrongs 1947 new york town hall concert to sinatra to country to latinas eclectic as the city it portrays mr bs golden boy image was sure to tarnishfor such is the nature of the movie businessbut it is equally sure one day to be restoredand when that day comes they all laughed will be recognised for the fine work that it is
1,great acting great movie if you are thinking of building see this movie first the dollar amounts may have changed but everything else is the same the humor is true to life and emotions are those that anyone who has built has felt
7,this is one of those so bad it is good films that you always hear about but never see unlike troma films which are deliberately bad and campy and i am not amused this one is 100 pure seriousbr br however with features such as a supposedly superlethal killer robot that prances about like one of the solid gold dancers on an acid trip and a magical first mate that calls down lightning and transforms into the good witch of the east the fact that it takes itself seriously pushes it so far over the edge of bad that makes it full circle around back to entertainingbr br watcheable enough because of that
3,i saw this movie in its own time period when having a baby out of wedlock not only ruined your life but stamped your child as a bastard in these days of single mothers that may seem very farfetched but it was very true and im not crazy about laughing at someone who is stammering either between these two problems i had difficulty finding this movie funny at that time i didnt know who had directed it or what a marvelous reputation he had i did know who betty hutton was and she just made me nervous because she was so frenetic i loved bringing up baby but i find this movie just embarrassing im sure the punch at some church functions probably was spiked but i was the one needing a drink after watching this again the idea the girl would have to be drunk in order to get married and get pregnant just added to the misery an entire town could turn on you under these circumstances so the outcome of this movie is really the funny part of course shoot me i dont like its a wonderful life either
7,theres more to offer in the opening of the odd couple than in the entirety of most films felix unger the poor guys monogram even curses him checks into a new york hotel a cleaning lady says good night goodbye he answers back in his room he empties his pockets then struggles to take off his wedding ring only to put the objects neatly into an envelope addressed to his wife and beloved children when the viewer finally puts it together  aha hes going to off himself  we watch him struggle to open the window  oh no hes going to jump  the poor guy injures his lower back this is all you need to know about felix unger  his wife has left him hes a compulsive cleaner and hes a hypochondriac and all in one scene this is the particular genius of neil simons comedy  its about situation and character there are few obvious physical jokes  no kicks to the groin no cheap gags  just funny characters in uncomfortable situations and of course he is a master of manipulating the audiences expectations coming from the swingers era imagine what i thought in the date scene when felix starts lamenting about the breakup of his marriage to the girls his roommate oscar has worked so hard to get into his apartment hes blowing it right think again the girls love his sensitivity his ability to cry in front of them they invite him back to their place since his meatloaf has burned because oscar wasnt paying enough attention to it hes in like flynn right uh yes but he doesnt want to go with the girls because hes feeling vulnerable great stuff and its made even greater with a style that minimizes editing and maximizes the wonderful eightroom apartment set youve got jack lemmon and the slouchy pouchy walter matthau for chrissakes why mess it up the visual style reminded me of breakfast at tiffanys in that great effect is made from a large depth of field and the interplay between the various planes of action particularly memorable is the scene in which felix fleeing from oscar closes a partition only to realize the partition doesnt cover the side where oscar is coming from you get a real sense of the layout of the apartment and thus the proximity in which the two divorces live the twist here is that these two are really married  to each other so the observations about married life that might be ignored in an ordinary romantic comedy are made all the more poignant since they are two guys
3,after watching this i thought to myself there are either too few good writers  directors or lots of producersbr br at any rate this is a terrible movie terrible in a way that its not fun but rather makes you grit your teeth and quiver makes you shout this is wrong at the movie immersion is zero by now most of you are probably used to the terrible errorsweirdnesses in movies that has computers hackers etc in them this movie is like that in every aspect br br the only good thing about the movie is the little girl emily brilliantly played by eliza bennett i hope she becomes big and make this thing at least worth somethingbr br do yourself a favor dont watch this there is not even proper action in it total waste of time
0,this movie was terrible at first i just read the plot summary and it looked ok so i watched it the acting was terrible it was like the actor were almost camera shy everything seemed fake i feel bad for edward furlong terminator was my favorite a few years ago ive watched it at least 20 timesbr br the plot was also crap the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the linesbr br on the plus side its the good kind of bad movie the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get so that later you can tell other people how you couldnt believe how terrible the movie wasbr br i think everybody should watch this so that then we could appreciate better other real movies
2,fascinating movie based on a true story about an australian woman lindy chamberlain meryl streep accused of killing her baby daughter she insists that a dingo took her baby but the story is highly suspicious the film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case the way australians interpreted what was presented in the media and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the womans conviction based on barely any hard evidence i love films that question the media and also films that take a hard look on how people are railroaded by the justice system ive always thought that juries ought to be showed 12 angry men before they go through with their duties its not as has often been said a liberal movie but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge a cry in the dark is likewise clinical schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic some may find the film boring or dry but i found it engaging
2,this wasnt the major disaster that i was expecting but that is about as positive as i can be in my description of the movie im not sure what was meant to be funny about this movie but i suppose its all a matter of taste personally i dont find it funny to watch morons living their idiotic lives or making fools of themselves on television but then again im not a fan of jerry springers pathetic daytime talk show i didnt get too bored watching this but i was definitely never enjoying it either if youre in the mood to see a bad movie but one that isnt too painful to sit through this is a good choice
0,the first von trier movie ive ever seen was breaking the waves sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa europa tells a story of a young germanamerican who wants to experience germany just after the second world war he takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train because of his job he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany meeting with the killing of traitors and hunt for former nazi party members the society is suffering from corruption his uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train by coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called werewolves they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains the atmosphere is astounding the viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene just when you think youve seen a lot europe
2,wow i really liked this movie william h macy is great as the quiet hitman alexbr br all the performances here are really good the plot is interesting and entertainingbr br alex a married hitman like his fatherwith a little son is going through a middle age crisis and wants to quit the family business so he goes to the psychiatrist for help and in this place he meets the young free will spirit sarah of whom he falls in love to one day alex doesnt know what to do when he gets a job to kill a person he knows br br i recommend you to watch it if you like mature interesting moviesbr br stars  very good
2,we bought this film from a shop called poundland we were looking for more inspiration as we have previously bought the film no big deal an remade itbr br we expected this film to be badly inspirational so that we might remake it and put it on the tube however this was shocking boring is the main word that comes to mind the bad effects and script arent enough to make you watch it the main womans body seems to be whipped out at opportune moments in a pathetic attempt to keep the viewer interested however it just makes you wonder did they blow the budget getting her to take her clothes off if so id have asked for a refund it looks like a homemade film the shots dont even correspond with each other and the camera work is so amateur it makes our remakes of bad movies look professional i cannot believe that this is being sold as a marketable productbr br it is just boring and ugly to watch the actors are bad and there is no degree of professionalism about it there are no words to describe how terrible it is
1,a very engaging documentary about scottish artist andy goldsworthy whose work consists mostly of ephemeral sculptures made from elements from nature his work is made of rocks leaves grass ice etc that gets blown away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field thus most of goldsworthys works dont really last except as photos or films of what they were now one can argue that goldsworthys works are a reflection of mortality or words to that effect but isnt it easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art and at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter pretentious often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings goldsworthy seems to be the opposite a stable unpretentious family oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small village in scotland of course im sure those are the same reasons why hes shunned by some people on the art world who found his works fluffy or superficial
7,first off im a dedicated fan of modestys and have been reading the comics since i was a child and i have found the earlier movies about our heroine unsatisfying but where they fail this one rocks br br well then here we go ms blaise is working for a casino a gang of robbers comes along and she starts gambling for her friends lives if the robber wins one round shell have to tell him about herself if she wins two times in a row one of the staff members goes free sounds stupid yeah well im not that good at explaining either br br she tells him about growing up in a war zone without parents or friends about her helping an old man in the refugee camp and how they escape living by natures own rules they hunt for food and he teaches her to read and fight as they approach civilization they get caught up in a war and as they are taken for rebellions they are being shot at and the old man dies which leaves her to meet the city by herselfbr br then she meets the man whos casino shes now working for and there the story ends br br what is to follow is that theres an awesome fight and the lines are totally cool alexandra staden is a terrific modesty blaise just as modest and strong graceful and intellectual as the comiconebr br feels awkward though too hear modesty speak with a slightly broken accent but thats not relevant since the comic book blaise cant speak out loud but certainly must have a somewhat existing accent not to mention that its weird everybodys speaking english in the balkanbr br the acting is really good even the child who personifies the young blaise must have a applaud br br my favorite part must be where she rips up her dress to kick the stupid robbers ass totally awesome d i cant wait until the real adventure begins in the next moviesbr br watch it you wont be disappointed
5,shown in australia as hydrosphere this incredibly bad movie is so bad that you become hypnotised and have to watch it to the end just to see if it could get any worse and it does the storyline is so predictable it seems written by a high school dramatics class the sets are pathetic but marginally better than the miniatures and the acting is woodenbr br the infant muppet seems to have been stolen from the props cupboard of total recall there didnt seem to be a single original idea in the whole moviebr br i found this movie to be so bad that i laughed most of the way throughbr br malcolm mcdowell should hang his head in shame he obviously needed the money
0,as this movie is completely in swiss dialect its probably hard for most german speakers to really follow this movie im not from switzerland but i worked there for some years so i had the chance to understand this great spoof of the lord of the rings ive seen a lot of movies of this kind eg scary movie loads of scifi spoofs etc but this one is the best one of that kind ive seen so far i give a of 10 the only reason i cant give a 10 is because there are some little details which could have been done better and because they supplied no subtitles in any language on the dvd so theres almost no chance for nonswiss to understand
0,oh my god the worst sht ive ever seen this is the main thought which came into my mind right after watching the movie and i really do not understand anybody with opposite myth though maybe the idea was good but the effect miserable i especially mean the role of h graham what was that in my opinion it has destroyed all positive intentions of producers the character was played in affected and annoying way every time she appears it reminds that you re watching a movie and is destroying a spirit of the moment then whole movie because the most time what you can see there are her stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create the emotion terrible dont waste your time
0,i didnt know what to expect from ned kelly but absolutely loved it it was dark dramatic and gripping it also felt very authentic i felt that i had been transported back to the 1800s ive never been much of a heath ledger fan having only seen him in teen type movies however he is quite compelling in this role ledger plays ned kelly with dignity and intensity showing us how an highly spirited boy became australias most notorious killer naomi watts is great in a supporting role as kellys society lover highly recommended  and thats from an aussie
0,in my years of attending film festivals i have seen many little films like this that never get theatrical distribution and they end up in the bins at walmart i just found dvd of yank tanks there great doc but how sad for it to end up as a rockbottom remainderbr br i loved this film wish id seen it at the cinema in its everything id have preferred that new yorker films had translated the title directly its good for americans to stretch a little if the films title helps the us audience to explore random chaos all the better cinema imitates life  visa versabr br also i found it distracting that the subtitles put prices in dollars come on the euro is not hard to figure out make the gringo audiences do the math seeing a film especially one shot in paris the viewer should not have the effect spoiled by being reminded i am an american watching a movie and they are translating the euros into dollars for me br br looking forward to seeing more of these actors and more from the writer  director as well
0,a movie about a bunch of some kind of filmmakers who want to make a documentary on a new kind of surfing in sharkinfested waters as an absolute fan of movies including some kind of vicious animals or monsters i thought this might be my kind of movie it wasnt this should be more of a guideline of how not to do it it has a lot of accidental humor in it and the evil beast is an incredible joke in the final scene it goes after the main characters rolling the feet are obviously waving in the air it looks ridiculous good for a laugh though if it were only for the lack of talent between the actors the embarrassingly stupid dialogs and the hilariously stupid crocodile it would be at least worth a laugh but it gets worse id guess the people in charge of this movie noticed how weak it was so they though up the old idea of sex sells totally i mean totally without any reasons one of the main actresses shows her breasts to the beast and somewhere towards the beginning theres some kind of meaningless makeout this is the last ingredient making the movie absolute trash to me its incredible how people actually spend time producing such rubbish if you are seeking for a real waste of time watch this movie
7,as if there werent enough of those floating around at the time already we have here another lame godfather clone from the director of il consigliori 1973 which i had watched earlier this year the marqueevalue name roped in this time is telly savalas who belatedly enters the proceedings and is first seen from behind rather campily tending to his flowers and wearing a beret in the style of french painters apart from not looking minimally sicilian he sports no accent of any kind other than his familiar drawl antonio sabato then makes for an unlikely gangster  apart from being a resistible leading man his relationship with savalas which becomes paternal at the flick of an eye is also unconvincing especially since he subsequently becomes romantically involved with the latters spirited teenage niece besides for a gangster flick theres precious little action to speak of and none of it is in any way memorable though the finale set in a clinic is well enough handled furthermore the score by francesco de masi is serviceable but nothing else incidentally the bargainbasement dvd i rented starts off midway through the credits so that none of the cast members  or even the films title  is ever listed
6,id have to say that this was a little embarrassing for the king of the cowboys made in 1948 the picture came out a decade after roy rogers earliest pictures in which he had a starring role roys character comes off as a bit clueless in this one along with his female costar jane frazee who alternates her allegiance between roy and robert livingston portraying chief bad guy bill regan the whole story seems kind of muddled with missed opportunities for what could have been an entertaining hour or so like the legend of the hangmans hotel for example which says the hanged man comes to life at midnight with andy devine in the cast as cookie bullfincher you would think the story would get a little mileage out of that set up instead you have some convoluted proceedings that would have been better served if this had been a bowery boys flick it was a sad attempt at a haunted hotel gimmick that relied on poor old genevieve who truth be told wound up getting more screen time than trigger whos contract as smartest horse in the movies didnt have anything to say about getting upstaged by a mule and then you have foy willing and his riders of the purple sage replacing bob nolan and the sons of the pioneers for your musical interlude i dont know about you but it was already half way into the picture and i was still looking for pat brady  oh well br br yet there was still an interesting element to be found here if you were looking hard enough and that turned out to be roys athletic dismount of trigger while still on the run from the bad guys ok it was probably a stunt double but i havent seen that one before in a couple hundred westernsbr br jane frazee does the honors as the female lead in this picture as she would in four other films opposite roy in the 19471948 time frame in under california stars she appeared as andy devines cousin appropriately named caroline bullfincher youre never quite convinced what side shell come in on in this story though since she starts out pretending to be someone shes not and winds up on the good guy side almost by accidentbr br fans of the old laurel and hardy films might be as surprised as i was to see james finlayson here as the sheriff of sintown i would have liked a little more comedy relief written into his role but he played it pretty straight after all i had to wonder when it was all over why he and old vanderpool charle coleman wound up in the mine shaft with cookie when there was no reason for that to be just a way to close it out i guess with about as much thought as went into the rest of the picture i hate to be that harsh but if youve seen enough roy rogers flicks youve got to know that this was not one of his finer effortsbr br say sintown  i wonder if thats the same place that grew up to be sin city
1,when i first saw this film on cable it instantly became one of my favorite movies im a big fan of james earl jones and robert duvall the movie paints an accurate picture of the south and the racist attitudes most of the attitudes came from soll an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor soll is what makes the move his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way the south was back then i suppose that if soll lived today he would be diagnosed with alzheimers disease none the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex while he has racist views hes grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black the two convicts he trusts most are jacksonmel winkler and benjames earl jones the conversations between ben and soll are the best in the movie they have real chemistry james earl jones and mel winkler both but in great performances as well as hassbr br this movie should have gotten more notoriety however its on dvd and worth the moneybr br rayvyn
7,midnight cowboy was rated x with the original release back in 1969 there are some scenes where you can understand that just a little the movie about joe buck jon voight coming from texas to new york city to become a hustler is sometimes a little disturbing dressed up as a cowboy he tries to live as a hustler making money by the act of love it does not work out as he planned after a guy named rico ratso rizzo dustin hoffman first pulled a trick on him and stole some money they become friends they live in an empty and very filthy apartment then ratso gets sick and joe has to try to make some moneybr br the movie was probably rated x for the main subject but on the way we see some strange things the editing in this movie is great we see dream sequences from joe and ratso interrupted by the real world in a nice and sometimes funny way dustin hoffman jon voight and the supporting actors give great performances especially hoffman delivers some fine famous lines the score is done by john barry and sounds great all this makes this a great movie that won the best picture oscar for a good reason
4,the fact that this movie has been entitled to the most successful movie in switzerlands film history makes me shake my head its true but pitiful at the same time a flick about the swiss army could be a good deal betterbr br the story sounds interesting at the beginning antonio carrera michael koch gets forced to absolve his military training by the army while he is in the church wedding his love laura moretti mia aegerterbr br the acting in some way doesnt really differ from just a few recruits getting drunk and stoned in the reality melanie winiger plays her role as the strong michelle bluntschi mediocre personally i found her rather annoying br br the storyline contains a comedy combined with a romance which does not work as expected the romancepart is too trashy and the comedypart is not funny at all its just a cheap try and does not change throughout the whole movie whatsoever its funny for preadolescent 1213 year olds but not for such as those who search an entertaining comedy the humor is weak except for some shotsbr br dope cool stealing cool if you want a proper comedy about the swiss rs make sure you did not absolve your military training yet and even then dont expect too muchbr br ill give it out of 10 stars because marco rima is quite funny during his screen time not a hell of a lot screen time though
6,despite reading the initial comments from someone who curiously disliked the film  why is the only negative comment very first on the listit was very nice to note that virtually everyone else loved it obviously the church wanted to stress certain points and portray the prophet joseph smith in a positive manner  thats the whole idea and in fact those points were extremely effective we already know joseph smith was human but despite that and all of the horrific negative attempts stirred on by the adversary it showed just how he was able to complete a remarkable godgiven work id recommend it to anyone
0,and finally old old michael corleone falls over and goes thump who really did the writing for this last installment of the godfather saga probably the same staff who does as the world turns this flick doesnt deserve the title godfather at all lets call this one the cosas of our nostras or all my capos as someone whos encountered a number of mafia people in my business life i can say without exception that ive never met any mobster as inwardlyconflicted and contemplative as michael corleone lets face it these guys are in the mafia solely because theyre greedy nothing more in this film don corleone spends lots of time pondering his past deeds and his bleak future perhaps even the afterlife then recovers remarkably fast in order to pull off some fantastic business deal or order the death of this one or that one like the big time operator he is deep down then theres his failed marriage after the breakup scenes in g2 we may hope that michael  kay will reunite as man and wife but here they seem to just become very good platonic friends who can laugh  cry  share intimate thoughts about their lives its as if the screenwriters try to make michael into a woman its bizarre behavior for two people who shared the passion of the marriage bed for years theres some miscasting here and there or perhaps theyre sins of authorship poor oldcountrybeautiful sophia coppola is saddled with a hopeless role with too many short lines in the film that dont fit what a young woman would say in casual conversations  was given remarks rather than lines to emote her passionate lovemaking scene with andy garcia looks like something from a bad teen sex comedy as they chew their openmouthed kisses and fondle each others backsides on the kitchen drainboard like marionettesscullery sex was brought off wonderfully by glenn close and michael douglas but its just laughable here then theres andys character vinnie mancini whos also given a difficult  thankless role to play hes expected i guess to be the new new don corleone but hes almost handed the job on a silver platter and has to do little to strengthen his position unlike michaels simultaneous hits on all families in g1 this handmedown process may be an authentic way of transferring power in a mafia family but why is so much made of this boring routine certainly don vincent may earn the respect of his fellow gangsters someday but theres little character revelations in the script to give us a portrait of this young man sadly puzo did such a fine job of quickly  concisely developing michaels character in g1 but g3 has no economy in its storytelling and we suffer through drawn out expositories until we just want to take a snooze thirdly george hamilton was also handed a thankless task in taking over as family lawyer after robt duvall reportedly turned down a 3rd installment as tom hagen george wisely underplayed his role so it came off without damage to the actor the development of connie corleones character is interesting but it goes too far when she takes murderous matters into her own hands she could well end up sleeping with the fredos if this were the real world but its not all bad the assassination scene in the hotel penthouse is nifty also they keep pulling me back in or words to that effect is a great line and we recover some oldcountry feel as we get to go back to sicily even if its all done in 1989 and theyve got modern cars  haircuts the plot lines involving the corrupt hierarchy of the catholic church are pretty interesting since its based on some actual financial shenanigans at banco vaticani in the 1980s but its brought too far again with the toospectacular death scenes etc the grand opera scenes are very dramatic and well photographed but the death scene of mary toward the end is an unbalanced attempt of emotionalmanipulation at best all screenwriters need to learn that we dont always need more and more death in order to bring a mafia movie to a successful conclusion you feel sorry for kay that her daughter is dead she plays her grief so well but michaels reaction is hammy hammy hammy then michael dies sometime in the 21st century in sicily alone on a grand estate of heartfailureno grandson to play with before his demise no wife to grieve for him what should have happened in the last 12 of this movie is michael being tracked down by someone like rudy guilliani put on trial all his dirty familys sleazy little enterprises and bloodthirsty indulgences brought into the light of day michael then convicted under rico statutes and sent to federal prison for lifethen he can keel over dead from heartfailure while mopping a floor in leavenworth thats how mafia dons were ending their careers in the late 80s and early 90s and they got much better treatment than what they deserved
7,having read some of the other comments here i was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised reality check the original series wasnt that good i think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and daisy dukes legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted the duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks the shrunken boss hog was too cretinous to be evil and rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment its amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first seriesbr br back to the movie if you watch this film in its own right not as a direct comparison to however you remember the tv series then its not bad at all the real star is of course the general lee the car chases and stunts are excellent and thats really what doh is all about johnny knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with seann william scott as cousin bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious dumbanddumber sort of way the tv series never achieved the lovely jessica simpson is a natch as miss daisy burt reynolds makes a much improved boss hog and mc gainey makes a believably nasty rosco p coltrane the way he always should have beenbr br if you dont like slapstick humour and crazy car stunts then you wouldnt be watching this film anyway because you should know what to expect otherwise if you want an entertaining caraction movie with a few good laughs thats not too taxing on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind
7,just cause is a flawed but decent film held together by strong performances and some creative though exceedingly predictable writing sean connery is an antideath penalty crusader brought in to save a seemingly innocent young black man blair underwood from the ultimate penalty to set things right connery ventures to the scene of the crime where he must contend not only with the passage of time but a meddling sheriff laurence fishbourne twists and turns and role reversals abound  some surprising some not  as the aging crusader attempts to unravel the mystery the climactic ending is a bit ludicrous but just cause is worth a look on a slow night
6,ive been willing to put up with a lot from latespringsummer action fluff movies but in general thats been due to the fact that most of them have reasonable payoff ie cool special effects interesting plot twists comic value steve buscemi etc this movie however had none of this all that we got was the cheap thrill of several minutes of eva longorias cleavage an issue of maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket there is an embarrassing lack of plot suspense back story character development continuity etc i would get into specifics but quite frankly ive alreadymaybe willinglyforgotten most of the moviebr br the entire time i was in the theater i was kicking myself for not just spending the afternoon watching a 24 season on dvd save your money on this one folks unless you really really really like eva longorias cleavage
2,imagine turning out the lights in your remote farmhouse on a cold night and then going to bed theres no need to lock the doors the only sound is the wind whistling through the trees sometime after midnight a car with lights off inches up the driveway moments later an intruder beams a flashlight into your darkened living roombr br what makes this image so scary is the setting a remote farmhouse  at night based on truman capotes bestselling book and with bw lighting comparable to the best 1940s noir films in cold blood presents a terrifying story especially in that first act as the plot takes place largely at night and on rain drenched country roads its the stuff of nightmares but this is no dream the events really happened in 1959br br two con men with heads full of delusions kill an entire kansas family looking for a stash of cash that doesnt exist director richard brooks used the actual locations where the reallife events occurred even the farmhouse  and its interior it makes for a memorable and haunting filmbr br both of the lead actors closely resemble the two reallife killers robert blake is more than convincing as perry smith short and stocky with a bum leg who dreams of finding cortez buried treasure scott wilson is almost as good as dick hickock the smoothtalking con artist with an allamerican smilebr br after their killing spree the duo head to mexico things go awry there so they come back to the us stealing cars hitchhiking and generally being miserable as they roam from place to place but its a fools life and the two outlaws soon regret their actions the films final twenty minutes are mesmerizing as the rain falls the rope tightens and all we hear is the pounding of a beating heartbr br even with its somewhat mundane middle act in cold blood stages in riveting detail a reallife story that still hypnotizes nearly half a century later its that setting that does it do you suppose people in rural kansas still leave their doors unlocked  at night
6,i admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of hisher reluctant guardian ive seen enough of them  baby boom kolya about a boy mostly martha and to some extent whale rider  to expect to be bored by the formula what held my attention in the king of masks was the grimness of the setting smalltown china in the 1930s extreme poverty was the norm and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market when wang discovers his purchased grandson whom hes nicknamed doggie is a granddaughter he initially casts her out even though shes showed great promise as streetperforming heir even after he reluctantly takes her back hes not too upset when shes kidnapped the film is gritty then showing the lengths to which a young streetsmart girl had to go to survive in that societybr br the two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context in a western society one would expect at least a hint of resentment from wang at not having achieved more material success wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status though that i did too while doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern suburban child its completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage and after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her her fierce attachment to wang makes perfect sensebr br the peek at smalltown life in a foreign country the naturalness of the two lead actors the surprising plot twists and of course the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film
2,i took a flyer in renting this movie but i gotta say it was very very good on all fronts script cast director photography and high production values etc proves eva longoria parker is head and shoulders in romcom above bad actors such as kate hudson and jennifer aniston who mug and call it acting whoda thunk itbr br parker and isla fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to hold out for projects as good as over her dead body lake bell is excellent too and this is the first time i have seen her and finally paul rudd gets to shine in a really good movie instead of lesser filmsbr br a movie like this never gets its dues from closeminded males its too bad as other imdb reviewers here have noted there is nothing lame about this gem no hack writing or acting br br and its depiction of contemporary la and california in general makes every scene look bright beautiful clean and otherwise outstanding in every way never before has a movie made la look so good ah what a little talent and a lot of caring can do for a moviebr br i wont divulge the plot but as a longtime and hardcore atheist i was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme in order to enjoy an excellent and lighthearted piece of entertainment it reminds me very much of the old topper movies which were also so enjoyablebr br this movie exposes popular but otherwise hackneyed movies like ghost for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap fests they are we already know the public taste leans heavily toward the mediocre some of us save our praise for the truly worthy howeverbr br if you have enjoyed other overlooked gems such as into the night with michelle pfeiffer jeff goldblum and clu gulager blind date with bruce willis and kim basinger american dreamer with jobeth williams chances are with robert downey jr christopher mcdonald and cybil sheppard making mr right with john malkovich etc youll enjoy this br br a firstrate job all around even if its kinda hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years but even that plot device doesnt detract from the movies overall excellence
6,la coda dello scorpione aka case of the scorpions tail was director sergio martinos followup to the wonderful giallo strano vizio della signora wardh this is the quintessential giallo featuring all the aspects fans of the genre have come to know and love twisty plot beautiful girls black gloves sharp blades and a bit of gore all come together to make one heck of a piece of italian exploitationbr br a group of gialli favorites both in front of and behind the camera work to make this one of the best nonargento gialli around theres the aforementioned martino adding his touches as director giallo great ernesto gastaldi as the writer bruno nicolai creating the music and a host of giallo stars and starlets such as george hilton character actor luigi pistilli and the fetching anita strindbergbr br with all this talent behind it does scorpione deliver you bet the film works on many different levels its a thrilling murder mystery a tense and violent horror film and a suspenseful thriller all in all one of the best gialli aroundbr br martino definitely knows what fans want when it comes to gialli at some points in the film he almost seems to be channeling argento in his approach for example there is a direct ripoff of the scene in bird with the crystal plumage where the killer tries to break through the door that actually outdoes argentos flickbr br are there any problems with the flick hmmm only minor ones first any scenes that arent following the murders or the budding romance between the two leads begin to bore but just before you fall asleep the killer will pop out of nowhere and youll be right back in the swing of thingsbr br also towards the end the twists get a little too bizarre i mean what purpose did the scorpion pins really serve if you dont play close attention to the dialogue you could easily become lost with the twisting weaving storylinebr br but these minor quibbles aside la coda dello scorpione is a tense suspenseful classy and all around entertaining film for giallo fans seek it out
3,it is not the same as the other films about dancing a few normal people found themselves from dancing unlike the dancing films in hollywood the characters in this film are not handsome or hot young people they are someone that you may see everyday in your offices they are some depressed about their lives and finally find themselves and their dreams from dancing this touches me very deeply
1,every so often a movie comes along that knocks me down a notch and reminds me that my taste in films i seek out to watch isnt always impeccable i normally would stay away from stuff like this but i was duped by some glowing reviews and the rohmer pedigreebr br theres an initial and intriguing novelty to the production where rohmer essentially superimposes the actors onto painted digital backdrops of revolution era france this quickly wanes and becomes about as interesting as watching the paint dry on a paint by numbers scene what were left with is a boring and stuffy film about aristocrats in 18th century france none of the characters are appealing or sympathetic the pace is so languid the dialogue so arduous and suspense is clearly a foreign concept to rohmer that i ended up not caring whose head rolled who was harboring who or what the devil the revolution was supposed to be about the movie wouldve greatly benefited from some semblance of emotional buildup and a music score theres some fine classical music used at the very end despite being so talky the film plays much like a silent film and the worst kind of film at that a dull and uninteresting film about infinitely interesting subjects only the most astute french historians will find anything to take from this film as it dose seem to paint well known events from a new angle the lady is english and a royalist otherwise avoid this yawner at all costs unless you are suffering from insomnia i dozed off twice
2,yes the southern star features a pretty forgettable title tune sung by that heavy set crooner matt monro it pretty much establishes the tone for this bloated and rather dull feature stunningly miscast with george segal and ursula andress as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond add in harry andrews with a strange accent no less chasing an ostrich tons of stock footage of wildlife and poorly composed and dull photography by raoul coutard and you end up with a thoroughly unexciting romp through the jungles of senegal
1,when i was kid back in the 1970s a local theatre had childrens matinees every saturday and sunday afternoon anybody remember those they showed this thing one year around christmas time me and some friends went to see it i expected a cool santa claus movie what i got was a terribly dubbed you can tell and truly creepy moviebr br something about santa claus and merlin the magician dont ask me what those two are doing in the same movie fighting satan some joker in a silly devil costume complete with horns the images had me cringing in my seat i always found santa spooky to begin with so that didnt help the guy in the satan suit didnt help but what really horrified me were the wooden rein deers that pulled santas sled when he wound them up and the creepy sound they made and the movementsi remember having nightmares about those things all these years later i still remember walking out of that theatre more than a little disturbed by what i saw my friends were sort of frightened by it too i just saw an ad for it on tv and all those nightmares came roaring back this is a creepy disturbing little christmas film that will probably scare the pants off any little kid who sees it avoid this oneunless you really want to punish your kids this gets a
2,while i dont claim to be any sort of expert in marine life i must say anyone with a modicum of intelligence could not possibly buy in to this notion of a whale and not even the mother having a clue about revenge because it witnessed his dead mate having a forced abortion by humans i mean really this is basically the whole plot richard harris must have been extremely hard up for roles to have accepted this junk this is the kind of movie that is so bad that if you paid 50 cents to see it you would feel like demanding your money back
7,i have rarely been subjected to such outright nonsense in a film that is supposed to be based on a historical figure a horrible joke of a film i cringed throughout terrible trite distorted and riddled with outright lies and half truthsbr br the famous hitler biographer ian kershaw was to originally be a consultant for this film however he found the script to be so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused and also demanded they stop using his name as a source it embarrassed him to think people would think he was involvedbr br one scene shows hitler beating his dog there is not one source for this hitler loved animals above people he brought in the strictest animal welfare laws in europe banned vivisection and animal experimentation he was also a vegetarianbr br the film turns his gaining of the iron cross into a farce involving bribery utter lies he was awarded it for repeated acts of bravery over a long period of timebr br there are no historical documents showing that hitler ever had a sexual relationship with his niece not onebr br apart from these hitler is portrayed as a rabid simpleton in this garbage flickbr br if he was even half as ignorant demented and thick as he is in this nonsense film as in real life you would not even know he had ever existed never mind become the leader of germanybr br honestly this film was utterly terriblebr br go watch downfall and give this a very wide berth
5,ive seen this movie about times now and each time i view it im more impressed by the story and the acting its like watching a train wreck being set in motion its subtle in its approach but very effective in reaching its goal br br spoilers at the center of the story is a very nice dichotomy on the one hand we have deputy major eddy calhoun cusack unknowingly tearing at the old boys network that forms the hart of major of new yorks administration and on the other hand we have the mob boss zappati whos deliberately trying to maintain the status quo through all means necessary this situation nicely culminates in the end when zappati orders alselmo to make it easy on himself by killing himself and calhoun ordering pappas to do the same politically speakingbr br the movie also contains some really great oneliners such as a personal weakness of mine  you dont sum up a mans life in one moment  the only thing new in this world is the history you dont knowbr br all in all a great movie that deserves a much higher rating
0,i saw the latter half of this movie about a year ago and was very happy to finally find it available on dvd recently i watched several of the reality series on pbs about ranching etc none of them came as close to telling the story as this movie does based on real reality pulling no punches bleak happy tragic and enlightening this is a movie that should be shown to students or to anyone interested in early frontier life fine acting on the part of both rip torn and conchata ferrell add to an well done script the opening credit states that it was done though funds supplied through the national endowment for the humanities if this is the kind of product taxes could go to i would be happy to see more i highly recommend it and would encourage people to tell a friend if you have seen it and enjoyed the film
7,if youre a a fan of either or both chuck norris  judson mills then this is the movie to seeit has a lot of adventure in itit is a great follow up to presidents manthe chemistry between the main three starschuck norrisjudson millsjennifer tungis incrediblemy personal opinionthis movie along with the originalhas turned out so wellthat the networks should consider turning it into a regular seriesif youve seen presidents mani recommend this movie for youif youve seen presidents mana line in the sand but you havent seen presidents manthen let me suggest that you doyou will not be disappointed with either one
3,every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that i feel compelled to warn people if i labor all my days and i can save but one soul from watching this movie how great will be my joybr br where to begin my discussion of pain for starters there was a musical montage every five minutes there was no character development every character was a stereotype we had swearing guy fat guy who eats donuts goofy foreign guy etc the script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot the production value was so incredibly low that it felt like i was watching a junior high video presentation have the directors producers etc ever even seen a movie before halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry the concept for this movie sounded so funny how could you go wrong with gary coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors but trust me when i say this things went wrong very wrong
4,i am so upset that abc is giving up on yet another show that has the chance to be a real winner this show is so good the writing and storyline were great an actual original idea for a show instead of another boring reality show the casting was spectacular not only were the characters and actors right on but these are a very talented set of actors the concept and idea is really a new and cool idea for a tv show many of us share this whole idea of connections i really love the characters of steven laura whitney and damien but to be honest there is not one person connected to this show that i did not like even those that only were in for a few episodes sheri appleby for example the acting and characters are so easy to like and so talented i wish abc had given this show more of a chance and not interrupted the show midway also it was not advertised enough truly unfair to everyone this show showed great promise i for one will let abc know how i feel and will keep sending emails to keep this show alive please join me i know we can do it it worked for jerico by the way where is episode 13 i want that last show please support this show and send emails to abcwe can do it this show is well worth it petition online to save six degrees httpwwwpetitiononlinecomgh1215petitionhtml we can do it sign this petition asap
0,seeing moonstruck after so many years is a reminder of how sweet and sensationally funny this film was when it first appeared who knew that cher could act who had ever heard of olympia dukakis nicholas cage was the beginning of his career and vincent gardenia and danny aiello were not known for their comedic talents nor was norman jewison the directorbr br the only really flat note in this splendid work is when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie thats amore a song that is sung too many times in the movie once is already too many and that went on to have a long afterlife in popular music br br cher is  forgive me  sensational as loretta castorini a widow who wants to be married and does not have to be in love with the groom aielo johny cammareri obliges by proposing offering her his pinkie ring as a substitute for an engagement ring then rushes off to sicily to be with his dying mother he charges loretta with seeing to that his estranged brother ronny attends the wedding loretta confronts ronny and quickly falls in love with him meanwhile her father vincent gardenia is cheating on her mother olympia dukakis which loretta accidentally discovers when ronny invites her to the metropolitan operabr br everything works out in the end as it inevitably does in films of this genre in the meantime all the actors acquit themselves admirably and the audience enjoys itself in its way moonstruck is how hollywood used to be at its best rollicking entertainment with no social significance whatsoever if theyd only lost thats amore along the way it would have been perfect
7,needless remake and it cant come close to capturing the charm of the original the extreme length causes more than a few yawn inducing parts this version is ridiculously politically correct the film lacks style and mostly it lacks talent not just with the acting but the direction sets costumes etc are all below par it has a blatant disregard for period detail vanessa williams is the only cast member that shows any flair tyne daly isnt too bad they should have left well enough alone the singing ranges good vanessa williams to poor everyone else watch the original 1963 version and skip this one there is not much here to recommend
5,theres been a vogue for the past few years for oftenasnot ironic zombierelated films as well as other media incarnations of the flesh eating resurrected dead fido is a film thats either an attempt to cash in on that simply a manifestation of it or both  and it falls squarely into the category of ironic zombies the joke here is that we get to see the walking dead in the contrasting context of a broadly stereotyped squeakyclean alternatehistory we are in the wake of a great zombie war and the creatures are now being domesticated as slaves version of a 1950s suburb br br its a moderately funny concept on its own and enough perhaps for a fiveminute comedy sketch but it cant hold up a featurefilm on its own the joke that rotting corpses for servants are incongruous with this idealized version of a small town is repeated over and over again and loses all effectiveness the soundtrack relentlessly plays sunny tunes while zombies cannibalize bystanders the word zombie is constantly inserted into an otherwise familiarly homey line for a cheap attempt at a laugh br br the very broadness and artificiality of the representation of the nineteen fifties here cant help but irritate me it is so stylized in it evidently pleasantvilleinspired way that it is more apparent in waving markers of its 1950sness around than actually bearing any resemblance to anything that might have happened between 1950 and 1959 there is something obnoxiously sneering about it as if the film is bragging emptily and thoughtlessly about how more open downtoearth and superior the 2000s are br br because the characters are such broad representations of popculture 1950s types its difficult to develop much emotional investment in them each has a few character traits thrown at him or her  helen is obsessed with appearances and bill loves golf and his haunted by having had to kill his father  but they remain quite twodimensional performances within the constraints of this bad writing are fine the best is billy connolly as fido the zombie who in the tradition of boris karloff in frankenstein actually imparts character and sympathy to a lumbering green monster who cannot speak br br there are little bits of unsubtle allegory thrown around  to commodity fetishism racism classism war paranoia et cetera but none of it really works on a comprehensive level and the filmmakers dont really stick with anything br br unfortunately this film doesnt really get past sticking with the flimsy joke of look zombies in leave it to beaver for a good hour andahalf
4,i saw crispin glovers what is it at the ann arbor film festival admittedly the film was at least aptly named because i got the distinct sense that even the writerdirector could provide no answer at the question and answer session after the screening mr glover said that the film was originally meant to be a short film to show the virtue of using actors with downsyndrome however this is in itself not enough of a reason to create a film actors are in my opinion building blocks for a larger vision  a larger vision that seemed muddled at best and absent at worstbr br crispin glover also said that he wanted to address taboo subjects well he does do that but why the film seems to have no stance no reason for addressing anything does he feel these things shouldnt be taboo the film doesnt even give me an indicator of that taboo for the sake of taboo is not interesting it cant even afford to make the taboo disturbing or inciting on any level because he hasnt made the audience care in any way br br ignoring problems with the concept for a moment the thing that actually shocked me most was how poorly the film was put together the editing cinematography and other technical aspects seemed frequently to be extremely amateur glover said 125150 thousand dollars went into the movie and i feel that the money should have been spent on different designers glover actually did some design himself  i know i saw at least sound design in the credits the painted sets are okay not great but used poorly parts feel like a photographed stage play  which would be fine if that went to any sort of purpose but in glovers hands it just feels sloppy other parts are filmed like a sort of home movie of inferior quality to a lot of the stuff i see firsttime filmmakers do on imoviebr br perhaps the biggest problem with what is it is i cant even understand how seriously the film is to be taken there are some parts that feel like glover is screaming at you to think seriously at other points he seems off on his own little joke perhaps he meant for this to be ironic or meaningful in some way but i just felt that glover couldnt even get himself to give his film any sort of serious attentionbr br glover said he originally wanted it to be a short film if only it had been at seventytwo minutes the film runs out of imagery and ideas in the first twenty and it is arguable if the ideas were formulated enough to claim that they were even there for that period of time
7,there are many different versions of this one floating around so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there the cut i saw has the onscreen title witchcraft evil encounters and was released by shriek show who maintain the original us release title witchery for the dvd release its a nicelooking print and seems to have all of the footage but has some croppingaspect ratio issues in italy it was released as la casa witchcraft the first two la casa releases were actually the first two evil dead films retitled and the third la casa was another film by the same production company filmirage which is best known here in america as ghosthouse to make matters even more confusing witchery was also released elsewhere as ghosthouse except in germany where ghosthouse is actually the ogre demons ok i better just shut up now im starting to confuse myselfbr br regardless of the title this is a very hitormiss horror effort some of it is good some of it isnt i actually was into this film for the first half or so but toward the end it became a senseless mess a large vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from boston is the setting as various people get picked off onebyone by a german speaking witch hildegard knef photographer gary david hasselhoff who wants to capture witch light and his virginal writer girlfriend leslie cumming who is studying witchcraft are shacking up at the hotel without permission along comes real estate agent jerry rick farnsworth whos showing off the property to potential buyers rose annie ross and freddie robert champagne brooks also tagging along are their children pregnant grown daughter jane linda blair and very young son tommy michael manchester as well as oversexed architect linda sullivan catherine hickland  hasselhoffs wife at the time once everyone is inside their boat driver is killed hung and the boat disappears so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the lady in blackbr br so what can you expect to find here plenty of unpleasantries one of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slowroasted by the rest of the cast theres also a crucifixion witches eating a dead baby a swordfish through the head someone set on fire a possession a sesame street tape recorder the virgin getting raped by some demon a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff from a technical standpoint its a nicelooking film with pretty good cinematography a decent score and good gore effects the hotelisland setting is also pretty nice blair particularly at the end and ross both seem like theyre having fun and knef is great as the evil witch even though people like to ridicule hasselhoff these days hes not bad in his role eitherbr br on the down side despite all the gore the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour the supernatural themes are muddled and confusing too when characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy and the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber and while most of the cast is at least decent a few of the performances particularly the actress who plays hasselhoffs girlfriend and the kid are so bad theyre constantly distracting

1,star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning br br alice having defeated freddy at the end of the last film is now trying to readjust her life but her unborn child is carrying a demonous presence freddy trying to come out into their world againbr br its interesting to note the directors who got their big breaks directing freddy films charles russell eraser the mask renny harlin the long kiss goodnight cutthroat island cliffhanger die hard and here stephen hopkins lost in space predator but while russell and harlin made a good job of it hopkins imo has made something of a podge with this entry that should be quickly forgottenbr br the story is clearly being stretched as far as it can go here with freddy ludicrously a father himself and the ridiculous looking demon baby even at about an hour and a half it all gets rather tiresome and of course not scary at allbr br the bon appetit bitch catchphrase is the only memorable point of this other wise very forgettable entry 
0,this is one of the very few movies out there which are very erotic without being pornographic despite there being only a very rudimentary plot theres not much live sound or dialogue instead the actors do voiceovers describing their experience why they participated etcbr br its a documentbr br its mindblowingbr br i can totally understand why nobody else ever tried to do something like this there already is something like this this br br nb the producer doesnt have the rights to distribute a dvd version ive also never seen it being sold anywhere one may email mr boerner and order a copy on vhs
0,in recent times i have been subjected to both this movie and king arthur on dvds chosen by others for an evenings entertainment and together they achieve nothing more than bearing out a growing notion i have that the modern moviewatching public totally lacks discrimination and is content as long as they get action both movies were utter rubbishbr br whatever happened to character development whatever happened to meaningful dialogue whatever happened to acting and when watching something that vaguely purports to be historical whatever happened to attempting to capture some measure of accuracy some realistic idea of the political map of the time even some slight flavour of the era especially in its social attitudes why do they all have to display the value set of 21st century america i have read on the message boards of disclaimers that little was known of the dark ages not so considerable amounts are known with much learned scholarship on the era but these jokers simply couldnt be bothered to do any homeworkbr br i only wish i could vote 010
6,no words can describe my utter hatred for this appalling rendition of the btk killer rating this film one out of ten compliments this truly disastrous excuse for a film from start to finish there was not one single highlight the entire thing was horrendously put together the script acting plot lighting direction acting factual information acting just to name a few a number of scenes are literally laughoutloudfunny for the atrocious way in which the entire thing is put together this review may seem like an unjust and scathing attack on a lowbudget film but this is not the case just thinking about the movie i have just seen makes my blood start to boil how this film was ever granted rights for production i will never know i am almost tempted to actually recommend btk because it is truly a standout in regards to how pathetic and disturbingly awful it is i can honestly say in all my years of filmgoing this is the worst movie ever i wasted over an hour of my life on this useless garbage and would gladly have jumped off the nearest building beforehand had i known what i was in for zero out of ten

2,house of games is definitely not without its flaws plot holes stiff acting final scenes but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so methodically messes with your head house of games does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do of course this is not a huge feat given the fact that were dealing with the the world of confidence men and the cons they perpetrate so it stands to reason that we never really know whats going on even though we think that we do but thats what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessitiesbr br it has a definite hitchcock slant to it the film draws on some similar themes found his 1964 effort marnie considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the masters more thoughtprovoking works one could easily consider the idea of lindsay crouses character being the same as tippi hedrinsten year later perhaps both are strongwilled loners both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool as crouses repressed uptight character says whats life without adventure put your reality check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks
1,well where to begin i guess i can start with the general complaint regarding the way in which this film is marketed call me ignorant for not knowing of schneebaums book before viewing the documentary that has been based off of it and decide that i have been living under some kind of a rock but dont blame me for picking this movie up since the title and the description on the box makes no note of the fact that this documentary is actually a companion to said book yeah i felt quite stupid after viewing this little flick seeing as how the reason as to why i sat down to watch it in the first place was to get a good serving of a modern cannibal tale i mean am i a fool for expecting this film to actually cover most of its story on the behavior of cannibalism in jungle tribes i certainly didnt expect an hour and fortyfive minutes of one old geezer kissing his own ass by whining about every little detail of his dull and worn out life i certainly didnt expect the insipid directing and i most notably did not foresee myself laughing so hard at tobias schneebaum and all of his offputting glorybr br schneebaum is indeed unlikable the old man just rambles and bitches the entire film making the whole picture a personal tale of his even though he isnt even that interesting a character to fill a story oh really he was a cannibal ninety percent of the movie is focused on next to nothing regarding schneebaums dirty past the only time that we really get to see some cannibal action is when tobias finally breaks his little silent treatment about what happened to him in peru and say that he had a small piece thats it folks ninety minutes of bull later and tobias schneebaum is a cannibal by three inches its like calling a movie the life of a true don juan only to see that the only the time the protagonist of said film did something sexual happened during college when he once played just the tip unbelievablebr br the directing is indeed superbly ghastly as there is no flow or rhythm to the story that is being told alright i understand that i didnt read schneebaums volume before watching his celluloid tale of it but i can still recognize some bad pacing and even worse editing one minute schneebaum is talking about cruise ships and tourism and the next hes going on and on about how he cant drive and then jumps to talking about some dead relative or some failed and miserable saga in his life i mean jesus can you at least slam his back story to the first part follow up with some stuff covering his homosexuality and then end it off with a hearty look into his visit to peru also i dont particularly care much for schneebaums insipid little quips on life and living but i at least implore the old man to keep consistent with his ramblings if i hear a guy talking about how he prefers life in the jungle i dont expect him to suddenly bitch and moan about wanting to go back home twenty minutes later absurdbr br another note on the directing is the random clips from the story at hand to the small little television appearances in which our hero has appeared while some might find the clips to be fancy little breaks from the story the director has overused the gimmick and broken his entire film into pieces by seemingly attempting to place most of the efforts of telling the story on the old reelsbr br the bottom line here is that tobias schneebaum is a fraud pure and simple i know that i havent read the book but im still holding on to the argument that this film is totally useless by noting that a good film must stand on its own this documentary relies way too much on the assumption that the viewer is already an avid fan of schneebaums work and instead goes on from that assumption like a supplemental disk found on a dvd schneebaum is both arrogant and bitchy striking a sour combination when mixed with the fact that his story is remarkably unriveting if youre looking for a solid piece on the nature of humans and cannibalism turn away because keep the river to your right is an embarrassingly hilarious selfserving rant over a man who is long overdue for a straightjacket and a gag
4,this movie was so gay like its a mom and son cat that have sex they also get scared of little kitty cats they get set on fire by them the mom cat alien thing kills a guy by stabbing him in the back with an ear of corn they are bullet proof invisible and what not the star of the movie clovis is the cops cat clovis leads the cops to find the mom alien and after the mom kills the cops clovis kills the mom by eating her head then she catches on fire this movie sucks it was way way more funny than it was scary it wasnt even scaryt at all the girl hits the alien on the head with a camera it knoks him out she then goes and hugs her the then grabs her and begins to rape her once again clovis comes to the rescue
4,phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlinesbr br at first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed i didnt find the jokes or oddness funny anymorebr br its a low budget film thats never a problem in itself there were some pretty interesting characters but eventually i just lost interestbr br i imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partakingbr br for something similar but better try brother from another planet
7,an allegation of aggravated sexual assault along with some other unpleasant peccadilloes including improper use of a broom are made against half a dozen or so of the most popular highschool jocks in glen ridge new jersey by a mildly retarded student heather matarazzo the investigation and building of the case are handed over to the das office where ally sheedy and eric stoltz are put in chargebr br rumors about the case spread through glen ridge an uppermiddleclass suburb where the jocks are adored by everyone in the community one of their fathers is a police lieutenant nobody believes matarazzo our boys would never take a slut like that down to the basement rape her and subject her to such sexual humiliation the question is whether sheedy and stoltz will ever be able to shape a sufficiently cogent case that they can bring the jocks to trial matarazzo is not an ideal plaintiff shes desperate for love and friendship and that makes it easy for faux friends to mislead her into making false statements a slimy reporter says you can trust me but it turns out the reporter cant be trusted at all another student a very popular girl in school pulls a linda tripp on matarazzo pretending to be her bosom buddy but all the while asking her leading questions about the incident  and taping the results as a consequence watching this story unfold is like being on a roller coaster at first it looks like a good case for sheedy and stoltz but then oops the community organizes against the law then it looks good again but then the reporter interferes then that obstacle is no sooner overcome than linda tripp pokes her big nose into the investigation and makes public the tapes that seem to indicate matarazzo was lying well actually she was lying  but she was lying to her interrogator in order to please her then thats overcome but matarazzo objects to taking the stand because she doesnt want to be characterized as retarded eric stoltz is fine in the part of the prosecutor i say that for the simple reason that he and i lived in pago pago around the same time i hope he wasnt the kid i had that altercation with at the bar of the seaside club if he was i take back my compliment ally sheedy is a strange actress and hard to characterize she did a marvelous selfrestrained job in fine art but i didnt sense any particular effort being put into this role which was rather formulaic anyway i mean neither she nor stoltz nor anyone else could give a bravura performance in whats essentially a comic book storybr br the producers and director had the good sense to choose heather matarazzo for the role of victim the very worst thing they could have done is cast an ethereally lovely neotenous blond instead matarazzo without being at all ugly looks rather plain and this ordinary quality is complemented by her grooming and make up nor have the writers turned her wistful and gentle she has a temper and is sometimes irritating to listen to which is all for the goodbr br matarazzos character is the best drawn in the film the jocks are stereotypes pure evil they think themselves above the law barge in on some nice girls party in east orange trash the place during a party far worse than la dolce vitas climactic orgy and leave without explanation or apology they deserve to get it in the neck  and they dobr br i referred to this as a comic book story and thats pretty much what it is it challenges none of our prejudices it reaffirms out belief that the world can be divided into good and evil and we dont have a moments doubt about whos who what im waiting for  not really thats just rhetorical  is a movie almost exactly like this one and a dozen others but in which the victim is lying in order to get her name and photo in the papers and garner all those sympathy chips from rightthinking folk like the rest of usbr br the film is based on a true story as are so many others weve all seen and even more fictional features eg the accused some are good some are strictly routine okay fair enough now when do we get to see a film about the tawana brawley case in which the teenaged girl disappeared on a whim for a few days then had her friends strip her tie her up and smear her with dirt so she could claim shed been abducted and raped by the police now that would be a challenge in a way this one simply is not
0,first of all as a long time student of the titanic disaster and member of several titanic clubs i feel entitled to comment on the film i dont really care how many awards and accolades the film won but to me it is still an absolutely awful film cameron had the resources to make a proper semidocumentary film of the disaster but unfortunately chose to turn it into a pofaced romantic mush the fact that so many people around the world fell for it only shows to my mind the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days whoever said that all movies should have a hero and heroine falling in love in fact most real events are anything but romantic and the titanic disaster certainly was not one i feel that it needed a better script and director with a semidocumentary approach and as little artistic license as possible i almost threw up in the last sequence where the dead lovers meet among the other lost passengers and crew who break out in applause is this an intelligent film ask yourself
0,the central theme in this movie seems to be confusion as the relationships setting acting and social context all lead to the same place confusion even harvey keitel appears to be out of his element and lacks his usual impeccable clarity direction and intensity to make matters worse his characters name is che and we are only told directly by the narrator well into the film that he is not that che just a guy named che the family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film and once defined the family is divided  the younger generation off to america so clich other reviews discuss how the movie depicts the impact of the revolution on a boys family however the political stance of the director is murky at best and we are never quite sure who is responsible for what bloodshed so they lost their property acquired by gambling profits  so what refusing to take a political stand when making a movie about the cuban revolution is an odd and cowardly choice not to mention the movie was in english why are all these cubans speaking english no wonder they did not get permission to film in cuba and if family life is most important to look at here it would be great if we could figure out who is who  we are introduced to them all in the beginning  a cheap way out of making the relationships clear throughout the film the acting was mostly shallow wooden and unbelievable timing was off all around the special visual effects were confusing and distracting references to american films  and the black character as greek chorus  strictly gratuitous intellectually ostentatious and consistently out of place i only watched the whole movie because i was waiting for clarity or some point to it all it never happened
6,simon pegg stars as sidney young a stereotypically clumsy idiot brit working as a celebrity journalist in this us comedy after getting a very lucky break he starts work at the highly respected sharps magazine run by a reliably on form jeff bridges in new york its more the devil wears prada than shaun of the dead the unlikely love interest is provided by kirsten dunst who works well with pegg for the laughs but they dont exactly set the screen ablaze with their passionbr br sidney goes through some emotional challenges while trying to decide if he should forget about his journalistic principles in order to get material in the magazine of course hes eventually seduced by the glitz and glamour of the world of celebrities especially the young starlet sophie maes transformers megan fox fans of shaun of the dead hot fuzz and spaced will wonder if pegg himself ever experienced similar feelings in real life with this film and to an extent run fat boy run as one of the uks best comic talents being ruined by the usbr br all in all this is a forgettable comedy please come back to us simon we can forgive and forget
7,to summarize this movie without a real plot this movie consists of 80 minutes of deranged characters either drinking or making bad jokes the music is just awful the humor isnt funny and all the female characters slutty idiots or total geeks it seems to me that the movie has actually been written by a 14 year old boy who thinks that drinking is cool women are designed to please men and all that oppose that view are geeks also the movie has nothing to do with the original american pie movies other than a few names and mr levenstein who is a minor character in this one the only good thing about this movie are the nice looking girls dont watch this movie and dont be fooled by the 54 rating because it obviously overrated and doesnt deserve anything above
5,while i would say i enjoy the show i expected something completely different from when i first saw what i like about you i expected to find something along the lines of all that i am not sure if it is going on anymore but i have to say i do like the show and while i dont classify it as a breakthrough show it is very charming and i do like the chemistry between the characters as well including the supporting castbr br i would definitely say that it is great to see wesley jonathan back on the screen because i really loved him in city guy i had also seen the woman who plays valeries friend in popular and while i think that was an okay show i do not really like her character in this show because shes just not my cup of tea but she rounds it out pretty well
2,nothing is fantastic simple as that its a film that shouldnt work yet does natali stays in the realm of scifi however this film is also a comedy cypher it seemed was a big budget draining affair for natali at 75million woohoo pa so with nothing he scales down again this is low budget independent filmmaking at its best simple good old fashioned storytelling and an attempt at making a film for artistic merit as apposed to hollywoods usual reasons for mostly financial gain nothing is a film about nothing and before you ask no it is not anything like seinfeld basically andrew and dave are a couple of losers they live in a strange looking house beneath two freeways andrew is a telesales travel agent who is agoraphobic while dave is andrews best mate who stays with him rent free to help him out dave is tired of it however and has a gorgeous girlfriend who he wants to move in with by bizarre misfortunes however dave finds out his girlfriend embezzled a huge amount of money from daves workplace incriminating dave and andrew is wrongly accused of sexually assaulting a girl scout canadian humour people as it turns out andrews house is to be demolished as well and he cant stop it happening as the house was built on land it should not have been built on both andrew and dave are inside the house when the police and the demolition team come calling they are desperate and cant escape and in the panic and confusion just as the police burst in everything fades to white what has happened have dave and andrew died they wake to find themselves still in the house only it is quiet no police no demolition team no angry girl scout mother what happens is dave and andy discover they have the ability to wish or hate away as it turns out they have hated away the entire outside world they are left alone the house is surrounded by nothing which is portrayed as pure white so what this means is that the films setting is a house set and then just white the film is an interesting view on human isolation and the psyche and of course as they spend more time alone together with no food and no water they begin to tire of each other they discover they can hate away hunger which is useful but obviously things get out of hand shall we say i cant reveal much but i must say bouncing heads are quite a sight to beholdbr br this film is quirky funny interesting the effects are simple yet effective and natali brings together two buddies from cube david hewlett and andrew millar to lead the film they have chemistry and also work very well they have to hold 90 of the movie by themselves and much of it in a pure white background yet it works certainly i expect this to get the same diabolical treatment as cypher did and it should appear on dvd in a year or two in the states nothing is a top quality and unique film and although not as good as cube or cypher it once again proves natali as one of the best up and comersbr br natali is someone who has really interested me in his three features so far and i cannot wait for his next feature i prey to god he doesnt do the proposed necropolis written and directed by add sufferer the ever crap paul anderson vincenzo old buddy if paul comes round to your pad run run like the wind i hope and prey this guy doesnt take to hollywood like alex proyas did with the enjoyable yet pussyfooted sugar coated helium light i robot keep your eyes peeled for this guy 
0,there is a reason why jay leno himself will not acknowledge this film it consistently ranks as one of the worst films of all time the acting is horrible the script lacks direction and the director himself doesnt seem sure on which way to take this film a buddy film an actioncomedy mystery seems half way through he gives up and is just along for the ride jay leno and pat morita are talented and dedicated performers it is a shame that they wasted their time and gifts making this mess of a movie jay leno and pat morita prior to involving themselves with this had spent years pounding out their crafts on the hollywood circuit mr morita had already been a star in his own right acting steadily since the mid 1960s as the star of such cult tv and movie classics as happy days and the dismal but affable mr t and tina and won the hearts of america with his roles in the powerful film midway the karate kid and a host of others mr leno can been seen on tv shows dating back to the mid 70s and was a top performer in the comedy clubs of america he can be seen in countless tv spots and in major films it is a shame that they agreed to be seen with this nonsense

1,i first caught the movie on its first run on hbo in probably 1981 and being 15 years old i thought the movie was hilarious i remember not seeing the alfred e neuman depictions shown in the theatrical trailers when mad magazine satired the movie and abruptly halted half way through with apologies from the usual gang for lowering themselves to satire such a piece of crap i just assumed they were poking fun at themselves which im sure they were but to seriously find them  and ron liebman  so embarrassed to remove their names from any credits i was quite surprised surely there are many worse movies to be associated with watching the movie on video now at age 32 with the mad references restored i still get a kick out of it and being a ron liebman fan hot rock wheres poppa i think its his crown jewel of performances say it agaaaain
1,with a tendency to repeat himself wenders has been a consistent disappointment ever since he hit it big with paris texasbr br land of plenty is no exception taking into the fact that i anticipated an averagemediocre film even before i went in wenders ambitions seem to always get the better of him its taken for grated now his films are heavyhanded and bombasticbr br i werent sure if i was watching a comedy that mocks middle america or some thriller the outcome of diehls character is wholly predicable wenders insistence on layering many many scenes with some rock song is also intensely annoying he was covering up the holes in his script and direction by jazzing up the scenesbr br i am certain that many people will find this film important and resonant but in all honestly this clumsy and didactic effort only speaks of poor directionbr br interesting that wenders professed that while making paris texas he had great help from sam sheppard with the script yes that was wenders best and he should understand now he needs a good scriptwriter his films from the past 15 years were a total mess
4,the significance of french title of this film la naissance des pieuvres which literally means the birth of the octopuses is rather obscure so it is perhaps not surprising that it has been marketed in englishspeaking countries as water lilies the lilies of the english title are three teenage girls marie anne and floriane who are members of a synchronised swimming team based in the paris suburbs and the film is a comingofage drama about the development of their first sexual feelingsbr br one feature of the film perhaps unusual for a film of this type is that it concentrates exclusively on relationships between the young people themselves we see nothing of their parents or their teachers and very little of the adult world at all the three girls are very different in appearance and are portrayed as being very different in character the shy retiring marie is slim and petite and appears to be the youngest of the three anne is something of a plain jane floriane a glamorous blonde who is very popular with the boys the three together with a handsome male swimmer named francois are involved in what might be described as a lovequadrilateralbr br anne has fallen in love with francois but he is smitten with floriane who seems to return his affections although he is by no means her only male admirer indeed not all of florianes admirers are male because marie has a crush on her attractive friend the film charts the way in which their friendship develops at first it seems that floriane is simply using marie as a convenient excuse when she is in fact going out to meet boys her parents presumably object to her dating boys but have no objection to her going out with female friends later however we realise that despite florianes image as the sexy popular girl who is always the centre of male attention she actually reciprocates maries feelings the film reverses some conventional stereotypes about sexuality anne with her short hair and rather chunky figure looks typically butch yet she is the only one of the three main characters who is unambiguously heterosexual whereas the more conventionally feminine marie and the glamorous floriane are lesbian or at least bisexualbr br comingofage films are common enough although most of them tend to avoid the controversial topic of teenage lesbianism water lilies however deals with its subjectmatter in a sensitive way with three very good performances from its three leading actresses pauline acquart adele haenel and louise blachere the relationships between the characters especially that between marie and floriane are complex and capable of a number of interpretations is floriane for example simply using marie for sex or does she genuinely have romantic feelings for her could florianes sluttish behaviour with francois and the other boys be just a device to hide her lesbian feelings from the outside world or even to hide them from herself this was the first film made by its young director celine sciamma only 27 at the time on this basis she must be regarded as a highly promising newcomer 710
2,the film transported everyone back to october 20 1944 where we seemed to be part of the great philippine i shall return landing scene it was on that leyte shore where general macarthur reaped his fame br br above all gregory peck triumphed in his portrayal of the great general it is the stride the set of the shoulders the intensity its what both men have had in common intensity total absorption devotion with macarthur it was for the military with peck it was for the challenge of acting an academy award winner for to kill a mockinbird an oscar nominee for keys to the kingdom the yearling gentlemans agreement and twelve oclock highhe has played everything from an apparently homicidal amnesiac to a crusading journalist from a troubled gunfighter to an obsessed attorney from biblical david to captain horatio hornblower he has brought to them all his own unique insight his character his sincerity warmth and love and especially his humor br br there is a scene where macarthur stands on deck with the president of the philippines we can hear the dialogue general i hope the water isnt too deep says the president because my people will find out i cant swim then come pecks sonorous voice and my people are going to find that i cant walk on water br br as macarthur peck once again justified his reputation as a giant in the film industry through him we felt macarthurs emotions we knew his anger his happiness and we understood the relationship with his whole family
4,this film is exactly what its title describesan attempt to get you to buy into what the writers have to offerbr br first its kinda fun to see the 1996style toronto i remember with all its silly haircuts sunglasses clothes and attitude it really hasnt changed any just a nice safe cheap provincial little urban backwater that makes a great meeting place for international film types its also amusing to see kenny and spenny head to la and find out that its toronto all over again only with a strange assortment of beach bums musicians fortune tellers and yet more uppity film typesbr br i dont see pitch as a film to be enjoyed its not entertainment unless the viewer enjoys watching someones aspirations being trampled i take pitch as a warning that power and money is really held by studio execs and production houses wouldbe and successful writers musicians and actors are still mere transients even when they reach the big timebr br so kenny and spenny are trying to sell you a warning buy it or dont but the message is still there
2,the lives of the saints starts off with an atmospheric vision of london as a bustling city of busy quaint streets and sunshine i was hoping it would maintain this atmosphere but it gets bogged down in a story that goes pretty much nowherebr br othello works for big fat mr karva his crimeboss stepdad at least i think that is what he is supposed to be because its never really defined but he does drop kittens into deep fat friers so trust me hes a prick doing scrappy little errands while his skanky girlfriend gives daddy handjobs one of his colleagues is runner a black dude who is always dashing from a to b until the day he comes across almost mute homeless child who grants him his wish of being able to stop running runner dumps the lost boy in othellos flat where he promptly starts granting more wishes keen to have some of his own desires fulfilled karva has the boy kidnapped but he isnt sure of what would really bring him happiness is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another handjob either way i dont want to see the little boy grant him the secondbr br it just takes ages to get going and there are loads of repetitive scenes the ending tries to be shocking but since theres hardly any backstory on investment in any of these characters it only serves as a release for the bored audiencebr br writer tony grisoni a favourite of terry gilliam tries to blend in some kind of religious allegory which ends up being pretentious as all hell ironically if he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters suddenly acting all weird then it would have been a more enjoyable film as it is we are introduced to a bunch of annoying loudmouths who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy whos origins are never revealed thats just plain irritating br br aside from sporadic moments of atmosphere and a moody score this film has little to recommend
5,ok i dont really think that trailer park boys has bad story lines because they kick ass they just conflict with each otherbr br for example near the end of the movie it shows ricky and julian telling patrick lewis to put the dog down and walk away then at the end it shows ricky and julian saying that theyve been in jail for years in the tv series pilot the first clip they show is the same clip of ricky and julian yelling at patrick lewis but in the tv series theyve supposedly only been in jail for 18 monthsbr br also they give us the impression that the movies story line and the tv series story line are connected because of the yelling scene between the guys but some actors portray totally different characters of course patrick roach plays patrick lewis in the movie but in the series he plays randy sam tarasco plays one of the guys who pays ricky for an extermination and then he plays sam losco in the seriesbr br also again i know i have a lot to say in the movie the guys snort coke instead of smoking hash the thing is they never actually confirm that the two story lines are connected in anyway other than the yelling scenebr br sorry to keep on blabbing
0,this film is a quite entertaining horror anthology film along the lines of tales from the crypt written by robert bloch author of psycho its good fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast the movie should also be required viewing for doctor who fans since jon pertwee the third doctor has an amusing role as a rude and obnoxious horror star
7,i saw this film at a prerelease screening at the writers guild theater in beverly hills as i recall the films producers and director were in attendance presumably to gage our reactionbr br many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience which would have been fine if it had been a comedy but it was supposed to be a horror filmbr br if the audience wasnt scared it seems the filmmakers were they delayed release for over a year out of curiosity i saw it again to see if theyd recut it as far as i can tell they hadnt it was the same lousy movie just a year olderbr br it almost qualifies as so bad its good but its slowpaced and boring
0,cypher is a clever effective and eerie film that delivers its good premise is presented well and it has its content delivered in an effective manner but also in a way the genre demands although one could immediately label the film a science fiction there is a little more to it it has its obvious science fiction traits but the film resembles more of a noirdetective feel than anything else which really adds to the storybr br the film overall plays out like its some kind of nightmare thus building and retaining a good atmosphere were never sure of what exactly is going on were never certain why certain things that are happening actually are and were not entirely sure of certain people similar to having a dream  the ambiguity reigns over us all  hero included and i havent seen this pulled off in such a manner in a film before bar terry gilliams brazil going with the eeriness stated earlier cypher presents itself with elements of horror as well as detective noir and science fiction giving the feeling that theres something in there for everyone and it integrates its elements wellbr br there is also an espionage feeling to the film that aids the detective side of the story the mystery surrounding just about everyone is disturbing to say the least and i find the fact that the character of rita foster liu who is supposed to resemble a femme fatale can be seen as less of a threat to that of everything else happening around the hero people whom appear as friends actually arent people who say theyre helping are actually using and those that appear harmless enough are actually deadlier than they look despite a lot of switching things around twisting the plot several times and following orders that are put across in a way to make them seem that the world will end if theyre not carried out the one thing that seems the most dangerous is any romantic link or connection with lucy lius character  and shes trying to help out the film maintains that feeling of two sides battling a war of espionage spying and keeping one up on its employees and opponents the whole thing plays out like some sort of minicold war something that resembles the usa and the ussr in their war of words heyday and it really pulls through given the black bleak often cgi littered screen that i was glued to br br what was also rather interesting and was a nice added touch was the travel insert shot of certain american states made to resemble computer microchips as our hero flies to and from his stated destinations  significant then how the more he acts on his and fosters own motivation this sequence disappears because hes breaking away from the computerised repetitive controlled life that hes being told to live and is branching outbr br cyhper is very consistent in its content and has all the elements of a good film to say it resembles the first jason bourne film only set in the scifi genre isnt cutting it enough slack but you can see the similarities despite them both being released in the same year like i mentioned earlier there feels like there is something in this film for everyone and if you can look past the rather disappointing ending that a few people may successfully predict you will find yourself enjoying this film
6,this movie is essentially shot on a hand held camera by the actors in it in some ways a mockumentary in other ways a video diary from killers it is full on account of a columbine style attack while this movie does not answer all the big questions it does give you an insight into how easy it would be to get away with through the movie you are shown how the actors illegally shortened shot guns made pipe bombs and came up with an action plan for zero day the actors if you can call them that were brilliant they obviously borrowed heavily from there own lives but at no stage did i detect them really acting something tom cruise should try the use of the cctv and the 911 operator at the end was genius but im not sure if we needed the very last scene overall though a really good movie on a very tough topic
7,having read many of the other reviews for this film on the imdb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based upon this point i cannot comment having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously however what i can say with certainty is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass lets be honest here  this film is just so much funbr br okso i must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the characters but lets put this into a clear perspectivedo the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic 1960s batman series does not remain faithful to the original dc comic book character or perhaps is there still unrest in same persons that the 1980 film version of flash gordon was too much of a departure from the original seriesbr br the point is yes this film is incredibly camp but thats precisely its charmbr br former tarzan ron ely plays the eponymous hero in this and bears more than a passing resemblance to gary busey to boot and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite michael berrymanbr br best scene far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke lemonade and milk at a formal occasion also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein savage tackles his nemesis captain seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen  pricelessbr br simply put the film doesnt take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it great fun from start to finish and youll be singing the john phillip sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed
4,the show is average it doesnt make me laugh particularly however i think courtney really brings it down she doesnt look natural she has these three ways to talk all robotic she talks quietly with no intonation she talks normally with no intonation or she does that thing where she starts talking normally and starts yelling gradually however her yelling is like lets pretend im yelling because i shouldnt be too loud on the set br br she is constantly aware of herself being this cute actress doing this funny thing its annoying you cant really get her personality because she doesnt really produce emotion and doesnt get upset she has this husband whos doing all these stupid things and there is no reaction from her very dry and plain acting
0,the concept of this madefortv horror movie is ludicrous beyond words but hey it was the late 1970s and literally all stupid horror formats were pretty damn profitable so why not exploit the idea of a satanically possessed dog the plot of devil dog is easy to describe to fans of the horror genre simply think of the omen and replace the newborn baby boy with a nest of german shepard pups seriously im not kidding thats what the movie is about during the opening sequence members of some kind of satanic cult buy a female dog in heat only to have it impregnated by satan himself youd think that the lord of darkness has other things on his mind than to fornicate with a german shepard and take over the world one evil puppy at the time but apparently not exactly like little damien in the omen one of the puppies is taken in by model family and grows up to become a beautiful and charismatic animal but lucky  thats the dogs name  is pure evil and liquidates annoying neighbors and nosy school teachers in derivative and tamely executed ways he also inflicts his malignant character on the family wife and children but he cannot force the father richard crenna to stick his arm into a lawnmower because hes a chosen one the whole thing becomes too moronic for words when crenna eventually travels to ecuador to search for an ancient wall painting and gets advice from an old witchdoctor who speaks perfect english i guess he learned that living in isolation atop of a mountain his entire life director curtis harrington whats the matter with helen ruby and lead actor richard crenna wait until dark the evil desperately try to create a suspenseful and mysterious atmosphere but all is in vain scenes like cute puppy eyes spontaneously setting fire to a spanish maid or a dog dodging bullets without even moving evoke chuckles instead of frights and not even spooky musical tunes can chance that the special effects are pathetic especially near the end when the satandog mutates into an utterly cheesy shadow on the wall devil dog is a truly dumb movie but its definitely hilarious to watch late at night with some friends and loads of liquor there are entertaining brief cameos of martine beswick dr jekyll and sister hyde as the terrifying cult queen and rg armstrong the car the pack as the evil fruit vegetable and puppy salesman and yes that annoying daughter is the same kid who gets blown away complaining about her icecream in carpenters assault on precinct 13
2,grey gardens is a world unto itself edith and little edie live in near total isolation eating ice cream and liver pate in a makeshift kitchen in their apparently shared bedroom cats loll about while mother edith insults her daughters elocution this is a tennessee williams play come to life and should inspire screenwriters and playwrights as the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100 realbr br the situation in the house reminds me exactly of how my grandmother and her 50ish daughter lived for a decade other than that they were poor and clean they would bicker all day grandmother talking about her gloriously perfect past while her daughter continually blamed her for missed opportunities with men work and selfexpressionbr br this film is a mustsee for anyone writing a motherdaughter relationship of this kind it is sad and voyeuristic but the filmmakers did an amazing job getting the edies comfortable enough to expose themselves so recklessly it is rare to see true life this way and all the more special considering the contextremnants of a powerful family fading into nothingness in the skeleton of their own mansion
0,dr mordrid is terrifying i would not recommend any adult or child see this unless they are rampaging murderers already there is so much filth in this movie it hurts my yes speaking of eyes there are eyes in the sky against a backdrop of stars only the devil himself could have imagined such a wicked thing i rented out every copy i could from local video stores and crushed them with a pound crucifix that movie should remain locked in a cellar behind the 4th dimension with all the other disgusting beasts of hell that is where this movie belongs i suggest if you want some scandalous entertainment go and rent all dogs go to heaven or angels in the outfield those movies are worth seeing if you want to commit a sin and love terrible movies you need to see dr mordrid
1,i watched this movie purely for the setting it was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of the plot was predictable the acting was mediorcre at best the scares were all grossouts not true scaresbr br i dont remember much of the plot and i think thats because there wasnt much of one to remember they didnt even use the hotel to its fullest potentialthe beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula at low tide you can walk almost 14 mile into the bay which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracksbr br the best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action and im using that term looslyscenes and pause at the beauty of the surroundings
4,annies wig does not look good she is not cute and pretty enough to play annie annie sticks out in the movie as her outfits look like halloween costumes terrible acting and terrible plots this movie is such a change from the 1982 version i think that a younger and smaller girl should have had the lead role ashley johnson portrays a very boyish annie not appealing at all at least the casting director got it right with daddy warbucks ms hannigan was also miscast camilla belle played molly alright warning this movie might insult your iq so you might just want to only show it to very young children and younger some of the plots are too fictional and could hardly take place in the real world
0,id like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest crappiest movie ive ever seenbr br i have no idea whats wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings the only thing i can imagine is that people mustve voted during one or more conditionsbr br while being shitfaced  stoned out of their minds theyve received hard cash for the votes under gunpointbr br i cant believe i wasted a good h 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie
6,i have never read the booka wrinkle in time to be perfectly honesty after seeing the movie do i really want to well i shouldnt be reviewing this movie ill start off with that next ill say that the tv movie is pretty forgettable do you know why i say that because i forgot what happens in it i told you it was forgettable to be perfectly honest no tv movie will ever be better than merlinbr br how do i describe a tv movie i have never written a review for one before well ill just say that they usually have some celebrities a wrinkle in time includes only one alfre woodardor woodward i am not sure the oscar winner br br the film has cheesy special effects a mildly interesting plot scenes that make you go wtf the movie is incredibly bad and it makes you gowtf what did i expect its a tv movie they usually arent good as is this one a wrinkle in time is a waste of time and a big time waster to top it off youll most likely forget about it the second its over well maybe not the second its over but within a few minutesbr br a wrinkle in time
7,this movie is amazing while being funny and entertaining it is also profoundly deep and eyeopening i will watch it again and again bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life he has a job and a life but it isnt what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness bruce is bitter unsatisfied and resentful that his life isnt the way he envisions it should be as a result of this state of mind bruce ends up losing his job and blaming god for everything that he thinks is wrong with his life god comes to bruce and grants him godly powers bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted his life is finally exactly what he envisioned it would take to make him happywith one exception in the process of gaining everything he loses the one person who truly loved him as the movie unfolds bruce learns that the real change that needed to occur in his life was not the circumstances but his perception of what was truly there this movie was inspirational and deep if you really pay attention it forces you to look at your life with a deeply humbling respect for the fact that a lot of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize as my wife says since when does anybody know what it takes to make them happy and my humble addition may we not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out
1,the good thing about this thats at least fresh almost no movies about dance music and the club scene if even made hit the cinemas and it radiates lots of energy too from the music to the portrayal of ibizabr br but the main problem is that it cant decide what it wants to be although it definitely likes to be a mockumentary in the line of this is spinal tap the makers also realized they wouldnt want to play copycat however it fails grossly on the jokes because its not very well written and most characters are underdeveloped and it has no arc in its script and directing to make it to 90 minutes so why not edit it down to 75 the production department and cinematography still try to save the day eg pauls homebr br in a strange way and unexpectedly so its all gone pete tong works much better as a simple drama in the line of almost famous especially the scenes with beatriz batarda offer some acting powerbr br conclusion its a mess it somewhat entertains at a basic level but you better spend a night in your favorite club
0,another comment about this film made it sound lousy given talking pictures were so new  i think the script and acting were good davis was so young and fresh she had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect yet it is great to see her this way  still learning the craftbr br so many clichs came from this film and it seems this film blazed some trails for the next 70 years my vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight i love it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenced by others negative and one note comments
1,berlinborn in 1942 margarethe von trotta was an actress and now she is a very important director and writer she has been described perhaps even unfairly caricatured as a director whose commitment to bringing a womans sensibility to the screen outweighs her artistic strengths rosenstrasse which has garnered mixed and even strange reviews the new york times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews ive ever read in that paper is not a perfect film it is a fine movie and a testament to a rare coalescing of successful opposition to the genocidal nazi regime by of all peoples generically powerless germans demonstrating in a berlin streetbr br cowriter von trotta uses the actual rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young womans search for information about her mothers never disclosed life as a child in the german capital during world war iibr br the husband of ruth weinstein jutta lampe has died and in a surprising reversion to an orthodox jewish lifestyle apparently hitherto in long abeyance ruth not only sits shivah the jews weeklong mourning ritual but she insists on following the strict proscriptions of her faith her apartment in new york city reflects the affluence secured by her deceased spouses labors her americanborn daughter hannah maria schrader and her brother are a bit putoff by moms assumption of restrictive orthodox jewish practices but they pitch in the mother coldly rejects the presence of hannahs fiance a nonjew named luis fedja van huet a domestic crisis might well erupt as ruth warns that shell disown hannah if she doesnt give up doting handsome luis stay tunedbr br a cousin arrives to pay her respects and also drops clues to an interested hannah about a wartime mystery about moms childhood in berlin hannah is intrigued  she queries her mom who resolutely refuses to discuss that part of her life this is very very realistic i grew up with parents who fled nazi germany just in time and i knew many children whose families in whole but usually in part escaped the holocaust those days were simply not discussedbr br so hannah having learned that a german gentile woman saved ruths life traipses off to berlin hoping to find the savior still breathing were she not this would have been a very short film but ruth pretending to be a historian locates 90 yearold lena fischer doris schade now a widow as the happytobeinterviewed but shaken up by repressed memories lena tells her story the scenes shift fairly seamlessly between present day berlin and the wartime capitalbr br the young lena of 1943 katja riemann was a fine pianist married to a jewish violinist fabian fischer martin feifel with the advent of the nazi regime he was required to use israel as a middle name just as jewish women had to add sarah to their namesincidentally i wish imdb had not given fabians name on its characters list with the false israel includedit simply perpetuates a name applied by nazis as a mark of classification and degradationbr br while germany deported most of its jewish population to concentration camps those married to aryans were exempted for a time until 1943 when the regime decided to take them too most were men a minority were jewish women married to nonjews the roundup is shown here in all its frightening intensitybr br the young lena tries to locate her husband all she and many other women know is that theyre confined in a building on rosenstrasse the crowd of anxious women builds up some piteously seeking help from german officers who predictably refuse aid and also verbally abuse them jewloving whore being one appellation as a subplot lena more or less adopts eightyearold ruth who hid when her mother was seized remember ruth is now sitting shiva in manhattan the child ruth is fetchingly portrayed by svea lohde br br through increasingly angry protestations the women finally prevail the men and a handful of women are released as in the real story the nazis gave in one of the rare almost unprecedented times when the madmen acknowledged defeat in their homicidal agenda another was the termination of the euthanasia campaign to rid the reich of mental defectives and chronic invalids but thats another storybr br von trotta builds up the tension and each womans story is both personal and universal hannah continues to prod the aging lena who slowly one gathers begins to suspect shes not dealing with an ordinary historian but rather someone with a need to learn about the girl she rescued the child whose mother was murderedbr br the contrasts between rosenstrasse of 1943 a set and the street today in a bustling rebuilt unified berlin provide a recurring thematic element todays berlin bears the heritage but not the scars of a monstrous past von trotta makes that point very wellbr br the main actors are uniformly impressive lenas husband while strong is also shown as totally helpless in the snare of confinement with a likely outlook of deportation which is shown to have been clearly understood by all characters  including the local police and military  as a oneway trip to oblivion the older ruth is catalytically forced to confront demons long suppressed in her happy new york life hannah is very believable as a young woman whose fathers death triggers a need to discover her familys past these things happen although the timess critic appears not to know thatbr br von trottas hand is sure but not perfect a scene with goebbels at a soiree enjoying lenas violin playing is unnecessary and distractive the suggestion that she may have gone to bed with the propaganda minister the most fanatical toplevel hitler worshiper to save her husband detracts from the wondrous accomplishment of the demonstrating spouses and relatives most of the german officers come from central casting and are molded by the erich von stroheim copy and paste school of teutonic nastiness but thats understandablebr br the rosenstrasse story has been the subject of books and articles and some claim its a paradigm case for arguing that many more jews could have been saved had more germans protested unfortunately that argument is nonsense the german women who occupied rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably selfinterested most germans were located on a line somewhere between passive and virulent antisemitism thats why the rosenstrasse protest was virtually singular whether one buys or rejects the goldenhagen thesis that most germans were willing accomplices of the actual murderers it just can not be denied that prenazi endemic antisemitism erupted into a virulent strain from 1933 onbr br the elderly lena remarks that what was accomplished by the women was a ray of light in an evil time most of the men and women sprung from a near death trip survived the war so a ray of light it was and von trottas movie is a beacon of illumination showing that some were saved by the courage of largely ordinary women and for every life saved an occasion for celebration exists and always willbr br 910
5,i also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago first im going to say that it looks great cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinematographer i just wish the movie had been as good as it looks i would not call this a horror movie putting in a few shots of a decaying ghost does not make it a horror movie theres no mystery theres no suspense you know who did it the entire time br br its a drama you know whats going on with both sides the entire movie the acting was okay i guess but nothing specialbr br and the tagline revenge can be deadlyreallythey should have check how many hundreds of horrorthriller movies have that exact same taglinebr br it pains me to say some of this but i know a lot of the people who worked on this movie and i know they dont want people blowing smoke up their ass so i give my honest opinion
6,i was hardly aware of the time in history depicted in this 1971 brazilian black comedy however that is not to say it wasnt accessible to me because the movie makes it very clear its set in 16th century brazil where rival french and portuguese settlers are exploiting the indigineous people as confederates in their battle to assert dominance what is particularly interesting about the movie is that it is made by the portuguese from the point of view of the french the hero is a likable frenchman the portuguese are barbarians and the rest of the french are oppressive and greedy the films portuguese makers are objective because when all is said and done we see that it makes no difference whose side one takes its about heredity overpowered by environment in a time starkly defined by tribes enemies are made and perpetuated and like so the environmental integration never progressesbr br a frenchman is captured by the portuguese is then captured by an indigenous tribe the tupinambas after they massacre a group of portuguese the tribes shaman predicted they would find a strong portuguese man to cannibalize as revenge for the chiefs brother being killed by a portugeuse musket ball thinking the frenchman is portuguese they believe they now have one nevertheless the frenchman is granted unrestrained course of the village is sooner or later given a wife and assumes their accustomed appearance rather than his western clothes or any clothes another frenchman comes to the village and tells the tribe that their prisoner is indeed portuguese then assures the incensed frenchman that he will tell them the truth when the frenchman finds a secret treasure trove that another european has hidden nearbybr br i found the opening scene funny because its narration apposed with its contradictions on screen serve as great satire even if the movie didnt seem to want to maintain that tone very much more often its actually not a terribly riveting film the bountiful essential locale fierce way of life and ripened native women make not only the frenchman but us too forget any threat and we have the feeling of him as a free man it should not be that terribly hard to escape the cannibalism is as scarce of desire as the fullfrontal nudity of the cast suggested in lieu as the representative core of pereira dos santoss dry political cartoon of new world mythology and undeveloped social coherence at any rate this 1500sera social commentary shot on location at a bay with 365 islands played almost entirely nude and almost entirely written in tupi encourages effective breakdown of established ways which are topical because theyve repeated themselves for centuries
0,i wasnt terribly impressed with dantes 1st season offering in homecoming it wasnt much of a horror story but rather a smart political statement with the undead screwfly situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes mens sexual drive to replaced with murderous tendencies toward women the episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home i assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak but is unclear because this is never revisited the episode go ons for a while introducing characters blah blah blahit seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars to get worse and worse as it lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfying end the worst episode well except for chocolate
5,this film is a huge steaming pile br br i have no idea why anyone felt that the garlandmason version needed to be redone nor why striesand would have been a first choice to starbr br for that matter i have no idea why our people gay americans tend largely to regard striesand as some kind of treasure at least in my opinion she had peaked professionally with with funny girl and bogdanovichs whats up doc br br do yourself a favor and rent the judy classic or even the original a fine film in its own right but please please please skip this stinkpot
0,well as goethe once said there really isnt any point in trying to pass a negative judgement that aspires to be objective on something that has had a great effect la maman et la putain has surely passed into history as an influence on much of whats been done in france and elsewhere in the past thirty years and no one interested in the history of film certainly should be dissuaded from watching it to express a purely subjective judgement however i feel compelled to disagree with almost every other review posted here and say to people dont watch it its a waste of hours of your time that will just leave you feeling rather sick and angry and by that i dont mean sick and angry about the human condition or anything so general and profound as that because that is exactly the line that most critics have adopted in their fulsome praise of the film  an ordeal to watch in its ruthless dissection of our emotional cowardice and cruelty and so on  and if it really managed to put across a universally or even broadly relevant message of this sort then the director would have good reason to be satisfied with himself however pessimistic his conclusions may be my beef with the film is rather that i dont see this hourslong record of empty vanity and petty treachery as being justified or excused by any generally relevant message at all all three main characters are deeply morally unattractive individuals alexandre to the greatest degree of course because we see by far the most of him and because he seldom shuts up for more than thirty seconds marie perhaps to the least degree because we see the least of her alexandres affected and pretentious monologues have a kind of amusement value of course but the amusement wears thin as one comes more and more clearly to realize that jeanpierre laud is most likely not even acting and that with absurd remarks like un homme beau comme un film de nicholas ray he really was just reproducing wordforword opinions that were accepted as authentic and profound by the milieu in which he along with the director eustache had been living for about ten years by the time of the making of the film i suppose if the tone of relentless superficiality and triviality had been sustained throughout 100 of the film it might have worked as a long sardonic comedy about a particularly shallow worthless and despicable post68 milieu what made however this viewer at least extremely angry with the director was his granting of at least one lengthy scene each to alexandre and veronika in which we are clearly expected to empathize with and feel for them as if they shared a moral universe with us if a man can get away with living in the flat of and professing to love one woman sleeping mostly in this very flat with another and running around paris proposing marriage to yet a third well i suppose i can wish him the best of luck in the dogeatdog world hes chosen to create for himself what i cant however in all conscience do is listen even for a moment to maudlin monologues from him in which he speaks about his anxiety and his despair the same goes double for the even more despicable veronika whom we are shown barging drunk into the apartment and even the bed shared by marie and alexandre and behaving there with an infantile inconsistency tantamount to the most savage and heartless cruelty as i say if la maman et la putain is intended to be nothing more nor other than a portrait of alexandre veronika and marie three individuals whom any even halfway decent person would never admit into their company let alone their home then i suppose there is a kind of legitimacy in praising the director for being unflinching though why one should even feel like flinching once one had consciously opted to create such thoroughly repellent characters to filmically observe i cant imagine the problem however is that the director is clearly convinced  and appears to have succeeded in convincing generations of critics  that alexander veronika and marie are somehow representative of human beings in general and of the limits of human beings emotional capabilities this latter idea however is arrant and offensive nonsense there may indeed be an inherent fallibility and tendency to tragedy in human relations in general and sexual relations in particular but the nature and degree of this fallibility and tendency to tragedy can only possibly be determined by people who make a sincere and serious effort to make such relations work it surely needs no cinematic or authorial genius to convey to us the information that a man who behaves like alexandre is going to end up hated miserable and alone or that women who insist on expecting love from a man like alexandre are going to end up disappointed and bitter watch la maman et la putain if youre historically interested in what passed for culture and human interaction in a certain post68 parisian milieu which was probably unfortunately not restricted to just a few particularly antisocial types like these but please dont make the mistake of believing that what is recorded here has any general relevance for humanity in the way that a film by jean renoir or martin scorsese might be argued to have
2,the first and second seasons started off shakily with good episodes sandwiched in between average ones and at times resorting to clichd stories but once it started to set up the universe in which it exists and started to develop its characters more it became a lot more fun and entertaining br br the main reason this show succeeds it because of four men richard dean anderson peter deluise joseph malozzie and paul mullie richards dry sense of humour makes to show so much better peters directing is excellent and makes any episode so much more entertaining and joe  paul never fail to make a funny interesting episode together br br once you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters i doubt you wont like the show for those getting into the show i suggest the episodes the other side a good serious episode and window of opportunity a classic comic relief episode
0,the school nerd marty simon scuddamore is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab explosion set by them also where his face is scarred by acid years later all the jerks get invited back to the high school since closed for a reunion what they didnt know is that marty is inviting them back to kill them then a storm starts theyre locked in the school and marty starts to take revengebr br pretty silly the murders are inventive and gory and there are some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted schoolbut thats about it the humiliations inflicted on scuddamore are more than cruel hes stripped has his head dunked in a toilet and gets burnt and are just uncomfortable to watch considering scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this was released make them almost impossible to view also this movie goes out of its way to have nudity there is full frontal of scuddamore surprising for any movie but one girl decides to take a bath aloneafter they know a killer is wandering around after them and then theres the couple that has to have sex this is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everybody is going to be and can teleport himself to them it ends with a twist which had me groaning and rolling my eyes then another twist which had me wanting to throw something heavy at the tv the acting is bearablenot good but bearable caroline munro is in this too shes a very beautiful woman but not much of an actressbr br this gets a for some effectively gory murders and atmosphere otherwise its run of the mill and forgettable scuddamores tragic suicide has given this film more attention than it deserves
0,this is the worst ripoff of home alone movies that i have ever seen watch part and two but dont let anyone say that this is better than the first two i mean really you dont make a movie then make a sequel with the same characters and actors and then make another sequel with different characters and actors i mean it would have been ok if this want a home alone movie but they did make it a home alone movie culkin is too old now so youre suppose to stop making sequels goodness this movie makes me sick buy part and
7,i am curious yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile it doesnt matter what ones political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level as for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic nc17 that isnt true ive seen rrated films with male nudity granted they only offer some fleeting views but where are the rrated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia nowhere because they dont exist the same goes for those crappy cable shows schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight and those pretentious indie movies like the brown bunny in which were treated to the site of vincent gallos throbbing johnson but not a trace of pink visible on chloe sevigny before crying or implying doublestandard in matters of nudity the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude and the same cannot be said for a man in fact you generally wont see female genitals in an american film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica this alleged doublestandard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of womens bodies
6,this is a brilliant documentary that follows the life of herge and his creating tintin its based around a series of interviews conducted in 1971 and covers every thing from his early life and nazi collaboration to the final moments of his lifebr br brilliantly edited very cinematic and fast paced enough to not get boring this film will give you a new appreciation for the work of hergebr br the film makers make the film more than just another documentary using the latest state of the art technology and for a change putting it to good usebr br recently more and more documentaries have been making it to cinemas but this one as to be amongst the best
1,the concept of the legal gray area in love crimes contributes to about 10 of the movies appeal the other 90 can be attributed to its flagrant badness to say that sean youngs performance as a socalled district attorney is wooden is a gross understatement with her bland suits and superfluous hair gel young does a decent job at convincing the audience of her devout hatred for men why else would she ask her only friend to pose as a prostitute just so she can arrest cops who try to pick up on them this hatred is also the only reason why she relentlessly pursues a perverted photographer who gives women a consensual thrill and the driving force behind this crappy movie watching young go from frigid to fullfrontal nudity does little to raise interest but the temper tantrum she throws standing next to a fire by a lake does watching her rant and rave about her selfloathing and sexual frustration makes love crimes worth the rental fee but its all downhill to and from there despite her urge to bring patrick bergins character to justice her policing skills completely escape her in the throes of her own tired lust and passion patrick bergin does a decent enough job as a slimy sociopath if it worked in sleeping with the enemy it sure as hell can work in this but i cant help but wonder if the noticeable lack of energy young brings to the film conflicts with his sliminess im guessing it does and the result is a thriller with thrills that are thoroughly bad and yet comedic
2,red eye starts in texas where hotel receptionist lisa reisert rachel mcadams is about to catch the last red eye flight back to miami where she lives  works while waiting for her plane lisa meets the handsome  charming jackson rippner cillian murphy  they both seem to hit it off then when they board the plane they discover that by a coincidence they are seated next to each other once the plane takes off  they are in the air jackson reveals who he really is  that their seemingly chance meeting was not a coincidence jackson says that he is working for someone who wants to assassinate the homeland security secretary charles keefe jack scalia  they need her to change his rooms at the hotel where she works in miami jackson tells lisa to phone the hotel  make it happen or her father will be killedbr br directed by wes craven who is perhaps better known for his horror films such as the last house on the left 1972 a nightmare on elm street 1984 the serpent and the rainbow 1989 the people under the stairs 1991  the scream trilogy of teen slashers a short punchy fast paced little thriller like red eye seems like a big departure from the sort of film craven usually makes the script by carl ellsworth makes for a surprisingly gripping thriller that i must admit i really enjoyed at only 85 odd minutes in length its a very quick moving economical  straight to the point sort of film that focuses almost entirely on one tight taught plot rather than go off in various directions with lots of subplots some may like this approach like i did while others may not but i think it draws you into the action a lot more as it comes thick  fast without the film slowing down any  giving you a chance to relax i really liked the plot for red eye sure a film like this is always going to have one or two questionable moments in terms of plotting but what the hell its a film made to entertain  for me thats what it did i really liked the two central characters lisa comes across as very likable while jackson rippner an obvious play on the name of the notorious victorian serial killer jack the ripper is a suitably slimy villain with a cold im only doing my job type mentality another plus point is that i didnt think anyone behaved overly stupid here everyone actually seemed like human beings  the films plays out in a relatively plausible fashion i really liked this  its one of cravens better more recent filmsbr br craven turns in a good solid tense tight taught  fast paced thriller with an attractive cast some good action  a gripping plot he certainly doesnt hang about  once he starts the action  tension he never lets up far  away the most effective part of the film is when rippner is holding lisa hostage on the plane  once the film switches to miami  lisas fathers house it does become a little bit more routine but its still good a special mention goes to rachel mcadams who is absolutely gorgeous in this i could probably watch red eye again just because she is in it  looks drop dead stunning those who see wes cravens name attached to red eye expecting a horror film should think again since theres no horror in it at all despite the imdb listing horror as red eyes genre i am not sure about the ending on the one hand it was nice to see the villain live for a change which goes against traditional expectation but it might have been more satisfying to see lisa kill him in some waybr br dreamworks apparently gave red eye an initial budget of 44000000 but reduced it to 25000000 although its still a very well made film with glossy production values actually shot in los angeles  florida in california the film was supposedly written with husband  wife sean penn  robin wright penn intended for the leads but eventually the makers opted for younger leads as i have already said rachel mcadams is pure eye candy  is a total babe in this  worth watching the film for on her own oh  she puts in a decent performance toobr br red eye is a really fast paced taught tension filled little thriller that i enjoyed immensely i didnt think i would enjoy it as much as i did  i am glad i decided to watch it this definitely gets a recommendation from me  rachel mcadams really is hot stuff in this
6,some people dont like the animation personally i think the animation was quite remarkable given when this movie was done there are lots of older cartoons that i just love my problems with this movie are not the animation but basically the way it was constructed the characters are all just well goofy and for this movie they shouldnt be apparently everyone in lotr has a limping problem for starters just the way they acted in general annoyed me my two sisters and i were laughing through most of this movie i think that if many people had seen this before seeing the newer ones they wouldnt have gone im glad i rented this and didnt buy it there are few movies that give me a headache this was one of them however this isnt the worst movie ive ever seen although it ranks up there or down there depending on your view
7,although there were some amusing moments i thought the movie was pretty lame the longer it ran the worse it got once the action entered monument valley i found myself watching the magnificent outcroppings more than the increasingly silly and unconvincing interaction of the charactersbr br the character of the daughter was particularly incoherent first shes in on the deal then discovers the truth and she bails then shes back again then deserts them again then shes back again theres no apparent motivation for any of her decisions there were interesting characters some interesting scenes and many missed possibilities i would have to say the pictures was much less than the sum of its parts apparently the people who liked repo man were inclined to like this one searchers 20 is no match for the searchers
3,christina raines plays a lovely model in new york who seeks out a new apartment and begins to meet strange neighbors and reveal a secret about the building and herself slowly building up to quite a climax by films end this film has all kinds of neat plot elements from the roman catholic church vs the devil to the gateway to hell to bizarre rituals to a growing conspiracy and finally to a host of talented famous actors and actresses flooding the film we get ava gardner burgess meredith chris sarandon jerry orbach deborah raffin arthur kennedy jose ferrer slyvia miles beverly deangelo eli wallach martin balsam christopher walkin william hickey tom berenger jeff goldblum and who can forget john carradine as the old priest many of these actors ham it up  particularly burgess meredith giving a fine comicdemented performance as one of the neighbors with a little bird and a cat meredith is memorable as is balsam and chris sarandon some of the performers have virtually nothing to do like jose ferrer in a thankless role even if it is nothing more than a cameo the sentinel is a fine horror film with plenty of psychological elements and some truly terrifying scenes the end scene is repulsive and yet chilling i do find fault with some of the gratuitous sex and violence in the film particularly that whole scene with deangelo and miles was that really necessary i think not also the fatherdaughter stuff was a bit much as well but overall the film works and has a winning pace director michael winner does a workmanlike job and is effective creating tension and scary movie moments the scenes with carradine are particularly effective
6,feeding the masses was just another movie trying to make a little money off of the zombie craze that is going around mostly due to the popularity of movies such as land of the dead and the resident evil seriesbr br it starts at a television station which is guarded by the military and are reporting that the lazarus virus zombies are close to containment and the city will soon be free to do their business again the problem is this is totally false zombies are running rampantly and only a small minority of people are aware among them are torch william garberina the camera man sherry rachael morris the lead anchor woman who for some reason is listed as playing shelly on this website and roger patrick cohen their military escort torch and sherry are against lying to the people but the station is being run by secret service or some other government agency and they are heavily censoredbr br this movie gives itself a pat on the back on the boxcover saying we hold feeding the masses on a higher level than any o the three of the dead films by george a rombero the source of that quote has lost all credibility with mebr br let me just say that this movie is bad i dont mean bad like i was expecting more i obviously was though but i mean bad in that i could not find any redeeming qualities in the film whatsoever the acting in all parts are either over done or too wooden did anybody remember their lines or are they reading off of cue cards i cant even think of what the best part of the movie was or the best actoractress there really was not one if i had to give a nod to someone i would say roger the military escort was probably the most interesting character but that is really not saying muchbr br i would have to recommend to pass on this movie despite the boxcover looking pretty good its what originally drew me to the movie 310
0,i would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash there are films that are bad but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you the sex sequences so shocking in its day couldnt even arouse a rabbit the so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night marxism the film is selfconsciously arty in the worst sense of the term the photography is in a harsh grainy black and white some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle even the sound is bad and some people call this artbr br 
3,anne brontes epic novel the tenant of wildfell hall should be studied and read throughout schools and libraries and peoples living rooms its a fantastic story and tells the real truth on alcoholism and ruined marriages and a mothers fight to keep her son away from her brutal husband its so alike todays stories that we see and hear and i believe people can learn a lot from reading this book based on possible true experiences that the author had back in the 1840sbr br do watch this film its a great version of the book and very moving indeed im sure anne herself would have been happy with the way it was producedbr br excellent acting and great locations
2,it isnt the worst film ever made the actors arent apalling and the script and director are not completely inept br br it isnt the best film ever made the actors arent excellent and the script and director are not completely brilliantbr br it falls somewhere in the middle a fun somewhere an enjoyable well constructed somewherebr br no need to say dont take it seriously or so bad its good or it wasnt scary none of these comments are relevant br br cut has atmosphere its that atmosphere which is actually very unique and the one really original aspect of the movie which personally is what makes the film for me
6,what an awful movie the idea of robots fighting each other is cool but the storyline is ridiculous real human action laughable acting nonexistent and special effects on which this type of movie must depend are archaic i thought it must have been made around 8084 and was amazed to see it was from 1990 thats years after aliens ok lots of people said it was good considering the low budget but i just think whats the point it looks totally unbelievable i wouldnt mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a completely rewritten story because i still like the idea of huge robots beating crap out of each other
7,and look how a true story  with a little help of its friends  a welldone and touching script a good directing and a surprising great acting from a bunch of noname actors especially from the 4yrold jodelle ferland becomes a must seen movie 910
6,a masterpiece of comedy a masterpiece of horror a masterpiece of romance if there is anything negative to say about a chinese ghost story it might be that the special effects looked dated in comparison to modern technology the film has a simple premise a poor debt collector has to stay in a secluded area while trying to collect a debt of course it happens to be haunted as wellbr br what i wasnt expecting the first time i saw this film is that its one of the most touching love stories ive ever seen that is without losing any of the slapstick comedy that will have you in stitches unlike some films of asian cinema a chinese ghost story isnt hard to swallow for those that arent versed in chinese culture indeed it plays on timeless cultureless themes of the paranormal and romancebr br think evil dead if they had thrown a wonderful love story into the mix this film is for real despite being overlooked by many its absolutely among the best ive ever seen its ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres and cross cultural boundaries in order to appeal to humanity everywhere is nothing short of fantastic highly recommended 1010
6,i am an actorproducer director and what i am about to say are facts this project was the worst film in movie making history from producer to director and the edit of this so called film is a joke and i mean a big joke why would blockbuster released such crap i take my work very serious and this film is an insult to my profession was the director trying to make a bad movie i dont think so i seen bad zombie movies but this takes the cake the coffie and everything on the damn table this movie sucks i really hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because i am one myself but please consider in taking up a different profession i respect the fact that you completed a movie but i have to ask you  were you smoking crack  i mean the makeup on your girls the scary zombies what were you thinking to the whole nation if i could have voted zero i would have worst film in movie making history
7,second part actually episode 48 of the hit danish tvseries is slightly inferior to the first one but has plenty of laughs and scares as well this time udo kier plays two parts as the monster baby and his demonlike father other standout parts this time are sren pilmarks doctor krogshoj who must face the horrible revenge of dr helmer and once again patient mrs drusse tries to solve the mysteries miss marplestyle ends on a cliffhanger and following the deaths of lead actors ernst hugo jregrd dr helmer and kirsten rolffes mrs drusse you wonder how theyre ever going to be able making part iii but i hope von trier will give it a shot sadly morten rotne leffers the downs syndrome dishwasher died shortly after as well look for stellan skarsgrd in a cameo 
0,moonstruck is a movie that i liked the first time i watched it i really liked it the second time i loved it the third time now it is one of my all time favoritesbr br the humor is subtle but really good the film offers a lot of warmth humor the story takes place in a old school italian neighborhood in nyc chers search for love is enjoyable to watch this film is by far the best job nicholas cage has done on film the old man character is fantastic he lights up the screen without saying a word the scene with his dogs howling at the moon was fantastic but perhaps the best character is the one played by olympia dukakisbr br the films climax is a scene where the main characters have it out over a breakfast of oatmeal in the family kitchen exceptional direction and wrap up
4,i cant describe how terrible this movie is am i the only one here who finds the way its animated totaly disgusting the men of rohan look 100 fake with their poorly colored hair that doesnt even come close to matching what the actors look like the orcs looked terrible why does gandalf walk with a bad limp why cant they pronounce things correctly saruman isnt aruman there were other what sounded like terrible pronounciationsp of tolkiens characters all and all im glad the studio who made this pulled the plug out from the sequal it was just a terrible terrible adaptaion go watch the hobbit cartoon for a better cartoon of tolkiens work hell even the cartoon version of rotk is better then this dribble 210
0,the acting may be okay the more u watch this movie the more u wish you werent this movie is so horrible that if i could get a hold of every copy i would burn them all and not look back this movie is terrible
1,i saw the film tonight at a free preview screening and despite the fact that i didnt pay a dime to see this film i still felt ripped off ladies and gentlemen time is money and if you see this film you are leaving a benjamin on your seat the acting is torpid at best kiefer sutherland phones in his worst impersonation of jack bauer and michael douglas looks like he realizes he made a bad choice leaving catherine zetajones for the duration it took to shoot this turkey eva longoria is a nonentity she looks like shes reading her lines off a teleprompter and if you cant spot the mole within the first 20 minutes then you just landed on this planet from a world without tv and recycled story lines if you truly want to see a good secret service thriller rent in the line of fire if you see and buy into this one youll start to fear for the presidents safety because the secret service looks and acts like the grownup versions of the kinds from 90210 no matter what your feelings about w lets hope this art does not imitate life
1,i am watching this movie right now on wtn because that was the channel that the tv was turned to when i turned it on it is a not very credible and fairly boring story about a ministers wife alexandra paul falling in lust with a young studdrifter with washboard abs played by corey sevier there may or may not be a plot corey whips his shirt off a lot and alexandra swoons im getting the feeling hes supposed to be up to no good and thats why hes messing with skinny alexandra paul its not really important because as i said he takes his shirt off a lot and i just caught a glimpse of butt cleavage theres a lot of sax on the soundtrack which is just painful
7,this movie really deserves the mst3k treatment a pseudoancient fantasy hacknslash tale featuring twin barbarian brothers with a collective iq of hot water character names that seem to have been derived from a mad libs book and such classic lines as hold her down and uncover her belly the barbarians crosses over into the so bad its good territory
3,hawked as the most offensive movie ever guaranteed to offend everyone guess what it worked im offended that we shelled out money to rent this two friends and i were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on tv was true curse comedy central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us it was by far the worst movie ive seen since hollow man i generally avoid the crappy ones but got sucked into this one we have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it and his movie picking privileges have been revoked there is nothing remotely funny about this movieeven the adventures of dickman scene was sophomoric at best color me ped thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reasonnoit just sucked never watch this for any reason whatsoever not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny thats saying alot please for the love of all that is holy if you cherish your sanity never view this movie its many things stupid pointless and worthless to name a few but the main thing it was aiming for offensively funny it failed miserably crash and burn
0,12 for this diane keaton farcebr br someone should tell ms keaton enough with your annie hall philosophy and hatsbr br this flick is just too much as keatons daughter sara dies in a traffic accident while her boyfriend survivesbr br keaton who could not be reached by phone at first as she was in the sack with her pal and had pulled out the phone plug grieves in a new way for grieversbr br she retreats to the summer locale where all of saras friends are staying she cleans the house sleeps for two days and then begins to reveal things which were better not to be revealed it appears that sweet sara slept with her girlfriend and the guy who ultimately married the latter in addition she had an abortion thanks to this guy were all now put on this guilt tripbr br her only hope is to find the elusive diary that sara kept she also hopes that boyfriendadam who is a playwright will not include all this in another playbr br when the diary is found it has been written in japanese sara had a phd in this language its not that great news for mom when an excerpt of the diary is translated by a japanese cook in a japanese restaurantbr br naturally everything seems to tie up nicely in the end br br the title of this shmaltz comes from the wizard of oz every time mom and sara would speak they would both utter surrender dorothybr br as if this isnt enough during the course of this bizarre extravaganza of mourning keaton tells adam not to be another woody allen in his film interiors where he tried to successfully emulate ingmar bergman ms keaton also tries drugs with the group come on folks can we realistically believe that anyone in his right mind could mourn like this br br fair to mediocre best sums up this film
1,in 1976 i had just moved to the us from ceylon i was 23 and had been married for a little over three years and was beginning to come out as a lesbian i saw this movie on an old black and white tv with terrible reception alone and uninterrupted in an awakening that seemed like an echo of the story i was living in a small house in tucson arizona and it was summertime like everyone else here i never forgot the feelings the images of this story called forth and its residue of fragile magic and i have treasured a hope that i would see it again someday ill keep checking in i also wish that someone would make a movie of shirley verels the other side of venus it also has some of the same delicacy and persistent poignancy
5,i searched for this movie for years apparently it aint available here in the states so bought me a copy off ebaybr br four young hunters and three of their girlfriends venture into the woods searching for a bear that apparently has killed several campers what they find is an exvietnam vet gone crazy he kills some of his victims using a glove with long metal finger nails a la freddy krueger as soon as the night falls one of the girls goes for a walk after a brief argument with her boyfriend she gets killed after one of the group finds her body they all hide in their tents waiting for daylight once the sun comes up all of them try and make it out but fall victim one by onebr br seven bodies not a lot of gore but a couple of good murders especially the girlsdeaths the guys get killed in somewhat bloodless ways blown up in car shot to death knife through head br br overall infernal trap is a nice slasher film from the late 80s nothing new just well acted fast paced and some pretty ladies 10 out of 10
7,i watched this film because im a big fan of river phoenix and joaquin phoenix i thought i would give their sister a try rain phoenix i regret checking it out she was embarrasing and the film just has this weird plot if thats what you want to call it sissy was just weird and jellybean just sits on a toilet who both sleep with this old man in the mountains whats going on i have never been so unsatisfied in my life it was just total rubbish i cant believe that the actors agreed to do such a waste of film money time and space have sissy being beautiful didnt get to me i thought she was everything but that those thumbs were just stupid and why do we care if she can hitchhike whats the point out of 10 shame the poll doesnt have a doesnt even deserve a hopefully rain is better in other films i forgive her for this one performance i mean i wouldnt do much better with that film
7,i read the negative comments before viewing this film and undeterred went ahead and started watching i admit that i had to rewind quite a few times as the film is incredibly complex involved and full of detail that is a good thing but also quite unexpected in this culture of car chases explosions gratuitous sex and general violence that substitute for plot and character development in fact what a welcome departure however i am so used to not paying a lot of attention to what i watch br br this film is chock full of character development and plot line the kind that we used to analyze when i was in high school it requires actual mental participation on the part of the viewer what a nice change i would compare it to all the presidents men in terms of generic subject matter that is it is a mystery about intense misconduct on the part of elected officials and those with enough influence upon officials to essentially own them br br unlike all the presidents men this film makes an effort to give a couple of the characters actual personality in this sense the movie is a character study like the negotiatior with samuel jackson and kevin spacey in that movie their characters are both city employees and the plot is extremely intense yet the plot is dependent on the ability of their characters to cooperate with each other trust each and ultimately unite together against the corrupt police department there is more gun fire in this film and the specific plot is different but generically there are many similarities br br i will say that city hall requires a whole lot more concentration in fact i was struck how parallel it was to past and present political scandals ive seen in my life going back to watergate the thing is the public knows that something is wrong for sure but following the details is hard to do this movie is not even close to being as complex as real life but it actually is realistic to life in its complexity i think that is one of the reasons that previous posters have criticized the film unrealistic expectationsbr br if one watches this knowing what they are about to see and are up to the experience it really is excellent i watched it times in a row the acting is superb and the directing is flawless the weakest link is john cusaks accent
0,im not entirely sure rob schmidt qualifies as a master in the genre of horror since he previously just directed one horror film called wrong turn and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre but fact is that he made with right to die one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the masters of horror franchise there was a similar underdog story in season one when william malone made on of the best episodes with the fair haired child even though his other long feature films fear dot com and house on haunted hill sucked pretty badlybr br the story of right to die cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia but thankfully also features multiple oldfashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance murderous conspiracies pitch black humor and comic book styled violence whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husbands continuous adultery the addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially whilst cliff and his sleazy attorney corbin bernsen of the dentist want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor abbeys mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on cliff meanwhile abbeys hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in cliffs surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices after a few victims cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well right to die is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff i always hoped to see from a tvseries concept like masters of horror its violent and gory with a sick  twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences the euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons the atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling actresses julia anderson and robin sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks which is always a welcome plus and corbin bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a meanspirited and egocentric bastard great moh episode definitely one of the highlights of both seasons
0,scary movie is a let down to the scary movie franchise scary movie and were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great scary moviesbr br this film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escapebr br this movie isnt horrible but they could have improved quite a few things it is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the scary movie franchise then give this a watch  but i dont think you will like it nearly as much
6,loony tunes have ventured at least twice into the future the first time was with the brilliantly funny duck dodgers the latter time was with this  um  effort loonatics unleashed isnt without merit and might be considered a good product were it not that it isnt up to warner brothers quality wb cartoons are noted for their cheeky humor appealing at least as much to adults as to children these pedestrian superhero episodes on the other hand cannot fail to convince adults to pass them upbr br the premise of the series is that ordinary individuals bunnies a tasmanian devil a duck a roadrunner and a coyote live on the cityplanet of acmetropolis and acquire super powers when a meteor strikes the planet in 2772 whats confusing is that the titles section features these individuals with a countup to 2772 from the 21st century cute but frelling stupidbr br in each episode the super sextet  amid mildly amusing but essentially banal banter  fight various super villains for the most part these are types that appear in every mediocre superhero adventure series and even some of the better ones like many mediocre superhero series this one takes its villains far too seriously for the context and of course these guys are the only characters that laugh  the usual evil laugh of course why is it that villains in predictable superhero adventures always  always  laugh evilly at every opportunity animated material of this sort seems to leave laughter exclusively in the province of villains and occasionally their henchpeople andor henchthingsbr br in point of fact the makers of this series missed their best bets right from the getgo the superpowers of the characters are sometimes based on their previous normal abilities but sometimes not the problem here is that we dont see enough wb looniness lexi and ace have fairly ordinary biologically generated energy weapons and have virtually no personality traits one could describe as bugslike what we have here is basically the silly and drekish teen titans including its overly modern animation look but with animals fehbr br the other misstep by the programs creators is or are the villains as noted before these are not terribly imaginative and do the evillaugh bit excessively amazingly the writers totally missed the obvious technique of making villains from stock wb characters as well as the protagonists adding to the fun could have been say jupiter sam  as well as the fudd still hunting wabbits  as well as tech e coyote converted into a really neurotic villain  and so on ah the sadness of missed opportunitiesbr br sadly this whole production has gone into too much overtime that is a 2nd season nevertheless we can rejoice that theres something new out there for the 14goingon9 crowd the rest of us can hope for a 3rd season of duck dodgers
4,i heard a few friends one day saying that scarface sucks some idiot tried to make another godfather set in the early 80s now i usualy listen to idiotswatch cnn so i decided id stay away from it then my mate handed me the dvd and said this is with the pelicangs confused i tried it this is the best film ever made its more realistic than all this crap about racing stolen cars that are too expensive for someone in that area could afford cough2fast2furiouscough there is some humor though ie the pelicangs and the light 80s music still whats better than al pacino wielding an m203 i give this a  out of  perfect for fans of al or gtavice city
6,the plot its not so original if someone saw lultimo bacio theres nothing new a wealthy family in rome living everyday life thats is boring and false with everyone asking to others what they think about them really boring after an half of hour because its simple to understand where the story is going to finish this because its simple to see the moralistic view of muccino in this movie so even the hardest parts seem normal to summarise in the first minutes of the movie it would be enough and the aim of the movie were already said the family saw from a 30 years old i dont like to see movie that want to show the reality but for be coherent to his thoughts has to push more than the normal the situations really good how muccino put the camera in the right place moving with the carathers and its the only reason that bring me not sleeping in the cinema though always in the movie scream from the begining perhaps it could be good to see the family how they are in reality and not put the blame to something out of it morante was intense and great as usual but unfortunatly on a bad movie
0,william shakespeare would be very proud of this particular version of his play not only is it the best movie version of it but its also the only complete version of hamlet kenneth branaghs hamlet is simply genius not only because it was written by shakespeare but also because it had the guts to do the whole thing even if it went just over four hoursbr br we all know the story of the prince of denmark and his plot to avenge his fathers death so i wont go into the details of the story i will however tell you that the best part of this hamlet version is not the breathtaking sets or the stunning photography but the actors interpretations of each character i doubt youll find a better polonius than richard briers delicious portrayal plus you cant go wrong with julie christie and jack lemmon also derek jacobi a regular among shakespeare adaptations is magnificent as the antagonist to hamletbr br of course we must talk about kenneth branagh he wowed audiences when he came onto the scene with his first outing with shakespeare henry v he outdoes himself with hamlet sure oliviers presence was captivating but i think branaghs performance is wonderful when you watch him on screen its almost as if he knew exactly how shakespeare wanted the role to be played how he wasnt nominated for an oscar is a total mystery at least the movie got a few nominations and even an odd choice for screenplay i guess they know good writing when they see it though br br all in all youll never find a more rich and lavish production of the bards best play to say that the technical aspects were awesome would be an understatement if you love this play and are a fan of shakespeare you definitely need to check this movie out even if you dont really care for shakespeare the visuals will keep you occupied for the duration of the film you may not think youll be able to sit through all of it at once but youll soon find out that pausing this movie will make you want to see it even more
6,i dont know what margaret atwood was thinking to allow this movie to have the same name as her book ive always been a big fan of the robber bride and was so excited to learn there was a movie in the works i am aware that the translation of book to movie isnt perfect but this movie was the worst ever the names of the women are correct and some of the back story is correct but that is about it i feel like i lost a good portion of my time trying to make it through this movie this really should have been a miniseries to tell the story the way it was writtenbr br the actors for roz tony charis and zenia were wellchosen even though i was skeptical at first about marylouise parker i only wish theyd had a better script to work with because this really had nothing to do with the book at all

2,mendez and marichal have provided us with a serious cogent and painful analysis of the social spiritual economic and political crisis that 108 years of colonialism have spawned in puerto rico a beautiful island with the most hospitable people i have met and yet because our nation refuses to faces its imperial responsibilities puerto ricans are allowed to wither and diebr br the spiritual crisis that the colonial situation of puerto rico has created if undermining families and the basic institutions that sustain any society corruption is rampant to the extent that people are not paying taxes which has led a fiscal crisis for this nation and a sense of cynicism and distrust permeate the islands culturebr br fortunately a grant allowed this painful yet powerful film to be producedbr br a must see   
7,jenny neumann from the sexploitation flick mistress of the apes the american slasher hell night and others is helen selleck an american actress who gets a lead role in an australian stage production shes a virgin because as a little girl she saw her mom having sex and then accidentally caused the car accident that killed her meanwhile a blackgloved killer prowls around the theater slashing up people with shards of glassbr br major spoilerbr br the killer is obviously helen she speaks in her dead mothers voice washes blood off her hands after the murders and is seen killing a child molester with a broken bottle as a little girl but this has gratuitous heavybreathing pov camerawork and conceals the identity of the murderer until the very end like its supposed to be some big surprisebr br the entire cast seems obsessed with talking about having or trying to have sex and in one case even blackmailing their way into getting laid theres quite a bit of nudity and blood but theres no sense of continuity the photography is murky and the editing by colin eggleston who also scripted and produced is terrible the theater setting for a slasher film predates soavis film of the same name and argentos opera both of which are better than this one  by five years though and neumann is pretty hot
5,titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic the plot is simple noncomplicated or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film but the love story is an interesting one however kate winslett is wonderful as rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal billy zane early on the voyage rose meets jack leonardo dicaprio a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game if he wants something he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyesbr br the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures that sunk with the titanic which has recently occurred one of the survivors of the titanic rose dewitt bukater who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic with this the scene shifts to southhampton ireland where the titanic set sail from on april 10 1912 as all the passengers are boarding after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger jack dawson captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirtytwo years of experience to stretch the titanics legs out to full speed the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie on april 15 1912 at 1139 an iceberg was sighted they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanics many pleas for help the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking also the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle overall the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanicbr br many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship the core group of rose jack cal and roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer thomas andrew the white star line representative bruce ismay and all of the titanics officers were real the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards he had been a part of the white star line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaires captain when the titanic sunk the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former canadian hometown as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonenglish speaking nations in addition officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss not wanting to leave her husbands side mrs strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic furthermore mr goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best the richest man on the ship john jacob astor who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat in addition molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water her ticket on the titanic had cost over fourthousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware the gymnasium which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent recreation of the postvictorian era of 1912 the rich at this time practically ruled everything as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do the rich did not take well to new money such as molly brown as depicted everything of the time was very formal women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent crossreferencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtakingbr br a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise the director james cameron shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night in addition this film is a reflection of the 1990s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed however the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matterbr br technically the film is very well done to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie in addition a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship furthermore throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the filmbr br titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art a true epic like most history novels we know the ending but it doesnt take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming sound cintematography and editing if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900s and how they face disaster then this movie definitely is for youbr br 
7,hollow point is an alright movie worth a half price rental or if nothing else is on a good time waster with no thought required there are the requisite explosions and hammy acting and pretty ladies a pretty good cast with donald sutherland john lithgow and the lovely tia carrere this cast plus a light hearted touch make for a not a great movie but a fun oneon a scale of one to ten a
5,while the soundtrack is a bit dated this story is more relevant in the us now more than ever with not only blue collar jobs but everyones jobs being outsourced by us corporations while the government profits and american sufferbr br peter strauss is emory a steel worker who works the same job his father did for 35 years his wife is wellportrayed by pamela reed who is very realistic trying to support the family with two children when emory loses his job the mill is closed under the pretext of mismanagement but there is also embezzlement and cheaper wages where they can pay one steelworker in one month outsourcing what they would have to pay straussemory in a day never mind that these men are all good loyal workers who have values and try the best for their familybr br john goodman gary cole as strauss brother and a few other coworkers are also affected it is very disturbing and realistic some scenes between emory and his father are moving emory hopes his local union will be able to reopen the mill as they promise to do sobr br emorys brother lee already sees the writing on the wall there are no jobs left in the rustbelt ohio and they must move on however where in the us can they move to where will it be better for a bluecollar steel workerbr br there is a triumphant scene at the end where emory and his crew fill the loading dock with steel products the guard allows them to do this as a final gesture one of the men committed suicide and he has empathybr br overall a good message film about hard times right here in america something that few care to face until personally affected 810
2,i thought this movie would be dumb but i really liked it people i know hate it because spirit was the only horse that talked well so what the songs were good and the horses didnt need to talk to seem human i wouldnt care to own the movie and i would love to see it again 810
3,some thirty years ago author numa sadoul published a book length interview with the belgian comic book artist georges remi better known as herge the creator of tintin this movie catches up with sadoul today as he recalls the interview while we listen to the cassettes herge died in 1983 and see some old photos and footage of the man himself some parts of the interview were not published in the book at the request of herge and we now know these dealt with his separation from his wife after he had an affair with one of his collaborators who years later would become his second wife an interesting thing the movie does not address well is the shift in the tintin books from the early rightist and imperialist books tintin in the congo tintin in the lands of the soviets to fairly antiimperialist books just a few years later the blue lotus on the whole i come out of this movie knowing a few more things about herge and seeing him as a bit more unlikable than when i come in to the theater
3,as a south african its an insult to think that someone was actually paid to produce this nonsensebr br despite the fact that the director was one of the writers for the original shaka zulu mini this addition to the series is appalling the original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist leader and warrior a man who played a large role in shaping the history of local tribes in south africabr br the plot of this film however is nothing but hogwash scraped from the bottom of the barrel by a writer that has failed to impress since the midninetiesbr br while omar sharif and henry cele are good actors what is david hasselhoff doing here rescuing drowning slaves with his red buoy and bleached smilebr br i kept expecting blond busty women to appear out of nowhere and run across the screen in their tiny red bathing suits for no apparent reason not that this wouldve been any more bizarre than the fantastical plot line that was probably dreamed up after 10 pints of beer at a fancy dress party where someones caveman costume inspired the writer to return to an african theme for his next blockbuster
1,if bob ludlum was to see this mini series he would have cried this was complete waste of time and money i have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be cbs wasted time and money on this and it is embarrassing to claim that this was ludlums workbr br may be the creator should check out the bourne identity with richard chamberlain and see how good that tv series wasbr br poor mira blair anjelica and colm why did they sign to stoop this lowbr br horrible
6,i just watched this movie for the second time and enjoyed it as much as the first time it is a very emotional and beautiful movie with good acting and great family values inspiring and touching
7,this movie is trashpoor it has horrible taste and is pedestrian and unconvincing in script although supposedly based on realevents  which doesnt add much of anything but make it more of a disappointment direction is not well done at as scenes and dialogue are outofplace not sure what robin williams saw in this character or story to start williams is not convincing as a gay in a relationship breakup nor is the relationship itself interesting whats worse his character is compelled by an ugly pedophile story that is base and has no place as a plot device you have an older rory culkin tastelessly spouting d_ck_smker  in good fun which is annoying enough and then laughed up by the williams character finally you have sandra oh as a guardian angel adviser to williams and a thrown in explanation of the whole fiasco towards the end toni colletes character is just plain annoying and a rehash of her 6th sense performance with poorer direction very missable

0,this was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store dont make the same mistake i did this movie is tedious unconvincingly acted and generally boring the dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered i cringed at every scene they shared dennis hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self his role was clearly not a stretch for him and although the movie is supposedly set in puerto rico it feels a lot more like a hollywood movie lot all of the main characters are caucasian and several tend to speak english with pseudoirish accents odd anyway when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store keep walking
6,this film was abysmal and not in the good way as some have claimed first off the main character is a very unattractive gingerman second  wtf is going on with this van love the plot basically is boy wants sex so buys a van which in fairness is quite cool unbelievably given that he looks like a newt he scores with lots of chicks and he fails with some then he scores with a really hot chick and realises he loves this dowdy bird who played hard to get then he drag races with the hot chicks boyfriend and he tips his van at which point danny devito saves the day although he didnt need to because in tipping the van the ginger kid crossed the line first i gave this s as im willing to assume that theres some sort of 70s vanning subculture im not getting and also because theres some 70s boobage too
2,the movie sucked it wasnt funny it wasnt exciting they tried to make it so bad that it would be good but failed and thinking its cool to like this movie next to the hype are the only reasons that this movie is a successbr br the fact that at this moment 50 voted a 10 out of 10 for this movie seems pretty concerning to me either the movie going public is going insane or this vote is unrealistic which can have numerous causes and should be dealt with anyway it is a less than average movie which bloomed through mouth to mouth advertising its success can only be described as a marketing marvel
2,yes people are racist people are even racist in college thats a good point and the issue of racism has been dealt with many times before in countless films what sets higher learning apart from the pack is that it deals with the issue of racism in the most hamfisted and predictable way possible oh yeah its in college toobr br this film deals with this problem of racism the way frankenstein deals with most problems it bashes you over the head repeatedly in a brutal and sluggish manner most of the characters are cartoonish onedimensional caricatures lesbian feminist angry black man that react to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible instead of defying stereotypes this film is overpopulated with them the angry black men feel cheated feminists hate men etc one feminist even holds a sign that reads dead men dont rape see what i mean i dont want to give anything away but in this movie if someone seems like a shifty loner or a date rapist theyll probably behave exactly how you expect them to the changes the characters go through seems obvious to everyone but the people in the movie the big twist in the plot hinges on whether or not the violent neonazis will act like violent neonazis ill guess youll just have to watch to find out what happensbr br another problem i have with this movie is that its supposed to be gritty and hardhitting but they make nazis the bad guys i agree nazis are evil but thats my point everybody thinks nazis are bad were not breaking any new ground here nazis have been portrayed as villains since the 1930s the film doesnt challenge any viewpoints or make bold statements it just deals with issues we all know about in a clumsy afterschoolspecial like manner being antirape antiracist and antinazi isnt exactly taking a hard stance on a controversial issuebr br higher learning is predictable cartoonish and in a word stupid avoid at all costs
2,this movie portrays ruth as a womanizing hard drinking gambling overeating sports figure with a little baseball thrown in babe ruths early life was quite interesting and this was for all intents and purposes was omitted in this film also lou gehrig was barely covered and this was a well know relationship good bad or indifferent it should have been covered better than it was his life was more than all bad he was an american hero an icon that a lot of baseball greats patterned their lives after i feel that i am being fair to the memory of a great baseball player that this film completely ignored shame on the makers of this film for capitalizing on his faults and not his greatness
1,written by stephen king but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories on film a mother and son move into a small indiana town with a secret they are sleepwalkers feline type creatures that feed on young virgins this little story has its share of gore and special effects plus hints of incestbr br alice krige is outstanding as the mother others appearing are madchen amick brian krause and cindy pickett look for very small roles for john landis and clive barker stephen king cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery
1,personally while im able to appreciate really good movies i also have a strange ability to somewhat enjoy even the most crappiest of crap you know those times when you just want to sit there and watch some horrible cookiecutter action movie to kill time this is the only movie that i can remember actually shutting off in the middle and i have absolutely no intention of going back to finish it the plot was so contrived and predictable i was calling out what the next scene would be easily and im usually not very good at this the actors were horrible ive seen better acting in middle school plays even the scene cuts were bad the flow was all wrongbr br this movie is like a parody that forgot the funny
6,yeah i remember this one many years since i actually watched it the story was entirely surreal but nonetheless great what anyone who rates and reviews movies ought to bear in mind is what the respective movie aims at its the same with first kid which follows a similar pattern certain movies  like this one here  just aim at plain and comical nonsense such movies cant be rated from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer of course these movies lack quality lack a sophisticated storyline very often lack firstclass acting but if they do fulfil their primary premise  thats okay i dont have this movie here on my list of alltime favorites but i still thought it was funny had some very enjoyable sequences and made a good story brian bonsall is a smart actor anyway

7,i always feel strange and guilty saying it because im a fairly welleducated nonteenager but i actually sort of like the olsen twins and i respect the movies they make even though ive never really been their target audience when in rome was a traditional marykate and ashley movie complete with the foreign travel accents motorbikes adult romance as a b storyline fashion orientation and even the gag reel over the credits i enjoyed myself when in rome and the other olsen twin movies never pretend to be anything theyre not most of the time they only premiere on video and they never claim to be the next citizen kane or even an affair to remember my point is people who watch this movie and expect it to be anything other than another olsen twin movie will be disappointedbr br that said those who are fans of the olsen twins will really enjoy themselves for those of us whove watched them since the first episodes of full house its really great to see them growing into more mature roles this movie provides important historical and geographical information just like many of their other movies remember 10 downing street from winning london and the visit to the louvre from passport to paris as well as providing good clean fun that can be enjoyed by the whole familybr br as long as i still feel like im on my soapbox and as long as i can make it relevant to the movie let me take a moment to challenge those who reject the olsen twins in order to be a fan of the olsen twins you dont have to be some preteen valley girl from california in fact thats not really the target audience if it were the mka fashion line of clothes and accessories would be run through gap or some store like that not walmart when in rome while it does feature high fashion and globetrotting and two girls from a valley in cali isnt really about that its more about inspiring young girls who have initiative to let it take them places if that means setting the movie in some glamorous foreign city with cute guys on motorbikes so be it thats called marketingyou take an idea and sell it by making it appealing at least theyre sending a good message even if the means seem a little superficial br br basically dont knock the film until youve seen it and then dont knock it until youve tried to understand what the olsen twins do they encourage young girls to be creative intuitive and driven young women this movie does that i think just like their others kids  enjoy parents  do the same if you like the olsen twins you wont be disappointed
0,i was fully amped up to see this film i had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in new zealand i shouldnt have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt clarks worst film there is so much wrong with this film first off some of the acting is great in particular nick stahl as the bully and the girl with the curly brown hair i cant recall her name but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable especially leo fitzpatrick hes a veteran of clarks films now and he was so brilliant in kids but in bully he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually the screenplay felt like it had been written by a first year film student no sorry a high school studentone who has never seen a movie before and i couldnt fathom clarks intentions was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids existence it sure as hell didnt stop him getting in a damn good perv im no prude but i didnt need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every minutes i still maintain that clarks best film is another day in paradise its fantastic and i dont think hell ever top it
5,del  you are the dumbest smart person ive ever metbr br calvin welli had a brain but they lost it in the rewritesbr br i think what i find most egregious about this bastardization of asimovs work was how the character of susan calvin was portrayed in the books she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists able to think her way through a problem here shes just a damsel in distress waiting to be rescued by wil smithbr br there are passing references to asimovs laws of robotics but they are an afterthought to the cgi and action scenesbr br smith is likable as he is in most of his films but honestly the story isnt that good you figure it out long before these genius characters do
7,loved part one the impossible planet but whoops what a disappointment part two the satan pit is the cliffhanger of something apparently rising out of the pit was  nothing coming out of the pit then ages spent crawling round air vents to pad out the story the beast a roaring thing empty of intelligence so no doctorvillain confrontation id been anticipating the tardis is somehow inside the pit despite the pit not being open till long after the tardis fell through the planet crust and finally another ready made solution which existed for no logical reason  i mean why not plunge the beast into the hole as soon as the pit opened why not plunge him in all those years ago instead of imprisoning him anyway why not  i could go on but ive lost interest
7,superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was made the whole plot concerns someone trying to sabotage the superbowl and all the attempts made to stop them how tom selleck and donna mills careers managed to survive this is beyond me however the most frustrating thing about it was there was no football in it at all avoid this one if possible
6,for anyone with a moderate sensibility a moderate feeling of the human and humane condition for anyone capable of getting above the hollywood ilk for anyone who is satisfied seeing cinema which does not have a series of seagalswillisvan dammes blasting the brains out of anybody or seeing who gets into bed with whom for anyone whose intellectual level reaches a capacity to grasp sympathise with comprehend laugh with cry with natural tender heartwarming hilarious compassionate human beings le huitime jour is waiting for you jaco van dormael has not achieved simply a masterpiece that would have been too simplistic he has achieved one of those rare monumental works of art in the cinematographic world which defies any kind of encapsuling is it a drama is it a comedy no it is the story of georges a wonderful funny pitiful laughable loving frightened beautiful personality a sufferer of the downes syndrome it is a story which has you laughing through your tears but this is not one of those classic tearjerkers this film moves through a world that has you at once mixing your feelings of compassion or pity or even shame with those of admiration warmth and even love a successful banking salesman harry bumps into georges they were both going in opposite directions with absolutely opposing ideas problems and priorities skillfully van dormael melts these two unlikely men into a warm friendship but which is so much more than the good buddy friendship of those having a beer down the road this is a relationship which develops into a profound needing by both for the other the cuasisurrealist scenes fit in perfectly georges recalls or invents past scenes of his life while either daydreaming or sleeping even the almost phantasmagorical final scene is totally correct the only scene which might be considered a little out of place is when they steal a bus and drive it out of the showrooms however this does not detract from the whole this film is a monument even if your french is not up to much please bear seeing it with subtitles le huitime jour is worth the trouble as for anything else well just read the following commentaries  i go along with all of them this film is a joy it is majestic it is unique if you have seen rain man which i consider an excellent film you must see this one it is far superior because it has not the superficial veneer of famous hollywoodproduced worldrenowned actors it has pascal duquenne and daniel auteuil  ten oscars for these two and three more for jaco van dormael who cares yes 11 out of 10 if the imdb rating doesnt break down under the strainbr br magnifique chapeau

5,because this was simply awful 101 dalamatians was funny even if formulaic but this is nothing more than puerile drivel the same plot except with the story excised from it the worlds most intelligent and horribly annoying macaw tim mcinnerny proving that he really cant do comedy everone remembers percy in blackadder but that was his high spot  its all been downhill since then direction so poor that if a group of college students had made this youd throw it in the bin and tell them to do it again  properly this time ieuan grufford better go back to hornblower sharpish whilst glenn close and gerard diepardieu ought to go into hiding for several yearsbr br perhaps i could be too harsh after all i didnt manage to sit through the whole film it gets 110 only because i cant give it
6,watching the tenants has been a interesting experience for me it is the first film i have ever seen where i have shuttled at speed through parts of the nonaction  and i can normally watch anything from turgid action movies to serbocroat indie and find them fascinatingbr br the tenants is frustratingly sluggish and overorchestrated one of the main problems of the script is there is little realistic character dialogue apart from the set pieces where characters collide in a very structured setting to make this work the film needed to feel more conceptual which it didnt this leads to a lack of realistic character development everyone seems twodimensionalbr br the worse for this is the character of bill spear aka snoop dogg i found his characterization very uncomfortable and very unsympathetic at one point i even stopped the film because i got so annoyed by the characters aggressive violent and monotonal delivery the lack of any other personality layer apart from that of the reactionary on switch which gets really predictable after a while and i so desperately wanted him to have some redeeming qualities however one reason for this jar might be the nebulous time scape of the film supposedly 70s it feels and looks more early noughties if it had been more securely fixed in the 70s his character might have seemed more understandablebr br the lighting of the film was also awkward all the way through the soundtrack attempts to provide a certain gritty jazzinfused atmosphere that just did not come off largely because the set was too welllitbr br the tenants to me is an unbelievable film it doesnt depict real people or propose any interesting ways of thinking about race identity or the life of a writer be they white or blackbr br strangely i came away with the feeling that this project needed david lynch his eerie clastrophobic and obsessive look and feel would have lifted both the actors and the script into something quite remarkable
6,madhur has given us a powerful movie chandni bar in the past his next film page was one of the worst movies of all time it apparently tells the story of some high class people in india after seeing a scene where the man forces another man for sexual reasons to star in a movie i felt like spitting and breaking the dvd coincidently i did the reason why was the movie contains scenes of child pornography and molestation i literally vomited and was shocked to see a movie showing naked children very disturbing stuff there was no need to show the children fully naked one of the rich guys likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreign people british men in this movie i am shocked to know this film was a hit in parts of india otherwise super flop in uk usa and australia im from uk and this kind of stuff makes me sick shouldnt of been released in uk
7,the only words you need fear more than joe don baker if your thinking of watching a film are greydon clark  and if they are both there  run for your life  however this is a very funny film because they actually take themselves seriously  it starts out bad and goes downhill from there  repeated scenes  the good the bad and the ugly like shootout will have you rolling on the floor with laughter yes  hes the best deputy sheriff in texas  tracking a mafia hitman to malta as only he can  he makes his own rules  does things his own way  all the while wearing cowboy boots and sidearms cowboy style  you want to see a bad but funny film  go ahead on  its your move

0,undying is a very good game which brings some new elements on the tired genre of first person shoot em ups it tells the story of patrick galloway an expert of the occult and a formidable fighter who is summoned by a friend to his estate in ireland to investigate some weird phainomena the game is set in ireland after world war one so dont expect to find weapons like chainguns or rocket launchersall the weapons in the game can be considered antiques but the real fun in the game are its spells and the system they operate onour hero is ambidexterous so he can use both his hands at the same time he casts spells with his right arm and uses his guns with the leftso you can shoot and cast spells at the same time which as you understand very fun and also unique to this game the graphics are great and they can run very well on a medium power pclevel design is also cool and atmospheric mostly the game revolves around the covenant estate and the mansion but there are many other locations waiting to be discovered as you progress thanks to the talent of clyve barker the game has an excelent storyline and plot something very rare for a first person shooter and i said before a great and very spooky atmosphere the voice acting is also good but not excellent but the game has two main flaws first of all it is quite linear so when your mission says for example go to that room all the doors in the house will be locked apart from those that lead to the room of your mission this may save time but it restricts your liberty of explorationsecondly the fact all the weapons are antiques may not appeal to most fps players who are used to high tech weaponry as far as difficulty is concerned the game is very well balanced most of it is of medium difficulty but sometimes it gets more difficult but not frustratingly difficult overall undying is a great game definitely one of the best fps out there
1,i like billy crystal and i thought it would be fun to watch this film since i know he admired alan king and they would be funny together i thought i had seen all billys movies but couldnt remember this one and now i know why its so full of clichs and phony emotion you can smell each scene coming and going billy doesnt even get to be funny very often hes too busy trying to cry fake tears or show his angst at how badly his father let him down alan king himself is fairly likable as is the subplot about being an extra in the movies but what a coincidence that billy just happens to visit his father just as a major health crisis takes place etc etc or that two busy doctors can just shut down their practices to moon around in la and when the end comes boy does it come quickly almost as though the writers realized they had painted themselves into a corner and the only way out was to do a death scene mostly disappointing with a few glimmers of good humor
4,this game was really great and quite a challenge it has a great spooky story line and the graphics are also very good i would recommend this game to all horror fans and is very gripping from start to finish the only problem with this game is that i would have liked more weapons but thats just mebr br  a truly great game for rpg and shootemup fansbr br 
7,man this gets a lot of good reviews in the review books frankly i found it too slow and unappealing right from the start i kept waiting for it to pick up a little steam but that never happened this movie is vastly overratedbr br shakespeare with the king james english has never appealed to me anyway so it may just be me there is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film as they show ronald colman playing the role of othellobr br the good points of the film include  thanks to a restored print  some decent cinematography and a young slim and attractive shelly wintersbr br overall this is simply too boring too much repetition in some of the scenes to watch again besides we all know that most actors are nutcases anyway but kudos to hollywood for demonstrating it here in this story
2,really bad shot on video film made by not one not two but three amateur video makersbr br if youre going to make a bad horror film at least throw in some blood gore and nudity there is some blood provided by latex cut off arm props bought at a halloween store there are lesbians and hookers but no nudity or sex the lesbians spend a lot of time in bed but only talkingbr br there seems to be no editing effects fades wipes etc once in a while a bit of black appears to separate scenesbr br terrible music by bad heavy metal bands whose websites take up the majority of the end creditsthe werewolves are represented by rubber masks that are attached to just the actors face they didnt even bother to apply brown makeup to their necks arms or wristsbr br i guarantee a 10 year old with a video camera could put together a better movieno reason at all to buy rent or watch this film except as an example of how not to make a low budget video

4,this movie is about sexual obsession bette davis plays mildred this is a woman who men are drawn to not because she is a nice beautiful girl but because she is a sexual entity now the movie does not come out and say that but it is obvious there is a scene in the movie in which men are all going googly eyes over her she works as a waitress in a coffee shop she cant read and she not really anybody to look at but she is a flirt it is obvious the male customers in that coffee shop are there because of her one day phillip a club footed failed painter medical student comes in the shop to say a good word for his friend but he becomes besotted the moment he sees her he starts buying her things even pays for her apartment meanwhile she is seeing other people and she makes no secrets of it he dreams about her like she is a angel but she is no angel he is constantly thinking about her his med school grades are even failing so what the nookie is too good he wants to marry her but she rejects him because she is marrying another guy she always lets phil know she really doesnt have love feelings for him all of time he is heart broken but he meets another woman they seem fine but it is obvious he is still dreaming of the bimbo mildred does comes back with a baby and unwed phillip takes her in again but she starts going out with a friend of his the light bulb comes on a little and he kicks her out she does what she knows works so she tries to seduce him well it doesnt work and she proceeds to burn his tuition money up oh we have a club foot that he has problems about even though a street teenager who has the same problem tells him to lighten up about it he meets another girl named sally we have a march of time montage which shows her aging while he strings her along still waiting for mildred well he has no school tuition cant find a job finally sally and her dad takes him in not before another march of time montage showing him going downhill soon his uncle who raised him dies and he gets money to become a doctor meanwhile he finds mildred needs him again she has tb meanwhile he is still leading sally down the primrose path about marriage and he takes a job on a steamship finally the bimbo dies and phillip declares he is free now and he will marry sally i wished she told him to stuff it now i know my take on the characters are not going to get me any points but i feel phillip was the bad guy yes mildred is a strumpet but he knows it and he keeps coming back mean while he has two other girlfriends who love him but he treats as appetizers i guess the sex wasnt as good but in any case he dogs those women waiting for mildred not only that but the man who gets mildred pregnant is already married and when philip asks him what he intends to do about baby  apparently the babys name he laughs is off he has no intention in supporting her and baby and he is wealthy sallys father who has children say some pretty nasty things about women but he is said to be a old traditionalist philip doesnt seem to refute his feelings either men are using mildred as a boy toy but the men in this movie come out as unscathed yes she was not a respectable woman but far from a villain to me it is philip who was had the real problem and it was his sexual obsession for mildred
1,clever gritty witty fastpaced sexy extravagant sleazy erotic heartfelt and corny footlight parade is a firstclass entertainment what the movies are all aboutbr br the realistic satirical treatment gives a fresh edge to the material and its pace and line delivery are breathtaking to think that they only started making feature talking pictures years before this the brilliance of the dialogue cannot be matched anywhere today especially considering that realism has taken over and engulfed contemporary cinemabr br this film was made at a time when the hayes code restricting content was being ignored and the result is a fresh selfreferential critical and living cinema that spoke directly to contemporary audiences suffering through the depression and the general angst of the age id recommend watching any film from this period that is 19301935 for a vision of what popular cinema can potentially be

1,takebr br a famous playbr br a director with now ideas of his own who is usingbr br a copy of the stage design of a popular theatre production of the play mentioned in 1br br an actor for the lead  who has no feeling for the part hes playing and youll get hamlet prinz von dnemarkbr br i listened to the radio play of hamlet with maximilian schell as hamlet and i was so disappointed i hoped that the filmed version would be better that schell would at least have a body language to underline what hes saying  nothing then the set the minimalistic design is not everyones taste but usually i like it when theres just enough on the stage to make clear whats the setting and nothing more alas thats on a stage in a theatre it wont work in a film based on a play that actually has believable settings that the idea for the set was copied from the theatre production in which schell played the hamlet already lets say if that was the only thing to complain about i ask myself how schell could get the part of hamlet anywhere in first place and how anybody could allow him to play hamlet a second time if youve got the choice to view any of the about sixty films based on hamlet dont watch this one unless youre a masochist or really hardcore or like to poke fun on untalented actors
5,master director ching siu tungs perhaps most popular achievement is this series a chinese ghost story 13 chinese ghost story stars leslie cheung in some distant past in china as a tax collector who is forced to spend a night during his collecting trip in a mysterious castle in which some strange old warriors fight and meet him beautiful actress joey wangwong is the ghost who lives in that castle and is under a domination of one powerful demon a wood devil who collects human souls for herselfitself with the help of her beautiful ghosts leslie and joey fall in love and even though ghosts are not allowed to live with humans they decide to break that rule and live happily together for the rest of their lives this is not what the wood devil thinks and our protagonists have to fight for their lives and their happinessbr br this film is no less full of magic than other films by ching siu tung his masterpieces include duel to the death 1983 and the swordsman series which all have incredible visuals and kinetic power in their action scenes ghost story is full of brilliant lightning and dark atmosphere which is lightened by the strong presence of the beautiful and good willing ghost the effects are simply breath taking and would work at their greatest power in the big screen the camera is moving and twisted all the time and it adds to the fairy tale atmosphere this film has theres plenty of wirefu stunts too and even though some think they are and look gratuitous or stupid when used in films i cannot agree and think they give motion pictures the kind of magic freedom and creativeness any other tool could not give when people fly in these films it means the films are not just about our world and they usually depict things larger than life with the power of this larger than life art formbr br the story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm but the problem is again that the characters are little too shallow and act unexplainably occasionally leslie and joey should have been written with greater care and their characters should be even more warm deep and genuine in order to give the story a greater power and thus make the film even more noteworthy and important achievement also the message about love and power of it is underlined little too much at one point and it should have been left just to the viewers mind to be interpreted and found another negative point about the dialogue is that its too plenty and people talk in this film without a reason that is very irritating and sadly shows the flaws many scriptwriters tend to do when they write their movies people just talk and talk and its all there just to make everything as easy to understand as possible and so the film is not too challenging or believable as it has this gratuitous element just think about the films of the japanese film maker takeshi kitano his films have very little dialogue and all there is is all the necessary as he tells his things by other tools of cinema and never talks or makes other characters talk too much in his movies this is just the talent the writers should have in order to write greater scriptsbr br otherwise chinese ghost story is very beautiful and visually breath taking piece of eastern cinema and also the song that is played in the film is very beautiful and hopefully earned some award in the hong kong film awards back then i give chinese ghost story 710 and without the flaws mentioned above this would without a doubt be almost perfect masterpiece of the fantasy genre
1,with lots of sunshine gauzy light and shadow filtering through windows and into rooms tracking shots moving through crowds with handheld camera quickpaced editing and extreme closeups here and there the photography is the thing in this interesting artistically done filmbr br the plot of this film starts out as a bit of fluff about a beauty contest the film begins on a warm sunday at the local swimming pool where we meet the lovely lucienne aka lulu played by louise brooks  a bit of a showoff in front of the gawking men by poolside she soon decides to enter herself to represent france in the miss europe beauty contest much to the chagrin of her very jealous stickinthemud fianc a pretty annoying fellow really strutting down the runway the ten contestants display themselves in swimsuits while the winner is chosen as the contestant who receives the longest applause i was wondering couldnt the girls just walk slower to prolong their length of time  and thus applause  on the catwalk lulu is soon being chased by a prince and a maharaja but her hotheaded beau doesnt like the attentions paid to her by other men or her adoring public for that matter i guess he just wants her in his house cooking his meals and staying out of sight ehbr br louise brooks is beautiful and charming her presence helps enhance this film but its really the way it is photographed that held my interest the most a bit distracting is the odd dubbed sound which is a bit off the print on this version looked very clear and full of nice contrast though watching this i just tried to overlook the sound problems and watch the film visually and i found the movie to be excellent well worth seeing
7,by 1941 columbia was a fullfledged major studio and could produce a movie with the same technical polish as mgm paramount or warners thats the best thing that could be said about adam had four sons a leaden soap opera with almost terminally bland performances by ingrid bergman topbilled for the first time in an american film and warner baxter bergman plays a frenchwoman this was the era in which hollywood thought one foreign accent was as good as another hired as governess to baxters four sons and staying on with one interruption caused by the stockmarket crash of 1907 until the boys are grown men serving in world war i just about everyone in the movie is so goodygood its a relief when susan hayward as the villainess enters midway through  shes about the only watchable person in the movie even though shes clearly channeling bette davis and vivien leigh its also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles  but the script remains saccharine and the ending is utterly preposterous no wonder bergman turned down the similarly plotted the valley of decision four years later
6,elizabeth ward gracen who will probably only be remembered as one of bill clintons bimbo eruptions they have pills for that now is probably the weakest element of this show it really continues the tired formula of the highlander series the hero immortal encounters another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met but there is some conflict and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap special effects sequencebr br then you have the character of nick wolf basically your typical unshaven 90s hero with the typical sexual tension storyline seriously why do you hollywood types think sexual tension is more interesting than sex this was a joint canadianfrench production so half the series takes place in vancouver imitating new york and the other half is in paris just like highlander did
2,possible spoilersbr br i recently watched this movie with my 11 year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences ron ely is just right as doc cool calm almost always in controland with an occasional twinkle in his eye what more can one ask for i have never read a doc savage book so i dont know if it is faithful to the source but i enjoyed the light tone and derringdo many people have compared this movie to raiders of the lost ark which i dont think is fair the difference in budget is astoundingraiders must have at least 10 times the budget doc savage does not have the extensive location work that raiders has special effects are also at a minimum but come on people the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right the sousa music is catchylove that theme song every time i watch the film i end up humming the theme for daysthe best way to approach this film is to just relax and enjoy highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and doc chase the indian sniper throughout the rooftops of new york and the very funny fight sequence between doc and captain seas not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib really overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day i give it out of 10br br doc savage doc savagethank the lord hes here
1,anyone who loved the two classic novels by edward ormondroyd will be disappointed in this film all the magic and romance have been modernized out of his original story of a girl who does a good deed for a mysterious old lady and given three in return three what not three wishes but three rides into the 1800s on a rickety elevatorbr br the first novel is time at the top the second is all in good time
0,i think the reason for all the opinionated diarrhea on this movie is that most people have it out for sharon stone being around 50 and getting naked while playing sexy no one cared when the golden girls sat around eating cheesecake and discussing their first orgasm but to see someone post menopausal getting digitally pleased while driving i guess is just too much for some to handle lets face it she looks good shes light years hotter than my mother whos the same age its not an oscar or a cult classic like the first but ever since the turn of the century thats all movie goers seem to expect a cinematic experience that will touch your soul as such it never claims to be either its an erotic thriller that is both erotic and thrilling and is a continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate its the character of catherine trammell that helped give way for this sequel fans of the first movie want to see more of that frosty ice queenbr br the cinematography and art direction were lush and extravagant and made me want to move to britian for sure the score is amazing as wellbr br sure theres some overacting from some characters but theres some brilliant work from david morrissey whos virtually unknownbr br theres a setback in that the script is virtually the same as the first movie only plugging in a psychiatrist in place of the cop as well as the criminal decision of the mpaa to force the movie to be cut down even more which takes away from the guiltypleasure raunchiness that the story is known forbr br at the very least its entertaining and fun to look at it and thats the movies only intentions so if youve got beef with mizz stone maybe you should actually see the movie and draw your own conclusions before you spew forth your projectile vomit
3,what if marylin monroe albert einstein joe dimaggio and senator mccarthy were to come together in a mindbending evening of relativitybr br this delightful roman  clef never uses the actual names of the characters it so thinly veils and scathingly exposes not only for the individuals they must have been but also for what they came to represent over time if you are confused by allegory or if you like your movies served up predigested and mushy you wont like this film it is a demanding opus that rewards on many levels the viewer with the intelligence to appreciate it br br dropping for the time being the rigorous avoidance of using the real names of the characters we see einstein about to deliver a pacifist speech to a united nations hellbent for nukes being visited by marylin monroe after filming the notorious seven year itch scene that some say led to the end of her marriage with joe dimaggio they have a lovely interplay in which einstein stumbles with suitable professorial clumsiness around the innocence of perhaps the greatest sex symbol of modern times br br enter senator mccarthy who thinks einstein is a red he is determined to extract einsteins assurance that he will support the activities of the house unamerican activities committee while delivering the ultimate weapon in the name of peace add joe a surprisingly fragile and vulnerable person perhaps not perfectly cast as gary busey who hates marylins exhibitionism and believes einstein has become her lover even though marylin only wants to show einstein that she understands the special theory of relativity br br but theres more br br just like each of us these characters have their deepest fears which they reveal one by one in haunting flashbacks it is these weaknesses ultimately that lend humanity to figures we cannot help but see almost exclusively in the abstract today finally we see the shocking terror of einsteins vision and the statement of the movie becomes clear it is a powerful and memorable momentbr br insignificance is one of my top five movies of all time it is utterly amazing
1,this movie makes canadians and brits out to be asinine moronic idiots the men get stoneddrunk and then they yellbeat each other up in almost every scene the women are superfluous to the story  i do not understand what they are there for  they spend every scene causing a ruckus or worse milling around like mesmerized cattle apparently canadian women are either quarrelsome vulgar tramps or hulking hippie chicks its the standard knockedup girlfriend her loser boyfriend and his wicked mother ludicrousness that we have seen in countless movies beforebr br every character here is a carping infantile stereotype not to mention that they all looked like they need a shower and the idea of any kind of scene implying sex with george wendt  shudder  is enough to make anyone gag i watched the movie because samuel west was in it  but i cannot understand why he would have accepted a role like this maybe he needed the money ian tracey is a superb actor  the only one with a vague redeeming moment but his talent is wasted herebr br as for the rest of the plot  the three imbeciles trying to get their dope back  yawn  or karl  who is dead but who is actually a character very much alive in the minds of those left behind almost like rebecca in alfred hitchcocks masterpiece  although i am ashamed to even have thought to compare these two films why even bother karl is so galling that you find the circumstances of his death gratifyingbr br by the end of this wretched movie i thought they would all have been better off going down with him on that boat
7,the plot certainly seemed interesting enough how can a reallife brutal murder be turned into a truly boring movie well you can watch wonderland and find outbr br i had heard of the wonderland murders before this film was released and found it to be an interesting true story of some genuinely sadistic people unfortunately there is zero character development so we never get a chance to understand why any of this was done or get a good sense of the interrelationships between the characters the pace of the direction was very tedious this all leads to an extraordinarily boring moviebr br given that dawn schiller  a central character as holmess girlfriend  was an associate producer and that holmess wife was a consultant on the film we should have had the opportunity to gain some real insight into the characters
2,here is one of those movies spoiled by the studios insistence on a happy ending conflicts which have stretched out for years are settled in a few minutes it would have been far more interesting to inject a tone of ambiguity the talented barbara stanwyck is undone by a sudden metamorphosis from independent and assertive woman to a compliant female of the kind she has put down all her life brent as usual is well over his head and then there is the ludicrous situation of gig young playing a character named gig young someone mentions gig young and then who appears but gig young the actor worth seeing though far below what it could have been
4,wow what a great premise for a film  set it around a film maker with writers block who decides to take up tango lessons  hey and what an even better idea cast the central role to a film maker whos interested in tango gosh i wish i had that knack for genius  yes im being sarcasticbr br it amazes me that these type of zero potential for making money movies are made  come on unless youre a rabid tango fan  i do concede they do exist judging by the comments  or a die hard member of the sally potter fan club    theres nothing in this film that will make you rush off to the cinema to see it  even if youre into tango much of the film is taken up with meaningless scenes like a house getting renovated or a man in wheelchair going along a road br br coming soon the review lesson where a failed screenwriter from scotland sits in front of a computer writing very sarcastic but highly entertaining reviews of films hes seen  gasp in shock as theo robertson puts the boot into the latest hollywood blockbusters  weep in sympathy as he gets yet another rejection letter from a film company  fall in lust as he takes a bath and rubs soap over his well toned body  the review lesson coming soon to a cinema near you if anyone is stupid enough to fund the moviebr br ps sally potter is unrelated to harry potter
7,lion king 12 is a very fun and addictive sequel dont expect the production values of a theatrical release but do expect the highest quality of direct to video releasebr br it is set up as timon  pumba begin watching the original lion king in a darkened theater and abruptly switch tracks and begin narrating their own story this is done with frequent comedic interruptions for example during one particular tense moment a home shopping commercial pops on and a chagrined pumba realizes he has sat on the remote these little moments pepper the movie and whether you find them entertaining or not will greatly depend on your sense of humor if you are particularly bothered by movies that deliberately remind the viewer is watching a movie than this may not be your cup of teabr br animation is the best theyve invested in the disney dtv line and is integrated almost seamlessly with the original material the newer independent material uses a lot of the artistic style of the original the voice talents are all well performed though i couldnt help thinking of marge simpson every time i heard julie kavnerbr br many of the jokes in the movie will be well recognized by viewers as recycled over the generations but are presented more with the familiarity of comfortable quirks of old friends than annoyingly repetitivebr br the music has made me realize how much i enjoyed and miss a good musical integrated with a disney feature the toetapping opening feature of dig a tunnel is well choreographed and hilarious timon and pumbas take on the lion kings opening sequence and their introduction to paradise are also amusing the only problem was the reprise of the dig a tunnel at the end of the movie switching its lyrics and tune from defeatist to upliftingbr br story line is pretty well done and the integration of new plot elements is done almost perfectly though the final bit during the hyena chased stretched the storyline credibility a little the new story doesnt seem to handle saccharine or emotionally charged moments to well and does better when it is resorting to full comedy br br overall worth purchasing if you like all the bonus features that come with a typical 2disc set then go for it for the penny pincher who still is willing to invest on a good flick wait until it drops four or more dollars and go rent it right away br br damion crowley
6,andie mcdowell is beautiful as the 40ish woman whose late start at a serious relationship leads her to a considerably younger man and a subsequenet fallingout with longtime best girldfriendsbr br seeing a gigologolddigger in the sincere young man the girlfriends deadset on terminating this silly relationship go over and beyond the call of duty in helping out their friend who obviously is blinded by this gigolos tricky gamebr br a short succession of situations is absolutely ridiculous far fetched no longer covers it without these unbelievable scenes there may have been hope for a sweet love story instead all the viewer is left with is an involuntary shaking of head  these things just dont happen without giving away cliffhanger details i warn the viewer of having high expectations for this film most like me will be very disappointed on a scale of to 10 this one ranks a weak with me there is much better material out there this one isnt worth your time
7,religious bigotry is rampant everywhere australia is not immune to itbr br a dingo snatched a baby and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having killed her own baby i dont mean to spoil the story for you but you need to know the basics before getting kneedeep in what caused this woman to find herself inside a prisonbr br buy or rent the movie and discover how deepseated human hatred of those who are different continues to thrive around the globebr br this is a very moving motion picture with a terrific cast of actorsbr br both meryl streep with her famous aussie accent and sam neill whose accent is his nativeborn pronunciation are outstanding those with supporting roles are also quite goodbr br you will remember this movie for many yearsbr br see it
4,perhaps the best isabel allendes book house of the spirits describes an alternative chilean history this one full of magic a mystic veil plus some kind of omnipresent sadness this movie gathers a great cast plus a great art direction with a script that cannot contain all this books quality its unusual for a nearly unknown country like chile to get so well represented as it is by this movie whose perhaps only sin is to aim too high and because of that left the illiterate public a little upset mostly because they understood very little
7,journey of hope tells of a poor turkish family and their odyssey of hope which spirals downward into despair as they travel to switzerland in search of prosperity although this oscar winning film is fairly well crafted it is lacking in substance and has many implausibilities much of the films 17 hour run time is get on the bus get off the bus get on the boat get off the boat get in the van get out of the van etc time which could have been better spent or left out completely the story has a predictable conclusion especially for those who have an awareness of the common crime of trafficking in illegal immigrants a worthwhile and reasonably entertaining watch but overrated
6,the sarah silverman program is  better than those other shows no laugh tracks no painful jokes just a program the sarah silverman program if youre like me and you love comedy this is probably a show for youbr br sarah silverman brings outtherefunny and rightherefunny to the table with ease a mix of different styles which makes for its ownbr br this program isnt something you want to start a compare war with seeing as how it has absolutely nothing to do with them other shows this show is its own entity and i think most comedy heads will like it just finebr br go watch and see
7,generally i dont do minuss and if this site could i would give this movie out of 10 meaning i really hated this movie i thought uwe bolls alone in the dark was the worst ive seen yet but at least i gave it a 25 out of 10 in my opinionstephen dorff shooting at nothing made me laugh so i boosted the ratings a bit hell if it was if compared to bloodrayne bloodrayne would win a oscar for best movie if they were competingbr br now to the plot this movie is about the btk killer which is fine but theyve could have done better the start looked ok but thats it i had to fast forward most of it because the deaths where boring i like killer movies and even if they suck they could still get some cool deaths im not a fancy movie expert but believe me he would have shot himself if did see this sorry for rambling but theres nothing good to say about it because it looks like someone took a camcorder and film this this thing of disaster uwe boll your movies are no longer on my list of worst movies ever this took the cakebr br well sorry i couldnt explain the plotif there was one but that was the best i could now if you dont mind im going to crawl into a corner and move back and forth and reminding me of how bad this movie scared me for life ok not for life
0,real cool smart movie i loved sheedys colors especially the purple car alice drummond is wise and wonderful as stella i liked sheedys reference to how her face had gotten fatter the roadside dance scene is brilliant really liked this one
2,the story is about a little girl growing up in colonial africa but it is so much more than thatbr br anyone growing up in the south would experience the same things a longing for another one of a different race that cannot be consummated even a glance is forbidden there are no words needed their facial expressions say everythingbr br it is the story of a black servant prote isaach de bankol and a white woman aime giulia boschi their desire for each other is so strong that they torture each other because they cannot have each otherbr br the little girl france ccile ducasse is lonely and spends all her time with prote she really cant see this dancebr br one of the more irritating aspects of the film is the laziness of the colonials they cannot even get undressed for bed by themselves there world is about to end they just dont know it yet their racist attitudes will be erased with their presencebr br i think i would like to visit this africa it seems so quiet especially at night when you only hear the animals
2,jason bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands trying to make sense of what hes just done meanwhile a cia chief in nyc outlines the agencys response to whats just happened on screen an american flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot but as he speaks it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory as if it doesnt want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national securitybr br this shot effectively captures the mood of the film as well as portraying bournes quest to find out how he became jason bourne ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and securitybr br it is also probably the best film youll see in the cinema this year br br its just so intense bourne says to simon ross considine this isnt some newspaper story this is real and in the audience you almost believe him the camera shakes but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like youre there with bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters theyre portraying instead of just being actors performing wellwritten roles the action scenes are so brutally fastpaced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement the stuntwork is nothing short of amazingbr br the pacing is just incredible it keeps driving forward towards its conclusion but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action setpiece while theyre often simple the waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone theyre charged with such dramatic intensity that you cant take your eyes off them the film is just so focused on powering forwards that you cant help being swept along by itbr br with its intense action setpieces brilliantly paced storyline and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security the bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age ultimatum is its peak
7,you know a movie will not go well when john carradine narrates aka reads the script  plot synopsis over his characters funeral procession a mere minutes into the movie the narration is his characters last will  testament it stipulates that his estate be divided amongst his children and servants the children shall split 136 million equally but if any should die then that share is split amongst the remainders if all the children should die then it is divided amongst the servants to be eligible they must live in the family estate for a week it sounds like the typical plot of a reality showbr br there is little subtext as to the nature of the deans they are a powerful and severely dysfunctional family but the real trouble starts with the drowning of that dog from the opening voiceover by john carradine you expect this movie will lead to a machiavellian cat and mouse game with a twist ending br br that journey is painfully slow and pointless we trudge through minutes of watching people sitting around playing pool throwing darts the misuse of the through the fish bowl shot dramatic conversations between silk cravat wearing men constant bickering misplaced circus music bizarre flashbacks reminiscent of fauxgerman expressionism the horror aesthetic of the 4th grade and heaps of dramatic overacting this all inevitably leads to the expected  ungratifying ending you will be happy to still be alive but the pain might be too great to bear alone share children sharebr br celluloid rehab
6,some news reporters and their military escorts try to tell the truth about a epidemic of zombies despite the government controlling the media the makings of the film dont understand that the george romero zombie films only worked because he kept his politics subtly in the background of most of his films land of the dead withstanding this satire is about as subtle as a brick to the face or a bullet to the head is more apropos for this scenario whats subversive or subtle about seeing a military guy masturbating to death and destruction anything nuanced about the various commercials that are intercut with the film nope furthermore the acting is uniformly horrible the characters thoroughly unlikable and the plot inane add this all up and you have the worst most incompetent zombie film since chud reared its hideous headbr br my grade d
6,i can not believe i wasted my money to rent this movie i thought it was a porn flick when it started and it never got any better the acting the music drowning out the actors horrible save your money you have to read the movie all the way through bc they knew the music would drowned out the speaking lines i never got the part about the slaughterhouse or the need to continue to show cows and pigs being butchered what did that have to do with the real btk killer i understand why there were no famous actorsactresses in this movie the script would have turned me away within the first page of reading you would be better off watching paint dry
6,this is the first jean renoir silent film i have watched and perhaps rightly so since it is generally regarded to be his best besides being also his first major work overall it is indeed a very assured and technically accomplished film which belies the fact that it was only renoirs sophomore effort for fans of the director it is full of interesting hints at future renoir movies especially the diary of a chambermaid 1946 and the golden coach 1952  in its depiction of a lower class femme fatale madly desired by various aristocrats who disgrace themselves for her  but also the rules of the game 1939  showing as it does in one sequence how the rowdy servants behave when their masters backs are turned away from them  and french cancan 1955  nana is seen having a go at the scandalous dance at one point personally i would say that the film makes for a respectable companion piece to gw pabsts pandoras box 1928 josef von sternbergs the blue angel 1930 and max ophuls lola montes 1955 in its vivid recreation of the sordid life of a courtesanbr br having said all that the film was a resounding critical and commercial failure at the time of its release  a mad undertaking as renoir himself later referred to it in his memoirs which not only personally cost him a fortune he eventually eased the resulting financial burden by selling off some of his late fathers paintings but almost made him give up the cinema for good stylistically nana is quite different from renoirs sound work and owes a particular debt to erich von stroheims foolish wives 1922 a film renoir greatly admired  and on a personal note one which i really ought to revisit presto having owned the kino dvd of it and the other von stroheims for years now anyway nana is certainly not without its flaws a deliberate pace makes itself felt during the overly generous 130 minute running time with some sequences the horse race around the midpoint in particular going on too longbr br the overly mannered acting style on display is also hard to take at times  particularly that of catherine hesslings nana and raymond guerincatelains georges hugon one of her various suitorsalthough technically they are being their characters ie a bad actress who takes to the courtesan lifestyle when she is booed off the stage and an immature weakling respectively however like anna magnani in the golden coach hessling renoirs wife at the time by the way is just not attractive enough to be very convincing as the epitome of elegance as another admirer describes her at one stage who is able to enslave every man she meets other notables in the cast are dr caligari himself werner krauss as nanas most fervent devotee count muffat jean angelo as an initially skeptical but eventually tragic suitor of nanas and future distinguished film director claude autantlara billed as claude moore and also serving as art director here as muffats close friend but who is secretly enamored with the latters neglected wife br br the print i watched  via lionsgates jean renoir 3disc collectors edition  is for the most part a lovingly restored and beautifullytinted one which had been previously available only on french dvd being based on a classic of french literature by emile zola no less it cannot help but having been brought to the screen several times and the two most notable film versions are dorothy arzners in 1934 with anna sten and lionel atwill and which i own on vhs and christianjaques in 1955 with martine carol and charles boyer which i am not familiar with
1,making a book into a movie by following the story pagebypage is never a good idea when people read the book they automatically start making their own mental movie of who the characters look like the places they exist in how the situations progress and everybodys mindseye opus is different which is why when the real movie finally comes out youre always going to have a tickedoff segment of the moviegoing audience who are disappointed that it just doesnt measure upbr br all a screenwriter and a director can hope to accomplish is whatever their own vision of the movie is and hope that it comes as close as possible to what their audience is expecting to seebr br there is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novels of stephen king when filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying carrie salems lot the dead zone or they can be what fans consider to be a gawdawful mess kubricks version of the shining the miniseries for it and the tommyknockers br br although its not even close to being the perfect king adaptation pet sematary has so many moments of just skinandbonedeep unease that seemed to have bled onto the screen directly from the book that you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings for that we have music videoturnedfilm director mary lambert to thank she also directed siesta not exactly a horror movie but another freakyashell mustsee you should put on your list working from a screenplay by the manster himself and probably one of his better onesbr br since the majority of you know the story i wont put you to sleep with too many of the details dr louis creed dale midkiff has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country well almost perfect except for two nasty little details the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway out in front and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back since louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a sonwell even if you havent read the book do the frickin math it is a king story after all so no mystery where this is headed br br its not so much the destination that counts here but the spooky stops along the way certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to shivery screaminducing life here rachel creeds star treks denise crosby horrific memory of her terminally ill crippled sister louiss encounters with the mortally injured jogger victor pascow brad greenquist both before and after his death the trip into the other cemetery beyond the pet cemetery and that third actif it doesnt give you a few nightmares maybe you should check your pulsebr br good performances by all here especially the late fred gwynne as the wellintentioned neighbor jud crandall who gets the best line in the story that sums it all up sometimes dead is betterbr br about the only problem with the movie version is the casting of louiss son gage miko hughes knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a kid that age to seal the deal on this lambert and crew still did the best they could and unfortunately hughes at the time was just too damn cute to sell his intended role as an evil demonpossessed zombie this takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up though the scenes where hes featured are still masterfully staged especially gwynnes death scenebr br other than that everything else is still about as good as it gets carrie still holds the title for best king adaptation as far as im concerned but sematary is right up there in the top fivebr br still will anything adapted for the screen based on a king book be as terrifying as reading the story not bloody likelyfor now
4,with movies like this you know you are going to get the usual jokes concerning ghosts eva as a ghost is pretty funny and the other actors also do a good job it is the direction and the story that is lacking that could have been overlooked had the jokes worked better the problem only is that there arent many jokes sure i laughed a couple of times apart from the talking parrot there wasnt an ounce of creativity to be noticed in the movie i blame the director not using the premise to its full potential eva certainly has the comedic skill to show more but did not get the opportunity to do so overall this movie is ideal for a sunday afternoon other than that it can be skipped completely
6,ive seen this film on sky cinema not too long ago i must admit it was a really good western which features of the big names on one side theres charlton heston playing the infamous and retired lawman samuel burgade on the other the late james coburn playing the villainous zach provo seeking revenge on burgade no matter what the costbr br the good thing about this film was there was some really good characters most of the actors played it out really well especially james coburn who i find that he was really mean in this film but that how it wasbr br christopher mitchum who ive seen everywhere in other films playing hal brickman i felt his character was left out in the cold but he manage to get himself back in by teaming up with burgade to bring down provos possesbr br all in all it was a great film very good to watch great score from the late jerry goldsmithbr br wonderful piece of western persona out of 10
6,im stunned that the reviewers  imdb gave this tv film as a high a rating as they did its an innocuous sweet uncomplicated clich of a film that had two big names from the past in it both of whom did a decent job but this film reeks of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channels i like a good romance as well as anyone but as my wife and i were watching thisand before we saw the ratingwe said there are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because theres nothing in it to challenge their brains their faith their comfort level or their cultural preferences its possible to make a good film like that and away from her is an example but this was amateur hour there are some quite good films rated much lower than this one truly another in a long line of woefully inadequate holiday films watch the family stone its miles ahead of this schlock
1,im not aware of largo winch as a comic book or is it graphic novel i actually dont know but i have to admit hearing about an agenthero movie i did expect quite something different than what i actually gotbr br while it was startling to watch this at first it was nice watching this move along you could never really tell where it would go some twists are foreseeable but in general you can never really say were it will end up going a more than stellar performance from the lead actor and a really good support cast make this an enjoyable watch not as action packed as some might hope or expect for a movie like that but a really good mixture
3,still a sucker for pyuns esthetic sense i liked this movie though the unfinished ending was a letdown as usual pyun develops a warped sense of humour and kathy longs fights are extremely impressive beautifully photographed this has the feel it was done for the big screen
5,my wife and i just finished this movie and i came onto to imdb to commiserate with the reviewers that found this movie less than satisfactory however of the 10 pages of reviews only a handful are negative i feel that this movie is a great concept gone horribly awry and i want to warn those who are looking to watch the movie into the futurebr br i admit im more inspired to write reviews when i dont like a movie than as to when i do so my handful of reviews are all negative still that doesnt mean im biased towards not enjoying a movie but i often find more eloquent reviews of movies i do enjoybr br paris je taime is the most pretentious movie ive seen in years by using an intelligent concept and attaching some big talent to a couple of the way to many short stories the movie ends up the worst of all worlds it is art for arts sake but something that a year old could dream up and accomplish giving the director free reign of minutes of screen time proves why there is a division of labor even in entertainment directors cant write writers cant direct id like to throw in also that clint eastwood is overrated but that is because hes an actor turn director which rarely works eitherbr br what ends up on the screen is a garbled mess of short stories that dont make any sense are not completed in minutes and in total spoil paris to me why call it paris je taime when a more apropos title is cluster fck there are only a couple stories that are watchable most notably the piece by alfonso cuarn but everything else will fall into obscurity the coen brothers short is passable but can you name a movie of theirs that does not contain a scene with a pick guitar its as if all the directors decided on doing whatever it is they want to do and chose paris as the place to do it as we all love paris present company included we are blinded by the fact that this movie sucks in fact i think they put the directors names on each of the shorts because directors saw how poor of a film this is and decided to make sure they were blamed only for their minutes seriously seriouslybr br people natalie portman is not a good actress she is is not a pixie dream girl waiting to be yours and maggie gyllenhaal why are you people acting or just regurgitating performances from other movies im looking at you natalie portman garden state closer elijah wood sin city and catalina sandino moreno maria full of gracebr br one final comment on the acting i give double kudos to nick nolte for acting and looking more humane than you have in ages or perhaps ever will again find his short on youtube as his minutes are quite enjoyablebr br writing short stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors have gotten it right im thinking of ernst hemingway raymond carver f scott fitzgerald and john cheever just to name a few it is much harder than writing a full novel and only the truly talented can accomplish this the same can be said about short films it appears that only one director will live on in the annals of historybr br if you uphold paris as a gem to be discovered and reflected through your own lenses with your own story then dont expect to enjoy this movie at all the directors either didnt care or were lazy in either scenario by the time you are reading this it means you rented it praise be that you didnt pay 10 dollars a head in theaters for it
0,first of all riget is wonderful good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time nice combination of strange dogma style of telling the story together with good music and great actors but unfortunately theres no the end as for me its unacceptable i was thinking how it will be possible to continue the story without helmer and drusse and i have some idea i think lars should make riget iii a little bit different im sure that 3rd part without helmer wouldnt be the same so heres my suggestion mayble little bit stupid maybe not i know that lars likes to experiment so why not to make small experiment with riget3 i think the only solution here is to create puppetdriven animation like for example team america by trey parker or even computer 3d animation i know its not the same as real actors but in principle i believe it could work only this way its possible to make actors alive again for riget fans this shouldnt be so big difference  if the animation will be done in good way average watcher will consider it normal just after first few shots of the movie the most important thing now is the story its completely understandable that its not possible to create riget with the actors nowadays so why not to play with animation and look for the possibilities that it gives to you even marketing one great director finishes his trilogy after 10 years using puppet animation just dreamsbr br i hope to see riget someday or even to see just the script im curious how the story ends and as i expect everybody here dobr br greets slajbr br ps im not talking about the kingdom hospital by stephen king 
3,im watching it now on pink serbia tv station and i must say this is a crap shallow no acting effects too sloppy i mean who made this seriesbr br this was a stupid attempt of the studios to make some more money on the success of the film ok the film was great in 1994 when it came out but the seriesbr br some times you can see how idiotic the lines are in the speech of the characters i mean did they actually pay someone to write that was that someones relative at the studio this is no scifibr br the film was the bomb the series suck
5,dark remains is a home run plain and simple the film is full of creepy visuals and scares that will make the most seasoned horror veteran jump straight out of there seat the staircase scene in particular these guys are good although they werent working on a huge budget everything looks good and the actors come through dark remains does have one of those interpretive endings which may be a negative for some but i guess it makes you think cheri christian and greg thompson are spot on as the grieving couple trying to rebuild there lives however some side characters like the sheriff didnt convince me they arent all that important anyways i give dark remains a perfect ten rating for being ten times scarier than any recent studio ghost story japanese remake
7,i just cant understand the negative comments about this film yes it is a typical boymeetsgirl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just flies by henstridge talk about winning the genepool lottery is as magnetic and alluring as ever who says the golden age of cinema is dead and vartan holds his ownbr br there is simmering chemistry between the two leads the film is most alive when they share a scene  lots it is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get togetherbr br ignore the negative comments  if you are feeling a bit blue watch this flick you will feel so much better if you are already happy then you will be euphoricbr br ps i am 33 male from the uk and a hopeless romantic still searching for his princess
0,haha you have to just smile and smile if you actually made it all the way through this movie it like says something about myself i guess the movie itself was created i think as some sort of psychological test or like some sort of drug to take you to a place you have never been before when wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical piece the tractacus sp he said it was meaningless and useless but if you read it after you were done it would take you to a new level like a ladder and then you could throw away the work and see things with clarity and true understanding this movie is the same i thinkbr br as a movie it is without a doubt the worst movie i have seen in a long long time in such a unique way first of all this is snipes i loved watching this guy kick ass in various movies and i have suffered through a few weak ones however although you know the movie might suck you would never suspect that it could be as bad as it actually was which is the fun of it i mean this is snipes you know it might be good but it will be alright right smilebr br so this thing on every level is pure boredom pure unoriginality the reference to the professional is both dead on and obvious yet so poorly done as to be comical there is not one character in this movie that is interesting in the least and to make the whole thing more surreal they have a soundtrack that sort of sounds like parts to various bourne identity type movies only isnt quite right in fact although it seems close to action movie background music it just so happens it is done in a manner that will grate on you fantasticallybr br then all the scenes in the total pitch black where honestly since the characters are so flat you dont really care whats going to happen but regardless after it happens and someone is killed you just say to yourself was i supposed to see that what else how about scenes with blinding obnoxious flashing at a strobe lights pace for a period of time that is too long to bear sure lets throw that in how bout this though when you are straining and your eyes cant handle it any longer do some more of these in the dark kills where you really dont see what happened and on top of that lets face it you dont care you were past bored way from the beginningbr br so i drifted in and out a couple times but i caught almost all of this movie and it becomes something you can watch without something that engages your mind on any level therefore it becomes something you can effectively zone out with and begin to think about your life where its going where its been what we are as peoplebr br and that that is the true magic of this film
5,lets cut a long story short i loved every minute of it a lavish fantasy in true arabiannights style theres an evil magician a pretty princess a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after modern hollywoond sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic only quibble the special effects are pretty dated loved sabu with the djinns foot though
4,i watched this hoping to find out something i didnt know about modern historys most infamous man and couldnt help thinking that history has been rewritten in hitlerthe rise of evil  hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to have one of her admirers shot  hitler turned up with a gun in his hand to arrest ernst rohm  forgive me for asking but havent the writers confused adolph hitler with tony montana from scarface  thats bad enough but what really offended me was that theres entire chunks of historical context missing in this mini series  germany lost the first world war and the allied powers made germany pay a heavy price for doing so it was this economic environment that led the german people to have someone  anyone  to restore their pride and thats why they turned to nazism  the german humiliation of the 1920s caused by the allied powers seems to be entirely missing therefore there is no way that hitlerthe rise of evil can be taken seriously as a historical document and i havent even mentioned that himmler and goering are conspicous by their absence br br there is one positive point about the mini series and thats robert carlyle in the title role  okay some of his mannerisms are wrong and his voice is a little too loud  archive recordings show that hitler had a soft seductive voice  but carlyle is a charismatic actor and he does manage to communicate hitlers own charisma on screen  comments in the british press that carlyle resembles the synth player from sparks more than adolph hitler are unfounded and he gives one of the better interpretations of hitlerbr br i liked the performance by robert carlyle but i hated everything else about this mini series and wondered why on earth it was made in the first place  theres nothing to recommend it to serious history fans
0,whenever i see most reviews its called a misfire for eddie murphy these critics want to take a look at some of the stuff hes doing these days and maybe soften their stance in retrospect the golden child is not highbrow entertainment but thanks to some of the cast it breaths new life into old clichs and gives murphy one of his best roles i dont understand the pervading lack of love for its efforts at all perhaps it was released at a time when the establishment had grown weary of knockabout thrillaminute adventures steven spielberg started it with indiana jones its unfair to make this one a scapegoat when what is possibly its biggest sin is also utterly harmless theres nothing necessarily wrong with trying to capitalise on trendsbr br yes its silly but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that ridiculous is where hollywoods idea of mysticism begins and ends whats more important than believability with a story like this is that the audience have entertaining tour guides on hand to show them the mysterious sights michael ritchie and eddie murphy fit the bill for this capacity just fine my advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the ride
7,this would have worked a lot better if it had been made as mitchell in malta at least then we would have been spared the sight of joe don baker running around an otherwise scenic mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfitnot to mention acting like an old west gunslinger mitchell being mitchell the film wouldnt have suffered from a lack of gratuitous police brutality either oh well at least the comic comments of mike and the bots made this enjoyable fare as an episode of mst i cant imagine watching it on its own however
6,ahh yes the allstar blockbuster take a soso concept stuff it into a script and load it down with every single freakin special effect that the wizards of hollyweird can conjure up then round up the usual suspects hot upandcomers hasbeens wannabes and neverwuzzes and stick em all in ensemble roles of various sizes in front of the unforgiving eye of the cameras and hope to gawd that some of them arent too old to remember their linesbr br leave it to the bishops of box office to apply the concept to horror films at last as was the case with the postexorcist thriller the sentinel novelist jeffrey konvitz decided to try and oneup ira levins rosemarys baby scenario of creepy and ultimately satanic neighbors in a new york brownstone the result was a controversial bestseller that some claimed bordered on the plagiaristic and an equally controversial topheavystarladen vehicle cowritten and directed by death wishs michael winner but for many unsettlingly different reasonsbr br cristina raines nashville plays successful model alison parker who is pretty much over stressed and overworked i wont add overpaid i mean she is a model so that would be redundant not just by her 247 schedule by also by her insistent  wannagetmarried rightnow boyfriend michael chris sarandon of dog day afternoon and the classic sobig movie lipstick one of the ways she decides to try to get away from it all is to move into her own place a big beautiful brownstone in manhattan which shes able to get dirtcheap that shouldve been the big red flag  cheap real estate in new york from the mysteriously accommodating broker miss logan golden age screen vet ava gardner fresh from the storm drain in earthquakebr br things seem fine at first but ah yesthen comes the noises and the loud pounding from the apartment upstairs at night and what about the really strange neighbors like gerde sylvia miles and sandra a very early beverly dangelo the nice single friends read lesbians living together and kindly old mr charles chazen a nicely creepy burgess meredith who seems maybe a little too concerned with alisons welfare and thats not to mention other assorted squirrelly cohabitants youll never hear the phrase black and white cat black and white cake again without wanting to laugh milk through your nose and possibly vomit simultaneously especially the old blind priest living in the penthousebr br things really start to go downhill when an apparitionladen nightmare of alisons morphs into a grisly murder in one of the movies most underwearstaining scares and both alison and michael with some assistance from alisons bff jennifer deborah raffin begin to piece together the puzzle that reveals the brownstones dark origins as well as the murderous agenda of its otherworldly inhabitants not to mention alisons connection to them which as it turns out is anything but coincidentalbr br although theres nothing controversial about the overstuffed cast which seems to feature every actor of diverse genres looking for work at the time arthur kennedy jose ferrer martin balsam eli wallach john carradine and even early appearances by christopher walken jeff goldblum and nana visitor winner and company went back to bombastic basics and pulled a tod browningby enlisting reallife physicallychallenged actors to appear in the sentinels climactic everythingandeverybodygoestohell sequence which i guess any ballsy director would do finding himself unable to access linda blair and a case of greenpea soup it does definitely leave you with arctic fingers playing your spinal cord like a zither knowing this juicy little tidbit of info as you watch and it does feature a technique to which filmmakers have only begun to return very recently live onset makeup and special effects that dont involve cgi which was pretty much nonexistent back thenbr br the sentinel has that kitschy lateseventies cheese factor but does manage to distinguish itself from time to time with some gaspinducing moments like the one mentioned above not to mention that queasy feeling of dread that horror writers find it easy to play upon of isolation and things that go bumpandshriek in the night after all what livingsinglein thebigcity person hasnt lain in bed in the dark and listened intently to the sounds of what they hope is the building settlingbr br konvitz followed up the sentinel with an inevitable sequel the guardian not to be confused with the william friedkin supernatural thriller namesake that was never adapted for the screen sigh of relief
1,i got the dvd very cheap and im a total drewbie and thats probably the only constellation where this movie could ever interest anyonebr br an early drew movie shes looking great and she gets a quite lot of really cute scenes of her like a shower scene a sexy dance scene quite a number of sexy outfits etc she does never show the friendly charm we know from her more recent moviesbr br the movie itself is pretty average or subaverage and much more looking like being made for the tv than one for the cinema there is no real horror or tension built up and the dialogs are often cheesybr br the most interesting part is probably the end because i honestly dont understand it but maybe there is nothing to understand about it anyway but at least you dont get the end you would be expecting and it also comes much sooner than one would have expectedbr br overall i think this movie is exclusively for drewbies
0,you get writers together have each write a different story with a different genre and then you try to make one movie out of it its action its adventure its scifi its western its a mess sorry but this movie absolutely stinks 45 is giving it an awefully high rating that said its movies like this that make me think i could write movies and i can barely write
5,this movie is actually funny if youd like to rest your brain for an hour so then go ahead and watch it its called blonde and blonder so dont expect profound and meaningful jokes what this movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two blondes its just a funny movie to watch on a date or with a company of friends especially if youre not too sober lol  pamela and denise are still pretty hot chicks its a mistake to judge this movie as a piece of art cmon this movie is about blondes its supposed to be light funny and superficial one more thing i do not think that girls will appreciate and like this movie but guy definitely will
0,this has by far been one of the most beautiful portraits of a person that ive ever seen on screen andy goldsworthy is a kind of man that is upon extinction he views the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that its primitive in a good sense his purity honesty and kindness breathes clearly as you watch him work in such simplistic yet full of life momentary pieces of art i was amazed how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he accepted their end sometimes prematurely but his scottish sense of humor covers his disappointments brilliantly the film is shoot elegantly and contains the same flow that goldsworthys art has it combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself fred friths score is organic enough that it blends everything together without interfering with it naturalistic sound this is overall a great piece of work in every aspect it has no boundaries as far as age goes
6,its a good show and i find it funny finally the bad latin stereo types are over gracias seor lopez i love this show and i just started watching it about three months ago the whole concept about a latin family tv show really amazed me i am surprised that finally latinos have a good shot to be on tv this show is probably one the best ive seen its funny heartwarming touchy and nice
2,mardi gras made in china provides a wonderful intricate connection between popular culture nudity and globalization through the making and tossing of beads i saw this film at the international film festival of boston and was expecting a dry introduction to globalization but what i got was a riveting visual display of shocking footage from both china and the united states the eyeopening film is humorous indepth serious nonpatronizing and it leaves you wanting more as the credits role it is worth comparing to murderball  its simply that well done the young women workers in china have various points of view and the owner is amazingly open about the discipline the revelers during carnival are the highlight but only because this excellent film provides indepth context inside the factory in china without narration bravo to the filmmaker for getting inside and finishing the film i would have never thought about the connection between beads china and new orleans now i think about the human connection between almost every object but also the role of globalization inequality and fun more importantly i can make these connections without feeling a sense of guilt after watching this film unlike other films on globalization that ive seen
6,spoilerskhamosh is totally unrealistic lacks a plot and was basically only made to see stars portray themselves the most suspenseful scene in the movie was when shabana azmi is in the shower and then we see her tv playing the shower scene from psycho this movie actually expected users to believe that naseeruddin shahs character has a good enough memory to remember where certain shots were fired and how manybr br spoiler beginsbr br at the end the killer spills his guts to shabana azmi long enough to allow naseeruddin shahs character to run up and shoot himbr br spoiler endsbr br it is a little humorous only a little in the beginning to hear the director and cast members throwing insults at each other and hearing shabana azmi exclaim oh shtbr br overall a baaaaaaaaaaad moviebr br rating  out of  out of 10
5,apparently shakespeare equals high brow which equals in turn a bunch of folks not seeing something for what it really is at one point in this film someone i believe pacinos producer warns him that film is getting off track that it was once about how the masses think about shakespeare through the vehicle of richard iii instead he decides to shoot a chopped up play with random comments sprinkled throughout some scenes seemed to be included as home movies for al was there really any reason for the quick visit to shakespeares birthplace other than for a laugh about something unexpected which happens there and before the film has really even begun we are treated to seeing al prance around and act cute and funny for the camera i thought his silly act with kay near the end of godfather iii with the knife to his throat was an act  but apparently its how al really behaves in personbr br enough rambling heres a shotgun smattering of why i didnt even make it 34 of the way through this pretentious  al always knows when the camera is on him whether hes acting as richard or in a real conversation with someone  you can see it in the corner of his eyes also some of the actors around the rehearsal table become untethered and wax hammy to the extreme if anyone reading this has ever spent any time with an group of actors and has witnessed this kind of thing from the outside its unbearable look at me chewing all the scenery winona ryder when she appears as lady anne this film comes to a screeching halt which it never recovers from she has nothing to add in the discussion scenes but the camera lingers on her to bring in the kiddoes her performance is dreadful to boot the only things you really learn from this are told to you by the very scholars the filmmakers are trying to keep out of the picture of course you also learn that pacino shouldnt be directing films or doing richard in the first place id rather watch bobby deerfield than thisbr br lastly read the play and learn it for yourself go out and see it performed in 1997 i saw the play performed at the university of washington ethnic cultural theater and it made what we see in this film seem like high school drama except for the gratuitous throat slashing of clarence my god was that necessarybr br its all just a bunch of sound and fury signifying nada
4,worry not disney fansthis special edition dvd of the beloved cinderella wont turn into a pumpkin at the strike of midnight one of the most enduring animated films of all time the disneyfide adaptation of the gory brothers grimm fairy tale became a classic in its own right thanks to some memorable tunes including a dream is a wish your heart makes bibbidibobbidiboo and the title song and some endearingly cute comic relief the famous slipper click for larger image we all know the storythe wicked stepmother and stepsisters simply wont have it this uppity cinderella thinking shes going to a ball designed to find the handsome prince an appropriate sweetheart but perseverance animal buddies and a welltimed entrance by a fairy godmother make sure things turn out all right there are a few striking sequences of pure animationfor example cinderella is reflected in bubbles drifting through the airand the design is rich and evocative throughout its a simple story padded here agreeably with comic business particularly cinderellas rodent pals dressed up conspicuously like the dwarf sidekicks of another famous disney heroine and their misadventures with a wretched cat named lucifer theres also much harrumphing and exposition spouting by the king and the grand duke its a much simpler and more graceful work than the more frenetically paced animated films of today which makes it simultaneously quaint and highly gratifying
6,city hall takes on the politics of a city rather than country state or any sort of major political table granted it shines on new york city which is a huge political arena especially nowadays but it still goes for a smaller scale and puts the microscope on a few key players in a city wide scandal stumbled on by the mayors right hand director harold becker is a director very familiar with elements of the thriller having done mercury rising malice and domestic disturbance and i think in many ways he incorporates so many of the formulaic thriller genre that its almost to a fault i mean city hall is meant to be a political drama not a thriller but instead when all is said and done and once you get to the meat and potatoes of the film it feels and looks like a thriller but a decent one at that with very important part of the recipe that immediately makes it stand outwhat elseor rather who elseal pacino the film begins by giving you a really good look at life in the mayoral office and the inner workings of the city as the film continues it broadens its political spectrum to include a democratic boss and his connections and then we are introduced to some of the goings on within the city as events unfold a mystery begins and the political aspect is kind of left in the background but it still has a brilliant set upbr br i absolutely hate talking about al pacino i mean even if once he didnt give a good performance how could i ever say it the man is acting royalty there is just something brilliant about his entire demeanor in city hall pacino plays the new york city mayor he has a sense of duty and honor and immediately appears to be a very upstanding politician he also delivers one of the most powerful and outright engaging speeches ive ever seen at the james bone funeral i rewatched that speech four times and the first time i watched pacino give it my mouth gaped open and i almost wanted to stand up and applaud its brilliantly written and brilliantly delivered by pacino john cusack who i really do enjoy as an actor turns in a mediocre and overdone performance as the deputy mayor kevin calhoun he is kind of the focus of the film and him and pacino have good chemistry together when they are on screen but there is just something in this performancehe seems like hes trying too hard his accent is just bizarre and although he is supposed to be cutthroat and intimidating he doesnt get seem to pull it off maybe he was having an off film bridget fonda on her way out of her high point stardom does an okay job as attorney for police widows marybeth cogan her performance is very similar to cusacks in that she just doesnt seem to find her groove with this character danny aiello is terrific although his character is a little under explored as democratic boss with ties to the mafia frank anselmo martin landau makes a decent cameo as judge under scrutiny walter sternbr br the problem with city hall is evident in my review of the characters and actors everyone isokay there is a lot of back story that they try to bring out without actually showing it and it unfortunately leaves you just a little bit confused about the whole conspiracy and of course you have al pacino in a rather small supporting role but hes absolutely brilliant at it and outshines and overshadows every other actor in the film it almost feels like maybe they are intimidated by him being on screen with them so city hall could have been this huge political epic dramathriller but it felt cut and toned down to an average run of the mill one but it still has to be seen for pacino and a different spin on the inner working of politics if you just wont see this movie than find pacinos speech at james bone funeral because the word electrifying doesnt seem to give it justice but you can see what makes al pacino so incredible because in a mediocre film he pulls out this wallop of a speech and makes you feel it if youre a john cusack fan which i amhes definitely done better but he is the main character and all in all he does get his justice a decent movie but unfortunately potential loss 7510
2,it seems that the people behind envy realised that recent comedies  especially ones involving ben stiller and to a lesser degree jack black  have been situation spoofs which have steadily declined in originality and generally laughs i found the sheer absurdity of zoolander utterly hilarious when it was released starsky and hutch was also enjoyable and then dodgeball kept the laughs going for a lot of people although personally i was a bit tired of the overthetop characters  especially when the scenario wasnt quite so funny perhaps the comedy of a dodgeball tournament doesnt quite translate to australia where its rarely played so in an attempt to do something a little more original envy moves away from an absurd scenario and instead revolves around the absurd creation of jack blacks character i wont spoil what it is for those who intend to see the movie the problem is that the movie seems to drag im not a big enough movie buff to be able to think of examples but it seems like this set up has been done a thousand times before  and very rarely successfully so instead of a nice crisp enjoyable and fresh comedy you get a film that seems to just go through the motions sure the motions can be quite amusing and theyre centred on an idea that is quirky enough to provide a few laughs  especially with jack black playing the excited and amusing though a bit 2d creator ben stiller on the other hand seems a bit lost hes asked to play a fuller role than the ridiculous characters of his zoolander breed of movies but he struggles as a family man whether his fault or the scripts there isnt enough depth to the character and the result is a movie of ben stiller doing those typical mannerisms and generally becoming tedious the performance doesnt leave an imprint on the viewer hes just ben stiller jack black manages to actually portray a character  though not a challenging one the last annoying element of the movie is christopher walkens role as the j man which is about as typical and two dimensional as characters come and naturally he becomes monotonous and frustrating very quicklybr br its really not as unbearable as some people would have you think its watchable especially if youre in the right mood feeling silly would be a good prerequisite for seeing this film hire it on a movie night with friends and watch it after youve watched a scary film and feel like something light  hopefully youll also be somewhat tipsy by then too in that scenario i can imagine it would be quite enjoyable but generally it provides too few laughs to carry itself and most of the time just drags along
2,i admit that for the first 20 minutes or so of this film i wasnt entirely sure i was going to sit through the whole thing like many other people i found it pretty boring and i wasnt entirely looking forward to an hour and a half of watching this guy bite icicles and stick them together however if you sit through the creation of his first work long enough to see the finished product you get an idea of how impressive the rest of the film is i really think its sad that so many people found this impossibly boring or a retread of ideas done by other artists br br rivers and tides is a quiet study of some of the artwork and methods of andy goldsworthy who makes his art entirely out of things in nature generally resulting in pieces that will be consumed by nature through the normal process of entropy it is slow moving and unglamorous but i think that a lot of the point of the movie is to show that goldsworthys art does not need any accompaniment in order for it to be appreciated ive even heard people complain about how he is always talking throughout the movie rather than just letting nature and his artwork speak for themselves which i just think is madnessbr br on the other hand lots of people complain about cds coming with the lyrics written out inside them a lot of musicians as well think their music should mean whatever the listener wants it to mean without the musician showing the exact lyrics i guess im just the kind of person that believes that id like to know what the artist was trying to accomplish with his or her artwork i can still take it how i want to even if i know what it was meant to do i can understand not wanting to hear him talk through the movie he does after all lose his train of thought and find himself unable to explain some of his work at more than one occasion but if you dont want goldsworthy talk about his art while youre watching the film feel free to turn the sound off thats like not reading the lyrics if you dont want to know what a musician is singing and would rather interpret the words yourselfbr br i think that andy goldsworthys work which i had no idea existed before i watched this movie is incredibly impressive and im glad that this film was made in order to showcase it indeed since his work is generally not the kind that can be transported into a studio photography is the only medium other than film that can express it and i really appreciated being able to see the work that goes into his art and the way that only things from nature are used whether or not you appreciate certain aspects of how this film is presented goldsworthys work is moving enough to overlook that because the film is not the star goldsworthys art is and given the lack of any music or even the smallest special effects and the slowmoving nature of the film it seems to me that director thomas riedelsheimer knows that
3,george p cosmatos rambo first blood part ii is pure wishfulfillment the united states clearly didnt win the war in vietnam they caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the ohso innocent soldiers the only bad guys were the leaders of the nation who made this war happen the character of rambo is perfect to notice this he is extremely patriotic bemoans that usamericans didnt appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians like every film that defends the war eg we were soldiers also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in south asia and for that matter also the reason for every single usamerican soldier that was there instead rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation it would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories rather than suppressing them do we get to win this time yes you do
0,remember a film you seemed to enjoy in the past that doesnt quite meet those same feelings as an adult that occurred to me when i went back to schoolthe national lampoons class reunion the film has a perfect opportunity for laughs but surprisingly wanders aimlessly as we see a bizarre collection of characters such a woman who sold her soul to the devil and can shoot out flames of fire from her mouth a man who appears to be a vampire and a lunatic killer dressed as a woman and wears sacks over his head you have the class president who believes hes the best thing since sliced breadbut as we see in the film hes a coward and joke a couple of pot smokers who dont even know they are at their own class reunion and a man named gary for whom know one even knew existedand no one can seem to remember his namethis is the one running joke i enjoyed there is a plump pervert who likes to grab women in inappropriate places a deaf and blind woman who has a screeching holler when calling for her dog and the cookyou know her from goonies and throw mama from the trainwho loves to place food on peoples plates with her hands the film is essentially about a nutcase who isor at least attempting totaking revenge on his classmates for a gag they pulled on himthey arranged for him to sleep with his own twin sister the film follows the characters as they search for the killer canvasing darkened trashed hallways of the old high school they were told of the killer by his psychologist who seems a bit odd himself the film has a few good gags that workpretty much early on but the film slowly gets worse each passing minute the films true problem is that it really doesnt know where to go the film is pretty much a onejoke premise for it has unassured directionif it really has any direction at all the cast is enthusiastic enough but the material they are to make funny just doesnt have the quality to hold any interest its a curio for fans of early 80s comedy relics that are forgottenthis one rightfully so
3,hard to describe this one  if you were a fan of russ meyer films back in the day you will surely be pleased to see that haji is still looking really hot though forry ackerman has not fared so well what is he doing still making these movies anyway if i go up to him with a camera will he be in my movie it was a pretty fun premise  a superhero whose giant mammaries are her secret weapon  but sometimes it did not pan out for the whole length and the jokes were on a level with your average joe e brown comedy or abbott and costello if thats your thing  basically just bad puns still i found this movie fascinating to watch and for more than reasons good job but still a fundamentally flimsy production
4,this movie is really wack there is really nothing nice i can say about it besides the moral truth expressed in the films climax concerning people in the neighborhood participating in the fight against crime besides all that the film had nothing no good shots no good acting and no good script i give this film a f and a out 10
1,i was not really a big fan of star trek until past 23 years thanks to the advent of netflix and post 2000 video technology distribution i am able to embark into the past of all the great star trek episodes for those that dont really watch every single episode and know them by heart through tng ds9 voyager etc general popular consensus will say  i like the next generation the best thats because captain picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of star trek starvation but to be quiet honest i appreciate the creativity of voyagers episodes more than tng voyagers episodes also progresses through time unlike tng granted data from tng is great but it eventually gets old but voyagers doctor  now thats creativity instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky give him the freedom to express beyond anything you imagined not only is picardo such a great actor but the premise setting for his expansive self growth as a doctor self realization now that is science fiction at its best endgame portray him as a husband married to an organic inventing neuroimplant transceiver for humanmachine interface and even  in the episode before endgame to disobey captains order and make human mistakes unlike ds9 which are blessed with beautiful women right from 1st episode voyager has to survive seasons without jeri ryan and i believe it is picardo that carried them with his personality of course the rest of the voyagers cast chemistry just flows effortless harry kim and tom paris  very natural i love tuvoc occasional humor despite being a vulcan finally im so glad they got rid of that original female captain  oh if you get to watch the rare footage  thank god for kate she has developed through the years into an extremely confident believable and respectable female captain what a great job thank you star trek for making voyager i enjoy every episode the creative exploration of possibilities of morals and of our cosmic expanse
5,slow and riddled with inaccuracy overlooking its flaws this is still an interesting account of the famed and heroic siege of the alamo during the texas fight for independence from mexico james arness as jim bowie brian keith as davy crockett alec baldwin as col travis raul julia as general santa anna this madefortv project also stars david ogden stiers kathleen york and jim metzler very good original music by peter bernstein
5,more like psychological analysis of movies but psycho does sound better as a header the man in charge of the movie the narrator if you will does depict movies here in his own way most of them are classics but all of them are listed here at imdb and id strongly advise you to see them especially the hitchcock movies solyaris conversation  and the lynch movies because slavoj zizek will reference them br br or in other words he might spoil them for you i dont remember if he spoiled more than those ive listed i think the chaplin movies too but as i wrote itd be best if you watch them all beforehand in the imdb listing there is a movie missing that i did report to them so it might get up there pretty soon its a meg ryan movie but its a only a brief snippet not big of a deal anywaysbr br zizek views and opinions are crazy and fun to listen to if youre open minded to see things through another perspective even if that does destroy your favorite movie a bit for you  it doesnt mean it will do that but it could
1,antonioni by making this film had assumed the role of papa smurf to all the little longhaired american radical studentsmurfs he had taken them under the guiding protection of his european communist wings showing appreciation and support for their confused american ways these smurfs are red and wear blue not the other way around the radical smurfs were happy to get the guidance of a wise old man with gray hair who regularly preys to the god of all longhaired smurfs lenin the communist  another wise old man whose beard made the smurfs take him even more seriously for it symbolized something wise though they did not quite know why they regarded the beard to have this kind of deep effect on them castro another wise bearded man has often profited from this confusion and exuded magical powers with his beard over his naive overseas admirers not to mention che guevara that beard has a certain jenesaispasquoi about it makes one want to immediately embrace marx and his lovely pacifistic teachings the film starts with a muddled meeting of radically stupid radical students who engage in dialogues that truly redefine the word confused as confused as a blindfolded dog falling of a highstory building into a bottomless pit suddenly the movies hero well antonionis hero rises up and says something to his pathetic leftwing peers and then leaves hoping that this display of megacoolness will improve his james dean image and vastly increase his chances of getting laid with the best chicks in the next mass hippie orgy eventually he gets into trouble with cops ie pigs at a rally and spends the movie under the blue american capitalist skies looking for freedom or something like thatbr br antonionis predictable assault on capitalism is not only intellectually hollow but has or had nothing new to offer its just the same old triggerhappy onedimensional cops businessmen discussing business deals and whats wrong with that isnt that how antonionis movies get made and endless shots of tv commercials and billboards advertising the ohso morally decadent products for the abhorrent selfish and greedy rightwing rabblepopulation who thinks of no one but themselves their families their work and their childrenbr br papa smurf antonioni just like his longhaired smurfs and smurfettes of the late 60s failed to notice the most obvious and vital aspect about their silly movement they were allowed to have their laughable meetings and express their antiestablishment opinions freely within that very establishment whereas the students in those countries whose leftwing systems they admired did not and still do not by far the greatest irony about the hippies  and antonioni naturally failed to realize this as well his judgment being clouded by cocainesnorting and an excessive intake of lsd  is that hippies were are the garbageresidue of capitalism this is an incredible irony only in a successfullyfunctioning capitalist system can you find that species called hippie a spoiled ungrateful and selfish bunch of middle and uppermiddle class losersbr br the film itself seems to go on forever antonioni takes his sweet time with getting on with it while including overlong scenes of pointlessness with a high dullness factor his attempts at symbolism are annoying and trite his statements are highly dubious at best this film is antonionis way of saying that violent revolution is the solution and this is what we get from an old saturated filthyrich fat filmmaker who lives in villas and dines in the best french and italian restaurantsbr br i dont remember seeing any major western movie about the tiananmen massacre of thousands of students in china but when one western student gets shot for waving che guevaras face into all our faces we get ten major films about it at once i suppose this means that a chinese life is worth a thousand times less than a western one  at least to the leftwing hypocrites who infest moviesbr br if youre a marxist neohippy and disliked this awful review please klick no below
4,sweet and charming funny and poignant plot less but meaningful before sunrise 1995 the third movie of richard linklater is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love is in love or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it it is one of the very rare movies that isshouldwill be equally interesting to teenagers their parents and even grandparents it seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects car chases or long and steamy sex scenes two young people in their early 20s two college students american tourist ethan hawke who is returning home after the summer in europe and the french student julie delpy who goes to paris to attend the classes in sorbonne meet on a train they are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking they hop off the train in vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night they talk and fall in love thats it thats the movie it couldve been boring and silly but instead it is a lovely believable clever and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing at least for this viewer high praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters superb writing always interesting and witty dialogs two awesome performances and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is julie delpy who looks like a botticellis angel is great in portraying smart independent and incredibly attractive young woman
4,dragonlord sees chan returning to his role of dragon from the young master not much has carried over from the first film though tiger his older brother is nowhere to be seen neither is the marshall his daughter or his son played superbly by yuen biao in the original film dragon does have the same master though  presumably all the other students have moved on to other things dragons laziness at training is portrayed heavily in this film so maybe hes still studying br br originally titled young master in love this film sees dragon for the first sixty minutes at least pursuing a villager girl in various idiotic and slapstick ways his rival for her affection is his friend inappropriately named cowboy played comically by the longtime chan stuntteam member mars we see various scenes where their silly schemes backfire it is one of these scenes that we thankfully find dragon in over his headbr br this film is notorious in that it failed expectations at the box office that said im sure the expectations were pretty high and i feel that this film has never had a fair judgment based on its own merits but even when i try to do this i still feel that there is a problem with the film it seems quite unfocused sometimes rushed and i think the action is too sporadic and not as brilliant as chans other work from this periodbr br the thing that really saves the film is the ending sequence as in the young master there is a fantastic final reel that it full of incredibly exhausting action  you really feel every blow and again chan goes up against the same rival from the young master is it the same character and the timing and energy here is brilliant chans style of using every last bit of his environment to help defeat his opponent  not just relying on pure physical ability  is as apparent here as anywhere else the barn they fight in is full of clever little prop gags and improvisations this is an absolute highlight of the film and one of chans incredible careerbr br its not necessary to see the prequel before seeing dragonlord in fact it might even raise more questions than what it hopes to answer but it must be said that the original film is the superior film and dragonlord with its focus on girlchasing and teamsports does seem baffling luckily the few fight scenes it offers plus a fantastic shuttlecock scene push it over the line as a mustsee film in this genre
5,having seen and loved greg lombardos most recent film knots he cowrote and directed that feature as well i decided to check out his earlier work and this movie was well worth the effort and rental macbeth in manhattan is a tongue in cheek excellent take on the shakespeare favorite updated and moved to nyc i was impressed by the underlying wit and intelligence of the script and was wowed by the way the storyline of the production in the movie mirrors the storyline of the play itself  and very cleverly at that the trials and tribulations of life in manhattan parallel many a shakespeare play and central park was rarely put to better use than as the woods around macbeths castle mr lombardo obviously has a fond place in his heart for new york and new york stories knots is a funny and warm sex comedy about six thirtysomething new yorkers set primarily in a charming brooklyn neighborhood with manhattan offices and a downtown loft thrown in for good measure and has spent considerable time around the plays of shakespeare the movie is wellpaced and the story reflects a deep understanding of the essential drama at the core of macbeth it reminded me of al pacinos looking for richard  another wonderful shakespeare play within a movie i highly recommend checking out macbeth in manhattan
0,this movie is the best film ever i cant remember the last time a movie has drawn tears out of me with a tear in my eye i admire this movie it has all the elements that a good movie must have excellent dialogues music acting storyplot a story of friendship courage kindliness and loyalty between a street performing who famous to the king of masks and a little girl that sold as a boy in serf bazaar little girl liked to be his granddaughter and king of masks liked a grandson they were not conventional in real every scene they were together was priceless the camera work is flawless and grips you the acting is inspired xu zhu was excellent as the king of masks renying zhou doggie looks pretty and played her character very well zhigang zhao as liang sao lang was great he played his helpful and kindhearted character extremely well if you havet this movie try it once do watch it
7,or at least one of the best i think this is a very fun and very cool game for the n64 bowser is up to his usual shenanigans yeah its a dumb word but the only one i can think of and mario must stop him again this game is very fun to play and contains lots of nostalgia to me the only bad thing about it is the graphics which are awful to todays standards but everything else is pretty good especially the little minigames you can unlock its the second best n64 game the first best is conkers bad fur day that i recommend to any mario fan or any fan of platform games it beats out mediocre super mario sunshine any daybr br 910 or a
1,if the makers of atlantis had something to say in this film its theme was literally drowned out by the emphasis on special effects over characterization almost as if in an attempt to keep up with the rest of the summer action blockbusters disney has ditched the characterdriven moviewithamessage approach in favor of a star wars shootemup with stereotype heroes and villainsbr br the art is cartoony and the producers think that they can rely on computer generated images cgi of flying fishcraft and submarines to fill the gap they are wrong and the days of beautiful handcrafted animation is fast flying out the window in favor of assemblyline cgibr br this movie is all spectacle with no heart at times the film comes close to being a good worthwhile movie but frustratingly misses the mark so many times by copping out of talking about something meaningful and instead choosing to go with the glitzbr br another problem with the movie is the pacing it starts confusingly and then begins to rocket along with a choppy story editing style that is not appreciated the viewer is rushed out of the door along with milo thatch voiced well by michael j fox and is left thinking gee there must be an awful lot of stuff thats going to happen once we get to atlantis unfortunately not much happens the secret of atlantis remains a secret with the storytellers not really knowing how to explain the legendary islandcontinent they are afraid to commit to saying where atlantis is even in a fictional story is it in the atlantic is it in the mediterranean sea who knows nothing is hypothesized even from a purely fantasybased point of view the viewer will leave the theatre asking themselves now what was that all about what was the point of the movie why couldnt the surviving atlanteans remember how to read when many of them lived through the disaster to the present day and why did atlantis sink and then promptly begin to forget about what they saw there is nothing left to think about or mill over except the loss of money in their walletsbr br the characters and their motivations are equally unfathomable from the eccentric zillionaire who founds the expedition with seemingly more money that existed on the entire planet in 1914 to the spoiler collective consciousness that enters kida and voluntarily deserts its people the crew are a collection of quirky 2dimensional people of anachronistically for 1914 pc race and gender the demolitions expert talks like he came right out of a warner brothers bugs bunny short most of the jokes are gross oneliners that are largely missed by the audience for two reasons they are delivered at lightningspeed pacing and usually mumbled the way these supporting players do a moral turnaround near the end of the movie is hard to believebr br while we applaud disney for trying to create animated movies for adults  and this is the first disney not to have cute talking animals or objects  it fails to make the transition younger children will be frightened by some of the action scenes and be left in the dark by the large amount of subtitles when the characters speak atlantean in the first five minutes of the expedition approximately 200 people are killed without a second thought obviously disney thinks that if you didnt know who those people were then why should you care again the movie has no feelings on any levelbr br mulan and tarzan were the last animated movies produced by disney that were done extremely well sadly atlantis harkens back to those failed attempts in the past such as the black cauldron and hunchback of notre dame disney needs to get back to their roots a sequel to peter pan is coming out shortly but one never knows what the results will be until you see it for yourself and now that disney has discovered science fiction one hopes that they will realize that that genre must have more than spectacle to it we also hope that the upcoming treasure planet a scifi adaptation of robert l stevensons treasure island will have more heart to it than the unfathomable atlantis the lost empire
1,i am a guy who loves guy movies i was looking forward to seeing a dragon fighting with the army with cool special effects all of this happened however this movie was the worst movie i have ever seen in my lifebr br the story was standard but the portrayal of the story was terrible the scene transitions were the worst i have ever seen why would you walk out to a beach to relax if your life was in danger the serpent dragons actions itself was very poorly written and the serpent dragons attack capabilities varied widely throughout the movie several times the main characters should have diedbr br the director attempted to infuse a love story in the middle of the movie during the most stressful times this movie was obviously not watched after it was made i love movies but had to force myself to finish watching it thank god i did not buy this i borrowed it from a friendbr br do not buy this do not rent it just watch discovery channel much more exciting
0,i cant quite say that jerry springerringmaster is the worst film i have ever seen the film would be better off if it were because at least the worst film ive ever seen prom night ii interested me enough for me to hate it my only reaction after leaving the theatre happened when i looked up at the clock and discovered that only 90 minutes had passed it had seemed much more like years it is an endless repetition of poor people or what jerry springer seems to believe poor people are screwing each other hitting each other insulting each other and then repeating the process with the same attention to duty the rest of us use when shampooing the plot which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to provide grist for the jerry springer mill advances solely because of the idiocy of the characters this makes it impossible to care what happens to them it never mattered to me whether they got on the show or what they said or who slept with whom maybe im not supposed to care about them maybe im supposed to look at them as some kind of comic type to see their outrageous behavior as inherently funny too bad it isnt the humor is not outrageous its innocuous its predictable humor has to have something behind it some kind of painful irony or life experience in order to function scatology is not wit an example a mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed to take revenge she marches across the trailer park and gives oral sex to her daughters boyfriend since i was over the shock of jerry springers show a long time ago i had the same reaction i had to andrew dice clays obscene nursery rhymes not laughter just yawning lastly i found springers pose as a populist tiresome and unconvincing if he really were an advocate of the poor he would bring on a single mom from bedsty to talk about trying to raise her kids in new york city on 12000 a year or failing that he would at least give the participants of his shows a cut of his profits jerry springer gets millions for his shows his movie his book and videos his guests just get round trip air fare hotel accommodations and a chance to humiliate themselves if he liked poor people so much hed give them at least some of the money they earn for him it appears that springer wanted to make this movie to grab some legitimacy for himself jeez with all his fine work youd think hed have earned our respect already anyway the film is weak and boring it doesnt even succeed at being offensive if you want to have a better evening videotape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that
7,the house of the spirits is a gripping tale of family intrigue south american politics and supernatural powers meryl streep glenn close and jeremy irons bring isabel allendes novel to life with all its passion and suspense this in my view is one of the best films of the 1990s jeremy irons as esteban trueba ages and mellows very believably while meryl streep in the role of clara maintains her gentle loving warmth throughout her relatively short life winona ryder and antonio banderas make a handsome couple struggling for family acceptance in a racist culture glenn close as estebans sister gives a very moving performance the countryside of portugal is a reasonable substitute for a nontropical latin american country settings of claras home and estebans ranch are effective and the period us cars add nicely to the postwar atmosphere
0,finally was there released a good modesty blaise movie which not only tells a story but actually tells the real story i admit that it is a bad movie if you expect an action thriller but if you stop in your track and remove all your expectations then you will notice that it is a story that comes very close to the original made by peter odonnell you have a cover story just to tell about how modesty became the magnificent person which she is it is not a movie to attract new fans but a movie to tell the real tale some things could have been better but when you cannot forget the awful movie from 66 then is this a magnificent movie so are you a fan then sit down relax and just enjoy that the real story is there with a cover story just to make modesty tell her story
4,i rarely write a negative review for this site but this time felt complied to night listener is without doubt one of the dullest films i have ever seenbr br there was nothing happening in this film what so ever  i didnt care for any of the characters didnt buy in to the whole mystery type plot didnt care how it endednothingbr br there is no comedy no action no thrills no suspense nothing the highlights include no spoilers  theres nothing to spoil a man climbing through a window a dog barking outside a hotel room a car going over some rough ground and a truck beeping its hornbr br i really enjoyed one hour photo and hoped for a similar eerie role from williams but alas was sorely let down whats more disappointing is that im sure there is a good film in there somewhere  the idea was interesting and i should have felt sympathy for the characters but it just didnt work for mebr br i might even have given it 110 but that score is reserved for the remake of the producers
6,answer despite that fact that this film was written and directed by a woman your ex is creepier nastier and more irrational than any zombie that ever lurched the earthbr br the acting in this independent film actually is quite good despite the lessthanwonderful script it takes a pretty good actor to deliver an overwritten clichd line and make it sound vaguely believable young anthony de marco as jake puts in a particularly good performancebr br fortunately the plot of this film is a lot better than the dialog try it especially if youre not a monster fan this is not a horror flick even though all the adult females are pretty monstrous and although all the adult males act as if their brains were eaten in some earlier zombie film jakes closet is suitable for mature adultsbr br the whole this time is much better than the sum of its parts
0,this is not an entirely bad movie the plot new house built next door seems to be haunted is not bad the mood is creepy enough and the acting is okay the big problem i had is that being familiar with lara flynn boyle from twin peaks and other shows i couldnt get over how different she looks with her apparently new big lips i kept staring at them they look so out of place on her face they make her look completely different and not betterbr br markpaul gosselaar the actor who plays kim the architect who designs and pours his heart and soul into the house does a fine job and lara as col is also quite good but those lips as the owner of the house next door her husband walker colin ferguson is appropriately wooden the various characters who live in the house were also fine i particularly liked pie charlotte sullivan and her husband buddy stephen amell the first people to move into the house the attempt to involve us in the overall neighborhood vibe fails unfortunately as the other neighbors are not particularly likablebr br for some reason the director was unable to make the haunted house particularly ominous other movies such as amityville horror the legend of hell house manage to achieve that spooky feel but it just doesnt happen here the closest is when col paints a depiction of the housebr br another thing that didnt work for me is the plot twist that occurs with kim the architect initially he appears to be a victim of the house like the others it has sucked him dry of inspiration but later he seems to have joined forces with it in evilbr br overall not a bad movie for horror fans if you can take your eyes off those big lips

0,tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a kid i used to borrow the books from the school library every chance i got my favorite one was the red sea sharks  so much action and humorbr br this documentary was a brilliant exposition of the background story of herge and his development of tintin the filmmakers personal experience in interviewing herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who was the inspiration for the chan character was very movingbr br a great documentary of a very talented and wellloved artist a great example of someone who has become internationally renown and has brought joy of millions of children and the young at heart all over the world
7,i was expecting a lot better from the battlestar galactica franchise very boring prequel to the main series after the first 30 minutes i was waiting for it to end the characters do a lot of talking about religion computers programming retribution etc there are gangsters mafia types who carry out hits however caprica doesnt have the action of the original series to offset the slower partsbr br let me give you some helpful advice when viewing movies as a general rule if there is a lot of excessive exploitive titillation then you know the movie will be a dud caprica has lots of this the directorwriter usually attempts to compensate for his poor abilities by throwing in a few naked bodies it never works and all it does is demean the very young actresses involved and i feel sorry for them directorswriters who do this should be banned from the businessbr br if you want to be bored for an hour and a half by all means rent caprica theres free porn on the net if you really want to see naked bodies otherwise move along nothing to see here
1,br br i saw the glacier fox in the theatre when i was nine years old  i bugged my parents to take me back three times i began looking for it on video about five years ago finally uncovering a copy on an online auction site but i would love to see it either picked up by a new distributor and rereleased i understand the original video run was small or have the rights purchased by the family channel disney etc and shown regularly it is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life struggle of a family of foxes in northern japan narrated by a wise old tree the excellent soundtrack compliments the film well it would be a good seller today better than many of the weak offerings to childrens movies today
5,as many agree origin is a beautiful anime artistically the music graphics and the world created are gorgeous and it really stands above most other modern animated works however if you are looking for more than this than i suggest looking else where the beauty stops short of its appearance and when it really comes down to plot and characters theres nothing special action is slow and minimal and the people are flat corny at times and do not act realistically not to mention the plot hole here and the plot hole there so in summary oh my goodness ive never seen an anime as beautiful as this one and oh my goodness its like poke people dont act like that it took a giant step forward in graphics and music in anime but it also took a few step backs to times of bad characterization and unfortunately theres not even that much action to make up for that
0,at one end of the eighties warren beatty created and starred in the literate epic reds about the founding of the soviet union as seen through the eyes of iconoclast radical john reed it was a profound film both entertaining and with a message presented by an all star cast at the end of the decade warren beatty created another kind of epic in dick tracy that makes no pretense to being anything other than entertainment with a whole bunch of the best actors around just having a great old time hamming it up under tons of makeupbr br that both reds and dick tracy could come from the same individual speaks volumes about the range this man has as a player in this film beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters from the strip and put them in one original screenplaybr br the citys top mobster big boy caprice is making a move to really eliminate competition the film opens with him rubbing out lips manliss henchmen in a valentine massacre style shooting and then lips himself being fitted for a cement overcoat but caprices moves are making him a target for tracybr br in the meantime a third mysterious and faceless individual is looking to topple caprice himself will our hero sort out this thicket of crimebr br the spirit of fun this film has is truly infectious when people like al pacino dustin hoffman paul sorvino william forsythe rg armstrong get themselves outrageously madeup to look like the cartoon creations of strip author chester gould and then indulge in an exercise of carving the biggest slice of ham youve got to love this filmbr br al pacino got a nomination for best supporting actor but any of these guys could have its only that pacino as big boy caprice gets the most screen time only beatty plays it completely straight the others all seem to play off of him dick tracy won oscars for best artset design best song written by stephen sondheim and introduced by madonna sooner or later the fact he was even able to get somebody like sondheim to write a score for this film only shows sondheim wanted to get in on the fun as for madonna the material girl does more than hold her own with all these acting heavyweights as club torch singer breathless mahoneybr br before this film dick tracy movies were consigned to the b pictures and worse as saturday afternoon serials the only thing that rivals this all star extravaganza is a radio broadcast done for armed forces radio during world war ii that got to vinyl can you believe a cast like bing crosby bob hope frank sinatra dinah shore jimmy durante judy garland frank morgan and the andrews sisters try and find a recording of that gembr br until then warren beattys classic comic strip for the big screen will do nicely
6,in the seemingly endless quest to find well made well acted horror films it is alltoorare to find one that even comes remotely close to hitting the mark needless to say i was very pleasantly surprised when i stumbled across burned at the stake on a us cable network while i was flipping channels the premise is reasonably simple in 1692 young ann putnam swift is the most vocal witness against alleged witches leveling baseless charges against anyone who earns her displeasure manipulating her for his own ends is reverend parris peters who also serves as the courts guide on matters pertaining to witchcraft and satanism things get complicated when ann starts accusing members of the goode family of witchcraft salem of 1980 or so loreen graham also played by swift begins having unusual visions shortly before she visits the salem witch museum a strange man in seventeenth century garb tries to accost her there and the building he continues to stalk her while strange phenomena begin to involve her more and more soon it appears that she is becoming possessed by the spirit of ann putnam unfortunately further description gets rather involved and would give too much away though the film is not actionoriented and would likely be of little interest to many viewers the performances are good and the seventeenth century dialogue used in the films many flashbacks sounds very convincing the production values are solid with the possible exception of some of the special effects in a sidenote the films technical advisor was laurie cabot salems official witch viewers who appreciate a wellmade atmospheric but understated horror film may appreciate this the writerdirector bert i gordon has had a long career in horror and science fiction filmmaking and is best known for his work on a number of big bug films and similar works years earlier
1,i cant say im all that experienced in misty mundae flicks having seen only a handful but its obvious that this was made on a shoestring and while it might have been respectable that the filmmakers were able to make a tomb raider ripoff inside a garage it isnt because its completely obvious that this is what they were doing the film only runs for forty five minutes and this is definitely a good thing as there isnt nearly enough plot here to stretch it out for any longer it has something to do with an evil nazi scientist who looks about as evil as a porn star playing a nazi scientist ever could a mummy which is clearly a man wrapped up in toilet roll and misty  this films version of tomb raider who keeps her top on for much less time than angelina jolie did in the big budget version i have to say that even in spite of its shortcomings this film could have been better its got misty mundae for a start and even better than that if you ask me is the fact that it also stars the even hotter darian caine the pair gets to engage in all the lesbian sex that you would expect from a seduction cinema film and this is at the expense of the nonexistent plot although that isnt really a bad thing obviously this is a rubbish film  but the fact that its short is to its credit and if youre after a bit of lesbian sex you could do worse
7,a wonder one of the best musicals ever the three busby berkely numbers that end the movie are spectacular but what makes this film so wonderful is the incredible nonstop patter and the natural acting of cagney and blondell keeler is also lovely even though she may not have been a great actress theres a freshness in the movie that you dont see in flicks today much less in the usually stilted 30s films even though the plot involving the setting up of movies prologues is quite dated
0,the lion king 12 is a very cute story to go along with the lion king it basically follows the original story of the lion king but with a couple of twists in the moviee vents are explained by a different characters point of view this story is still an original plotbr br as far as sequels go disney isnt all that great at making worthwhile ones this one being the third part to the lion king simbas pride is the second actually has an original idea to it while still involving the fun of the first timon and pumbaa travel along looking for the ideal place to live after searching far and wide they find the place of hakuna matata they then meet a small lion named simba and go through many things that parents today go throughbr br i think this is a very good movie and im happy to add it to my collection
2,when i first saw this show i thought it looked interesting i watched it saw how it revolved around sarah like the character sees the worldrevolving around her i got it but wasnt laughing very muchbr br onstage and in her show shes racist crude insensitive and hugely selfcentered i didnt get her at first and took it all at face value then i got to see her movie jesus is magic i think that served as a sarah silverman primer for me explaining to me just what language shes speaking shes like marilyn manson working so hard to give us a faceful of horrible ideas and images but you eventually realise it isnt an assault its a statement and once you understand that you find youre glad someones finally giving it to you straightbr br i dont mean to suggest only smart people will understand or that to hate this show is to prove your idiocy while i like a lot of smart shows i still to this day do not see the humor of curb your enthusiasm i get the impression that its good but i just dont get it many people will never get the sarah silverman program but im glad i eventually came aroundbr br the creators of this show do work hard every episode is loaded not just with dialogue and plot but with songs or dream sequences production numbers these people arent putting together something to fill a time slot and please advertisers they appear to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together if i was to predict the future of this show id say it will go the way of arrested development and freaks  geeks it will get canceled before its time and live on in fans hearts and on dvd but take heart ssp creators your audience is out there and well be watching for as long as they let you make the show
6,chilling majestic piece of cinematic fright this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot an icecold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization this movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a redpoker through a human eye as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems one of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind the setting is perfect in a desolate winter hideaway the quietness of the moment is a character in itself as the fermenting aggressor in jack torrances mind wallows in this idle time and breeds the devils new playground i always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds with only the circumstances of the moment and the reasons given therein needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims this film is a perfect example of this very thoughtbr br and it is within this films subtle touches of the canvas the clackityclacks of the young boys big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel the labyrinthian garden representing the minds fine line between sane and insane kubricks purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies continuity errors and set misarrangements that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown i have never read the book upon which the film is based but without that as a comparison point i am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that i have ever seen i thought that the runtime of the film couldve been cut by a little bit but then again i am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film so maybe i should keep my twocent criticisms over a superb film to myself all in all this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its coldeyed view of the mans mind gone overboard creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanitybr br rating 910
1,thought at first this film would be your typical western film however it turned out to be very interesting and kept me spellbound right to the very end which turned out very unusual charlton hestonsam burgademidway76 had past experiences with james coburnzach provodeadfall93 and zach never forgave sam and would stop at nothing to make sure he caught up with him and paid him back unfortunately barbara hersheysusan burgadethe portrait of a lady96 managed to get caught up in this situation and found herself among sex starved men who never seemed to leave her alone sam burgade had to make some very hard decisions and and i was quite surprised at the conclusion this is a very entertaining film and the acting was outstanding
1,this was the first movie that joan crawford and clark gable made together and they would go on to make several more crawford stars a young rich girl whos father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother they have never worked before and the brother william bakewell gets a job with gable who is a gangster and bakewell thinks it will be an easy job but gets in over his head pretty quick crawford becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on their is a massacre in which several of gables men are killed and crawford was a witness to the whole thing its a good movie but not one of their best
7,this movie is among my favorite foreign films some of the others are amilee and my life as a dog the similarities with those movies as with so many great foreign films is that it takes a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a profound heartfelt lesson br br in japan a man who is bored with his mundane life and the rut of his married life sees a beautiful japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio in the instant that it takes his train to pass he is enthralled by her but is it only by her beauty by her faraway glance or a connection that they will both discover that they share br br shall we dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance breaking traditional moulds and stereo types of japanese society they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away it is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and in itself transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be
1,i really loved this version of emma the best kate beckinsale was awesome as emma and mark strong was very good as knightly the only complaint that i had was on mr woodhousei cant believe that a man could whine so much or be so selfish with his daughters lifeshe was a smart girl in the end though as always i love the places in which these jane austin movies were shot the settings are so spectular it makes me want to visit england so much 9as well as ireland and scotland i think the actors chosen for this movie were a good choice as well and all the other story lines interwhined with emmas most excellently i am glad that i got to see this one as well
2,blonde and blonder has pamela anderson and denise richards in almost every scene and if you want more from a movie youre being utterly unreasonable it feels like a late era carry on when the series was no longer blazing trails but was still more funny than not think behind or england and you wont be too far off the mark pamela and denise are bubbly charming and clearly aware this isnt a masterpiece theyre making although you can give me it over lots of things im told to like the supporting cast are energetic even if some of them arent particularly good i cant see a couple of duff turns in a movie thats already practically forgotten making much difference to anything so just smile i really do think blonde and blonder is ace and i hope you hate me for it
1,not only do the storylines in the sopranos engage audiences from all over but i think for me at least what brings the viewers back is the acting not even you gary can dispute that claim james gandolfini who plays the leadman tony soprano has become in this viewers opinion one of the hollywood elites as far as acting in a television series goes i wouldnt go ahead and compare him with robert deniro or al pacino or at least not just yet he however does do a hell of a job playing the part of tony soprano in the years since 1999 gandolfini has risen so much so as an actor mainly thanks to his role in the sopranos that today he is considered to be among the best in the business and its not just him the sopranos fields a great supporting cast including that of lorraine bracco edie falco michael imperioli dominic chianese and the late nancy marchand who played tonys dreadful mother at this point in the shows existence its being considered a cultclassic and rightfully so the first two seasons were extraordinary violent and quite gruesome in a pretty frequent manner but without a doubt extraordinarily done the third season was great but didnt quite live up to the hype of seasons and season which wrapped up right before newyears was the weakest season yet or at least in my opinion it was despite a dryspell i still found it season of the sopranos to be more entertaining than most of its competition and thats saying a lot because lately ive been noticing a trend in good new television shows examples of this six feet under the shield curb your enthusiasm and oz which is not technically a new show but ended with an unforgettable final season this year to get back to my point though to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year no less is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers the sopranos ranks above and beyond all other television shows in its era and its writers deserve a lot of credit to close id like to say the sopranos is the real deal folks for the average mature viewer 17 and above who enjoys drama and doesnt mind a mixing of a little violence and profanity you might want to check out the sopranos if you get the chance trust me in that it will be well worth the time
3,this movie is probably the worst i have seen bad acting bad script bad everything comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting both cyborg van damme 1989 and nemesis olivier gruner 1993 are much better and seems more robust in both story and directing and still its albert pyun who has directed these two as wellbr br the story is not original the world has become a terrible place possibly due to an environmental disaster or a nuclear war and people live under medieval circumstances a special breed of robots cyborgs live on human blood and theres the story the cyborgs need to get a lot of humans to fulfill there prophecy and the humans need someone to stop them one girl together with a robot kris kristofferson built by the creator of the cyborgs has been appointed by destiny to save mankindbr br in this movie the director tries some hongkong stylish fighting scenes with the participants flying high and leaping far the movie fails miserably in this attemptbr br i recommend this film with the only reason that most people will get a new worst ever movie to relate to and to fans of the genre i recommend cyborg since i think its a very underestimated movie with quite a high entertaining factor and if you cant stand van damme then check out nemesisbr br i rated this movie 110
0,if youre a fan of gothic horror then youre definitely absolutely guaranteed to love this wondrous italian 60s film castle of blood were really talking about creepily creaking doors eerie portraits that appear to be moving spontaneously dying candles although theres no wind and smoke coming from underneath heavy wooden chamber doors speaking in terms of atmosphere and style this masterful piece of gothic filmmaking is one of the best out there just one tiny league below landmarks such as black sunday the three faces of fear and curse of the crying woman the prominent directors duo sergio corbucci the great silence django and antonio margheriti cannibal apocalypse killer fish are successful in all areas including a powerful plot one that is genuinely nightmare inducing ultrasinister scenery and filming locations stylish black and white photography spinechilling music and a brilliant gathering of talented performers barbara steele starlet of the aforementioned black sunday and italian gothmuse number one shines brightly again as a spiritually tormented character and shes literally surrounded by excellent coplayers one of them silvano tranquilli even gives away a fairly credential depiction of author edgar allan poe the story involves him and another wealthy visitor of a countryside tavern challenging a brutal young journalist to accept a morbid wager if he  alan foster  would survive spending one night in the infamous blackwood castle he receives the astonishing reward of 10 and a newspaper interview with poe needless to say the ordeal is much more dangerous than it sounds even for somebody like alan foster whos a firm nonbeliever in ghosts and vampires the night starts out great for him as he even meets up with the stunningly beautiful woman of his dreams but gradually he learns that blackwood castle is a hellish place where the ghosts of the previously deceased visitors are trapped for all eternity i dont know about you but this is seriously one of my favorite horror movie premises of all time codirector antonio margheriti clearly was proud of this film as well because he remade it himself a couple of years later as web of the spider that movie had a handful of trumps like for example the casting of no less than klaus kinski in the role of edgar allan poe but in general this original is vastly superior castle of blood literally oozes with atmosphere and maintains a thoroughly unsettling ambiance throughout this truly is one of the rare films that can make the hair on your arms and back of the neck rise with fear if you watch it in the right circumstances watch it late at night preferably alone and in a candle lit room and youll get an idea about the true definition of horror
1,how did i ever appreciate this dud of a sequel all it does is throw balls worst of all it doesnt compare to even the first installment of the series the comedy suffers from not being funny where did all the unintentional laughter go enough slapstick onthefield action goes on too long bob uecker literally saved this one from a complete nineinning shutout whats next major league return to the little league ehh could be leave this one on the shelf and plan a trip to the allstar game this ones had three strikes too many
5,this film has a clear storyline which is quite unusual to the musical genre cats phantom of the opera and other andrew lloyd webbers musicals can be considered metaphorical as they use literary works as their framework biarkan bintang menari bbms storyline touches the very core of human relationships especially that of indonesian people despite the fact the film was based on a supposedly fairytale its actually a fantasy of the child in indonesian adults the dance sequences are not perfect yet the songs represent how indonesians express themselves i reckon the choreographer should explore indonesian way of dancing by not dismaying the fact that indonesias dance development tends to be more westernized the dance sequences seem awkward in some ways and not synchronized with the songs andor music yet i still love this movie and regard it as a new wave of indonesian film genre which i hope to improve in the future
2,it sounds as if it should be a biography of claude monet but its actually a highly focused story of relationships between three adolescent girls on a french synchronized swimming team there are no parents or teachers to speak of no school and boys are represented by one peripheral figure the hunky francois who enters the story determined from time to time and always leaves confusedbr br pauline aquart is the youngest of the three only aspiring to join the team she so much admires shes kind of odd looking shes not yet out of her adolescent growth spurt and has long bony limbs big feet and no derriere to speak of shes prognathous and sports these plump pursed lips after a while her appearance grows on you and from certain angles she can come to appear enthrallingbr br adele haenel is older  more well more developed physically what a glamorous figure she cuts in her swim suit sauntering around teasing the boys swishing her long blond hair but shes not what she seems or is she i couldnt quite figure it out the french are long on paradoxes and short on consistency no wonder francois is always sniffing after herbr br theres not so much ambiguity in louse blacheres character shes on the team too but shes dumpy and plain and sensitive about it and has an intense crush on francois blachere is a good actress and adds to the ungainliness of the character through her performancebr br the movie deals with the relationships between these three meaning intrigues deceptions hidden feelings and all the rest of what we associate with young girls who spend much time with one another this is of course a tricky topic it becomes trickier during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between pauline and adele not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie the only nudity we see is considerably less than a turn on and what little sex there is under the covers sometimes literallybr br i dont think i want to get into the plot or into its analysis too much partly because its suggestive rather than expressed through action partly because its complex and partly because im not sure i got it allbr br let me give an example okay adele is the girl the others envy shes also quite distant and self satisfied on top of that she is apparently schtupping every boy and man in sight if they can be of any use to her at all from the handsome but dumb francois to the bus driver she wants a favor from she brags unashamedly about her expertise in fellatio when pauline approaches her about joining the swim team adele uses her as a lookout during assignations with the guys a superior and selfindulgent narcissist you know but then the soidisant slut takes the skinny pauline under her wing and reveals to pauline that shes still a virgin really yes really pauline begins to draw closer to adele and adele finally confesses that shed like to rid herself of her hymen and she would like pauline to do it for her pauline now drawn sexually to adele performs the task with subdued relish now adele would really like to get it on with a man preferably older and experienced so she takes pauline to a boite where she dances seductively with some guy until she follows pauline to the powder room the two girls stand there staring at one another neither having overtly expressed a sexually tinged interest in the other but adele stands so close that pauline slowly loosens her own reins reaches up and kisses adele on the lips adele steps back smiling and says there now that wasnt so bad was it and then walks back into the clubbr br thats a pretty close description of whatever is going on between pauline and adele  but what the hell is going on initially adele treats pauline like an irrelevant child later like a close friend finally like a potential lover  and the minute pauline responds adele walks off satisfied is she using pauline the way she seems to be using men does it satisfy adele to know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude i dont knowbr br ive slighted louise blachere as the third member of the trio the plain and overripe wallflower whose expression always suggests dumbfoundedness but who at least is thoroughly heterosexual and the first of the three to rid herself of that noisome virginity but ive only skipped her for considerations of spacebr br should you see it by all means just compare it to the typical american movie about high school kids for men some of whom have never penetrated the female mystique this may give you some idea of what it looks like in medium shot
0,in the world of oldschool kung fu movies where revenge pictures came a dime a dozen it took a lot for a film to stand out  and even more to make it a fan favorite after all these years what is arguably chang chehs finest movie continues to hold influence over the hong kong movie industry from the themes of loyalty brotherhood and revenge as explored by john woo who got his start in the hk movie industry working for chang during the heyday of heroic bloodshed during the late 1980s to more modern movies like a man called hero which sports a character in a costume inspired by this film the influence has also carried into other areas as well from music such as the wutang clan tv commercials for sprite and video games such as mortal kombat so what makes this movie so special the plot  on the surface  is pretty simple it deals with members of a rogue group known as the poison clan who are searching for a treasure hidden by their sifu all of the members of the clan have extraordinary kung fu abilities denoted by their animal styles or venoms the lizard can climb walls the scorpion has a deadly strike etc the twist is that since the clan always wears masks not all of them known who the others are thus a simple plot becomes almost a suspense thriller were not talking the usual suspects here but its far above many other kung fu movies of the time supposedly golden harvest was not too happy with changs script  like most of his movies they felt it was too dark and violent  and they actually wanted him to add broad comic relief to it thankfully chang stuck to his guns and stayed with his original script which has since has become revered as one of the best for the films of its time if not ever completing an almost perfect dramatic arc and providing the perfect backbone for the extraordinary action sequencesbr br but what really solidifies the movie are the venoms themselves chang cheh hit upon a magical formula with the cast  not only did he gain talented martial artists whose moves competed without the aid of wires or other special effects put most modern martial artists to shame but great actors as well the formula proved so popular that chang usually had one or more of the venoms in his later movies getting back to matters at hand in most oldschool movies the actors seem to playing out cardboard cutouts but here the actors actually create characters it seems that everyone has a favorite venom mine is philip kwok  best known to many as mad dog from hardboiled  as lizard and it is this personal connection to the characters that the five deadly venoms generates which makes it a true classic of the genre even if youre normally not a fan of oldschool movies you need to check the five deadly venoms out if for nothing else to see where modern movies got their inspiration from
3,contrary to most other comments about syriana on the imdb website i and my family found watching this film on dvd at home a complete waste of time and spacebr br in short this was a film based on a script whose writer was being too clever by far rather than trying to tell a complex story in an intelligent and clear manner it was assumed that constantly throwing mostly vague and hard to connect with each other 30second vignettes of different storylines from a dozen or so storylines at the audience made for great and clear viewing no sir it does not what does make for great viewing is total clarity precision plots and storylines  and characterisations  which have a beginning a middle and an endbr br this kind of cinematic presentation  akin to the dim sum experience in a chinese restaurant  is pretentious and unintelligent in the extremebr br thank goodness then for the tv and dvd presentations of the hollywood and british film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s whose writers director and actors knew the value of clear story telling diction and acting that meant somethingbr br this is one dvd that this family will not be sitting through again
0,water lilies is a wellmade first film from france about young female sexuality and friendship sciamma works with specialized slightly sanitized material that is as offputting to some as it is alluring to others the film focuses exclusively on three middleclass teenage girls in a tidy new paris suburb their lives revolve around a big indoor swimming pool where two of the three are part of a synchronized water ballet teambr br such distractions as parents siblings work and school have been neatly excised from the equation the central sensibility belongs to the attractively sullen but skinny marie pauline acquart who is not on the team but thinks she would like to be marie worships floriane adle haenel an alluring blonde and team standout whom the boys are after this takes marie away from her former best friend also a member of the water ballet team the somewhat plump anne louise blachre being less special anne is more truly accessible to the boys floriane like this film promises a bit more then she truly offers marie has the more essential quality for a teenage girl she suffers inwardly flroiane doesnt so much suffer as jump into situations and then boltbr br marie is dazzled by the glamor of the water ballet as well as floriane floriane takes advantage of this to make marie first her slave and a cover for her assignations then lacking any other friends her confidante all the other girls think floriane a slut an illusion she encourages in the men and boys she teases because it leads them on she suffers the pretty girls fate of being not a person but an object and she cant resist the validation the boys give her by wanting to kiss her and bed her but she doesnt really care about any of them and knows her involvements with them are a trap enlisting marie to act as her pal so her unseen mother wont know shes going out to meet boys she also gets marie to rescue her from the boys later it looked the opposite at first but floriane needs marie as much as marie thinks she needs her anne is left with her discomfort with her body and a desire to get laid thats earthier and more real than the other girlsbr br keeping all external context at bay sciamma can highlight subtle shifts in the delicate equation of the three girls goals and interactions on the other hand the films water madness which includes lots of showering and spitting as well as underwater swimming shots makes it feel completely airless at times and some of its 95 minutes do not pass so quickly luckily the film has a sense of humor and lets the trio sometimes forget their everpresent goals and avoidances and just do silly pointless girl things its the offbeat moments that give the film life too bad in a way that there arent more of them but sciamma has the courage of her obsessions and what remains as one walks out of the theater is the personalities and their dynamics along the way of course it is pleasant to watch the swimming and to gaze at the girls who understandably love to gaze at themselves br br theres no great revelation or drama on the way but things get a bit more interesting when it emerges that marie doesnt just admire but truly desires floriane and is jealous of her boyfriendswhom floriane always stops before they go all the way in a typical irony of this kind of plot floriane actually decides she wants to have her first real sex with mariebut marie is the one who holds off because she knows it wont have the significance to floriane that it will have to her when it happens its a timid mechanical affair meanwhile anne has a huge crush on francois warren jacquin a male swimmer but of course he is after floriane boys are not an element thats been subtracted and there always seem to be several dozen ready at poolside or on the dance floor but they are just bodies and faces available studs

6,i recently watched this film at the 30th gothenburg film festival and to be honest it was on of the worst films ive ever had the misfortune to watch dont get me wrong there are the funny and entertaining bad films eg manos  hands of fate and then there are the awful bad films this one falls into the latter category the cinematography was unbelievable and not in a good way it felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot the lighting was something between one guy running around with a light bulb and non existing the actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them the only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer a classic look a la jason vorhees from friday the 13th the plot was extremely poor and the ending even worse i would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is not supposed be look like or maybe an insomniac needing sleep
3,the brain or head that wouldnt die is one of the more thoughtful low budget exploitation films of the early 1960s it is very difficult to imagine how a script this repulsively sexist could have been written without the intention of selfparody and the themes that are expressed repeatedly by the female lead ginny leith  a detached head kept alive by machines ivs and clamps  seem to confirm that the film was meant to simultaneously exploit and critique gender stereotypes shades of the underrated boxing helenabr br the genderisms are plentiful and about as irritating as an army of angry ants the dialog is hyperbolic overdramatic and unbelievable and the acting is merely ok but not consistent why have i given this film a because some thought clearly went into it i am really not sure what point the film was really trying to make but it seems clear that it strives for an unusually edgy and raw sort of horror without the blood and guts todays audiences expectbr br another unique and interesting aspect of the brain is that there really are not any heroes in this film and none of the characters are particularly likablebr br all considered this is a fairly painful and disturbing look at early 1960s american pop sexuality from the viewpoint of a woman kept alive despite her missing body after what should have been a fatal car crash her lover is threatening to sew a fresh high quality body onto her and force her to continue living with him she is understandably nonplussed by all of this and forced to befriend a creature who is almost as monstrous as her boyfriend oh there are also some vague references to the 1950s60s clich about the evils of science run amokbr br recommended for b sci fi buffs and graduate students in gender studies ow not recommended
0,i happened to watch this movie by chance some days ago while flipping channels my expectations were not very high but it was an interesting moviein a guy thing jason lee plays paul a straightlaced seattlebased fellow who is about to marry his fiance karen selma blair and settle down to an unchallenging life of middleclass domesticity we first meet paul at his bachelor party where he professes no desire to engage in any of the normal bachelor party type activities his surprisingly few buddies encourage in case hes a bit naughty and gets into hot bother with his soon to be trouble and strife of course the next thing paul knows its the morning after the night before hes in bed with a naked hula dancer and his motherinlaw phones to inform him that karen is on her way over oh and the hula dancer is karens cousin becky julia stilesbr br from this small acorn of potential trouble grows a mighty oak of frenetic misfortune as paul scrabbles from misadventure to misadventure trying to cover up what hes done whilst keeping up the appearance of being a dutiful familyoriented good guy whos superexcited about his forthcoming nuptials his efforts to ensure karen remains none the wiser about any potential wrongdoing on his part ironically forces paul closer and closer to the funloving becky forcing him to question whether he really wants the life that seems to have been mapped out for him the movie contains the right mix of comedy and romance definitely worth a watch
1,this movie only gets a second star because i work downtown and liked seeing it destroyed the effects were pretty good i hear it was the most expensive korean film ever made being the most expensive and still absolutely horrid makes it a massive waste of money i rented it so i wont complain too much about what i paid but it was a couple hours that ill never get back plot holes abound terrible acting all across the board i do not recommend giving up the time to watch this movie life is too short if your friends want to watch this run away i cant stress enough how bad this film was br br where the hell did the second dragon come from why didnt he show up sooner how did they have rocket launchers on dinosaurs just 500 years ago
7,from watching only the trailer to theodore rex you would think this is a bad buddy cop comedy with whoopi goldberg and a guy in a dinosaur costume that is true but this is mostly a futuristic story which looks a lot like batman forever with its direction style and weird character designs it was mismarketed and should have been marketed as a futuristic tale instead of just a lame cop comedy whether or not this movie is mismarketed its still a horrible moviebr br in the future dinosaurs have been brought back to life through amazing technology and they talk and walk around like humans teddy is a dinosaur detective who is never taken seriously but after a dinosaur is murdered hes given the case to work on but he has to be partners with the toughest cop of them all katie coltrane whoopi goldberg its up to this mismatched duo to solve the murder and its up to the audience to stay awake long enough to make it through this piece of crudbr br teddy starts the picture as a normal acting character but by the end he is unbearable to listen to for some reason along with being a detective hes also a bad comedian and a bad impersonator he does imitations of famous people and accents and has some truly awful lines whoopi blames him for farting and he says its not my butt trumpet wow what a puerile immature line even for a kids movie of this caliber whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone i was hoping teddy would bite her head off the entire length of the filmbr br this movie never knew what it wanted to be when the futuristic scenes and action occur there is no comedy or humor in any nonaction scenes the characters try to be as funny as they can which just results in nonstop straight faced boredome the action scenes dont work as theyre too weird and not violent enough and as stated earlier the comedy is just a bunch of massacred jokes nothing ever works herebr br having a dinosaurhuman detective duo seems like a pretty original movie if nothing else nope this movie is a huge ripoff of who framed roger rabbit just replace dinosaurs with cartoons and set it in the future and its the exact same plot a man is killed a dinosaur is killed a dinosaur and detective solve the murder a toon and detective solve the murder the bad guys in roger rabbit are christopher lloyd and weasels the bad guys here are a guy who sounds like christopher lloyd and guys who act just like the weasels the club scene in roger rabbit where jessica rabbit walks down the stage is imitated with dinosaurs this is a huge ripoff of a much better moviebr br overall this is a bad movie not even deserving of its straight to vhs staturebr br my rating 12 out of  90 mins pg for mild violence language and crude humor
5,this movie is a perfect example of an excellent book getting ruined by a movie jacob have i loved is quite possibly the worst film that i have ever seen there is no storyline plots disappear and the editing is awful to top it all off the music is straight from a synthesizer and sounds unbelievably terrible bridget fondas acting is decent but everyone elses acting is totally amateur i would suggest this movie to someone who is studying to be a producer as a study on how not to produce a movie as it is chock full of bad cutscenes bad transitions and acting that should have been reshot read the book and dont waste your time with this film
1,this film which is based on a true story comes from first time director and long time actor denzel washington denzel washington has given us some of the best performances of the last decade as a black soldier in the civil war in glory and a lawyer in the acclaimed philadelphia and of course he made special notoriety last year when he won the academy award for best actor in training day in which denzel washington became the first african american to receive the award for best actor i guess denzel wanted a change of pace so he chose to direct antwone fisher in which he also stars fisher is played by derek luke who is new to the silver screen but has made some guest appearances on such television shows as king of queens and he will be appearing in the upcoming film release of biker boyzbr br 	this is a truly well done film from denzel washington considering it was his first time directing undoubtedly denzel felt some kind of commitment and believed in the real life story of antwone fisher antwone fisher is about a young african american man in the navy who constantly gets into fights and after one particular brawl he is sent to see a navy psychiatrist named jerome davenport played by denzel washington davenport helps antwone to deal with his troubled past and learn to move on with his life by finding his birth mother who had to give him up at birth because she was in prison what makes this film good is the fact that its not overly melodramatic i was expecting something a little more like good will hunting with a lot of swearing fighting and vulgarity not that i didnt like good will hunting or the swearing fighting and vulgarity of the film were out of place quite the contrary however antwone fisher is a true story and i dont think that washington wanted to sensationalize the story for dramatic affect in the film dont get me wrong there are moments when we see antwone fighting carrying on and having moments when it seems like the world is closing in on him after all in his first session with his psychiatrist the character played by washington devenport asks fisher where he was born and fishers response is from under a rock an obvious jab at the pressures waning on antwone fishers soul but i had to appreciate the fact that this film wasnt sensationalized for dramatic affect i think it shows real character on the part of denzel washington to deliver a more realistic story and to avoid the typical clichs that are common in hollywood films even those based on true stories one other point that i would like to bring up about antwone fisher is the acting over all performances were good in the film but not great at times i think it was a bit obvious that the main characters were actors but overall to complain about performances in this film would be ludicrous one actress that i would like to point out in this film is viola davis she plays antwones mother but she says barely two sentences in the movie at all but not so much because she appears at the end of the film but more because she in shock that her long lost son antwone has found her what i would like to point out about her as an actress in the lack of use of her she in basically a character actress and i havent seen her play any really elaborate roles she made appearances in traffic out of sight kate  leopold and two recent films far from heaven and solaris in steven soderbergs remake of solaris she played a scientist on a doomed space craft orbiting a planet in that film she is confronted by george clooneys character and she drawn to tears by what clooney tells her in a particular scene when i first saw solaris i remember seeing her tear up in the scene and thinking wow this woman can act it was as if you could feel the characters grief in that brief shot of her face she gave so much expression and i honestly felt very sorry for her characters sadness and trouble in the film i think she has definite potential as an actress and should be used more often perhaps in leading roles rather than just as a character driven actress nonetheless antwone fisher is a very good movie denzel washington as always pulls off a great performance and he gives us a great directorial debut also derek luke is a very talented actor i think that antwone fisher will bring his immense critical fame for his portrayal of the troubled man but i think that his public popularity will increase with the release of biker boyz which also stars lawrence fishburn antwone fisher is based on the book finding fish a memoir by antwone quenton fisher 
7,next to star wars and the wizard of oz this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made its a true shame its not as wellknown as the former films maybe because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than contemporary or scifi settings and that its british meaning a smaller market for films but its wonderful to know that its deserved that reputationbr br like all great family films one can be a child an adult or even a teenager to enjoy this film im currently 18 but one must appreciate classic films first i absolutely adore this film it has an extraordinary music score by miklos rozsa perhaps my favorite classic film score that rivals any john williams star wars score a fast but not flashy pace beautiful sets dialog and use of color both the sets and cinematography won oscars and stateoftheart oscarwinning special effects for the time and some are still stunning and of course june duprezs sultry looks as the princess rivals that of catherine zetajones she even looks like jones in a waybr br in conclusion this is one of my alltime favorite movie next to the adventures of robin hood and it truly deserves more attention it is a true adventure of enchantment throughout and along with robin hood its my desert island film that i could watch over and over again without getting annoyedbr br stars  excellent
1,bruce almighty is the best jim carrey work since the truman show and was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent hey hollywood  look how good i can act box office disappointments its great to see jim recognizing and embracing his strengths he wont get an academy award but the film itself will last longer than many of the awarded films of the academy he is at the top of his form in this most recent film  its like the return of an old friendbr br carrey freeman and aniston all do a great job together  comfortable in their comedy roles superb comic timing and obviously having fun together but without the hey mom  look how funny i am type of comedy a real surprise was steven carrell as carreys nemesis carrell of the daily show fame who walked away with some the best and funniest scenes of the film i laughed harder at carell than anyone else in the past three yearsbr br i can foresee the religious nuts in the us will be upinarms over the treatment of god but the bottom line of the film is true to all major theological beliefs  we are masses of protoplasms trying to get through our short lives by exercising our free will without married with children t o complain about this will likely become a target of people with misplaced priorities who know the types  men adorned in gold watches on sunday morning and late nigh television selling prayers to god and again about 05 of the country will care and 80 of the media will report itbr br the bottom line this a purely entertaining film each audience member laughingly wondering what they would do and a feelgood feeling at the movie conclusion a walk down any major street in america has to confirm that god has a tremendous sense of humor what better comic genius to remind us of that than jim carrybr br thanks again jim  its great to have you back
0,first of all jenna jameson is the best actress in this movie and shes just awful this movie has every horror move clich in imagination and all badly played the oversexed teen couple the comicalnothorny jock the snotty cool chick the creepy local color guy the parentaltype couple the virginal chick who amazingly never dies in these films the dialogue is so painfully awful and delivered with the depth of a wading pool its almost like youre wishing that theyd all die sooner i saw the rough cut of this film a while ago but somehow this just got worse sure the funniest thing in here is the ghoul trying to eat jamesons implants but that hardly rates even a rental of this dog avoid at all costs
5,i remember casper comic books but dont remember any cartoons maybe they werent memorable i dont know but at my advanced age here i am watching this very early casper animated short yesterday afterward i was shocked to read the usercomments here did people miss the endingbr br i have to learn all over again that casper isnt like the other ghosts who like to go out each night and scare the cp out of everyone he sees no future in that according to the narrator here instead one night he goes out to the rural section of town inadvertently scares some animals and cant find any friends it brings him to tears until a little fox hears him bawling and befriends him the two become buddies but soon the fox is running for his life with a fox hunt in progressbr br other reviews have all mentioned what happens so ill touch on that too the fox is killed by hunting dogs not shown and casper is in tears for losing the only friend i ever had but nobody mentions the happy ending to this story ferdie the fox becomes a spiritfigure like casper jumps on his lap licks his face and the narrator comments they lived happily ever after both characters look overjoyedbr br what is so sad about that this is a nice story with a nice happy ending
3,obviously there wasnt a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production but the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot i mean brutal on the level of ju dou and other great chinese films i first saw this when i was 14 years old i ran home and begged god to forgive me for everything
7,im a nice guy and i like to think of myself as genretolerant and i guess by that i mean i try to consider a movie in the context of the genre that it resides in if nothing else that saves me from feeling like i should be saying really nasty things about people or films which i dont like doingbr br the plot in this one was patently obvious the production values very low and sets uhm simplistic the acting rose into good for a high school play territory from time to time my feeling was this was filmed in a day  please tell me it wasbr br worst of all the sex  while reasonably plentiful was fairly mundane hampered by at least in my copy a soundover that was inconsistent with the action climatic moans and shrieks while lying on a bed undoing a bra there was definitely no edge to it at allnothing distinguishing or interesting and with surprisingly quick cutsbr br my vote is a then with the following summary statement would have been better if the filler stripper material at the club was expanded and the rest of the movie condensed
6,having grown up in texas and less than 15 miles from what used to be gilleys i can tell you that this movie is nauseating the majority of texans do not live like this movie indicates the plot is weak and the fake accents are amusing and it reinforces the stereotypical image that all texans are beer drinking honkytonkin rednecks the horribly fake texas accents is what kills it for me true there is a certain texas twang to most texans accents but these people overdo it you cant get someone from new jersey and ohio to do texas accents it just doesnt work john travolta should have stuck to discodancing or the 50s debra winger was more convincing as wonder girl than she is as a texan
0,eddie murphy is one of the funniest comedians ever  probably the funniest delirious is the best standup comedy ive ever seen and it is a musthave for anyone who loves a good laugh ive watched this movie hundreds of times and every time i see it  i still have sidesplitting fun this is definitely one for your video library i guarantee that you will have to watch it several times in order to hear all the jokes because you will be laughing so much  that you will miss half of them delirious is hilariousbr br although there are a lot of funny comedians out there  after watching this standup comedy most of them will seem like secondclass citizens if you have never seen it  get it watch it  and you will love it it will make you holler 
5,first of all let me comment that the audience loved it from the first moment perhaps current events in the middleeast led people to take the attitude i came for a comedy and by george im going to enjoy it but for whatever reason everybody seemed really into the comedy of it the last few times woody has tried to do a straight comedy small time crooks curse of the jade scorpion hollywood ending ive felt like the oneliners felt strained and a bit antiquated i remember thinking at one point that would have been funny in the early sixties so going in to this movie i was afraid woody was becoming tone deaf however in this one his comic sensibilities were in perfect tune admittedly there were plenty of my fellow aarp card carrying folks in the screening but there were also plenty of 20somethings and 30somethings as well and they all seemed to get it and give up the occasional belly laugh in addition to numerous guffaws chuckles and the like in many instances the throwaways had people laughing so loud you missed the next linebr br thematically woody was traipsing familiar ground as i suspected from the trailer this film had a lot of manhattan murder mystery in it but then again there was more than a smidgen of oedipus wrecks new york stories alice and even a little tribute to broadway danny rose at the very beginningbr br even with woody in the movie scarlett as sondra was at times the woodyproxy but her character was far from the nebbish that say will ferrell gave us in melinda and melinda or kenneth branaugh attempted in celebrity instead of archetypal ticks and quirks sondras nerdishness comes directly from the family history which she shares early on on numerous occasions the family business leads her to malapropisms that we get as an audience while the characters on the screen can only perceive them as strange nonsequiturs since we are all in on the joke we cant help but laugh but the laughs dont come from recognizing the woody nebbish but truly from the character to a great extent unlike farrell branaugh cusack or even mia farrow before her scarlett is not required to use the woody voice to evoke the woody role thus we dont find ourselves ripped out of the narrative as a woodys voice suddenly emerges from someone else facebr br as my friend commented on the way out sid the character played by woody is a supporting role but more centerstage than i was hoping going in however this time woody seems to have written a character that truly fits his current persona unlike his ed dobel sage character in anything else or his blind director in hollywood ending this time the character is a comfortable fit perhaps more importantly this time the character works in the story within the elevated circles they find themselves in he is even more fishoutofwater than scarlett which is used to great comedic effect throughout sid is a declining itinerant magician playing to small audiences but the fact that he is from another era is placed front and center for our enjoymentbr br but what about jackman what about ian swearengen mcshane i liked both of them to the extent that they are used in the piece i particularly liked mcshanes short but effective turns jackman is charming with the ease of old money that was so often portrayed in films from 50 years ago class echoes from purple rose of cairobr br so what did i think short answer maybe his best straight comedy since 1994s bullets over broadway less stylized than mighty aphrodite less caustic than deconstructing harry less forced than small time crooks or hollywood ending woody has finally found a comic voice that works in the 21st century
0,im sorry to say this but the acting in this film is horrible the dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time ever perhaps i got the dress rehearsal version by mistake the director overuses slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves the story is pretty well written and the fight sequences are actually better than i have seen in many action films the fights seem pretty real but all of this happens while to two leading actors time and time again miraculously survive incredible amounts of pointblank automatic weapon fire grenades morter rounds and bazookas the enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots i have ever seen especially when they have the escaping truck in their sights from about 30 yards and every bazooka shot is wide by at least 50 feet those bazookas need serious site calibration
0,ok i know that a lot of people will probably resent this review as watership down is a classic and a standard part of most peoples childhood but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of 18 i must admit i really hated itbr br we watched this film because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it and many people who whimpered at the very words watership down their memories of seeing the film as children and having their emotions torn at the seams recommended it to be honest i wish i hadnt bothered i gave it the benefit of the doubt generally i dont like to stop watching a film half way through this was an exception it was really really excruciatingly sickeningly dull this film was possibly the slowest thing ive ever watched imagine a dopedup snail in space and really didnt do it for me the art was alright the backgrounds were nicely made if not a little bland and twee yet the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite jumpy and poorly producedbr br im not going to go into huge details about the storyline basically it is the tale of a group of rabbits who leave their warren due to the infiltration of humans in the area generally a moralistic story about the perils of human interactions on the environment it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to put the message across for me i kind of wished that they would get gassed not because im a horrible sadistic person but because the characters were uninspiring annoying dull and generally quite rude oh im so terribly english i found that i was constantly looking at the clock whilst watching the film and it took a whole 20 minutes or so before anything actually happened and even that was a terrible anticlimaxbr br if i were to praise it in any way id have to admit that the concept of showing children the perils of building on the countryside and hopefully unveiling the arrogance of humans etc etc is quite wellmeaning maybe it is all in general sanctimonious and preachy but the message its trying to put forth is good in its nature the musical score was not bad toobr br so to conclude this film is pretty poor i couldnt watch it the whole way through or id probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom granted it isnt torque bad but it still doesnt rate highly in my eyes so ive given it a 210br br hope this helps
1,when my deja vu my deja vu aired last season i was pleased scrubs i thought is doing something clever and unique in regards to the clipshow concept instead of replaying footage theyre replaying jokes in a selfaware manner and i really enjoyed itbr br i found it really unfortunate that i was wrong one season later they succumbed to that which almost all sitcoms inevitably do the clip showand it looked like it was put together by the workexperience kid dr coxs shaved head shows just how lazy the editors were in putting it together as it doesnt appear again until my long goodbye some episodes later i cant imagine that a wig is too much effort when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once a wellconstructed sitcom who knows why it was slotted there it just seemed lazy and out of place reminding me largely of episodes that have aired within the past yearbr br three second clips jammed together with background music is a dvd extra for a very rainy day not an episode of primetime television
0,ive just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions a bunch of kids 14 to 22 put on the dvd of titanic on a fantastic state of the art mega screen home entertainment type deal only two of them had actually seen it before but they all had seen the moment of kate leo and celine dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the whole movie shortly after the epic started they started to get restless some of them left asking the others  call us when the iceberg appears over an hour and a half into the movie only the two girls who had seen the movie before were still there they started shouting iceberg iceberg a stampede followed they all came back to see the sinking of the titanic they sat open mouthed emitting ohs and far outs so just like i thought when the movie first burst into the scene what is this one and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing to sink but what about the rest of the of it dr zivagho for instance had a similar running time but think how much takes place in that film within the same period of time in titanic leo teaches kate how to spit look at the faces and hands of the supposedly creme de la creme in the first class dining room of the ship look at the historical details if you can find them the storyline is so thin that they have to introduce guns and shootings in a ship that is about to sink the real sinking here is of film standards all the efforts are focus on special effects and opening week ends the film went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time so what do i know
0,mgm were unsure of how to market garbo when she first arrived in hollywood mayer had a lot of faith in her and her appearance in torrent justified that she did not speak a word of english so she must have found it difficult to work also ricardo cortez did not make it very easy for herbr br the torrent of the title is the river juscar that winds through a sleepy little village in spain leonora greta garbo hopes someday that her voice will bring great wealth and happiness to her struggling parents leonora and don rafael ricardo cortez are in love but he is under his mothers thumb and cannot get her to consent to his marriage meanwhile dona brull martha mattox has evicted leonoras parents from their home and they send leonora to paris hoping to give her a chance to further her singing career leonora sends a note to rafael urging him to remember his promise and come with her his mother is enraged and forbids him to go  so of course he caves in to her requestbr br years pass leonora has a new identity  she has become la brunna the toast of the paris opera rafael has turned out just as his mother wished  he is running for office and is courting a safe young girl remedios gertrude olmstead who is a hog heiress mack swain plays her father leonora decides to visit her old home and i agree  why hasnt she helped her mother out her mother is still living at the family home working as a skivvy and taking in washing leonora and rafael meet but leonora is full of ridicule garbo is so enchantingly beautiful it is hard to believe that he could be happy with remediosbr br the dam is bursting and the torrent is flooding the town leonoras house is in the path of the raging river but when rafael attempts to rescue her he finds she is quite safe they then rekindle their romance there is a horizontal love scene in this film very similar to the one in flesh and the devilbr br dona brull goes spreading gossip about how leonora really got her wealth and leonoras mother believes her and tells leonora to go rafael meets leonora just before she is about to tour america again he intends to go with her but again he lets her down he spends so much time listening to other people destroy her reputation  what will she do for you but drag you down the irony is she has just secured a top government job for him if he comes with her they meet again years later  she is as fresh and vibrant as ever  he looks older than his years bowed down by mediocritybr br it is certainly a good film with a positive message to follow your heartbr br lucien littlefield does a good job as cupido the barber and leonoras old and faithful friendbr br highly recommended
3,there arent many good things to say at all about underneath soderberghs untrue endeavor into neonoir soderbergh remakes robert siodmaks decent noir crisscross faithfully not altering the plot very much at all however the adaptation drains it of every ounce of its stateoftheart film noir atmosphere giving it the same story set in the very least appealing places lifestyles and anachronisms soderbergh who would later make wonderful crime films like out of sight and the oceans series with great style and atmosphere takes the dangerously obvious route to modernization by renovating the story with the ugliest dullest and flattest fashions of the early 1990s nightclubs have terrible revoltingly dressed garage bands peter gallaghers uninteresting version of burt lancasters antihero is left by his femme fatale girlfriend for compulsively buying cinematically lifeless modern appliances like stereos tvs and other up to date pieces of equipment that suck the reaction out of the filmbr br it couldve been more entertaining and less boring had it a few saving graces like a good score more flesh to its characters more than just william fichtner giving performances that arent wooden a crisper pace unfortunately underneath has none of these things soderbergh a fine director does not utilize his dry detachment to the benefit of his film this time that disposition works wonderfully when hes helming a crime movie with more tongue in its cheek like the george clooney pictures previously mentioned or a social or character drama like traffic or sex lies and videotape with a movie like underneath it intensifies the boredom experienced by the viewer
1,kubrick proved his brilliantness again now in a suspensehorror film based on stephen kings book titled the same way jack torrance is a man in his forties married with one child and with a past of trouble and alcoholism the overlook hotel in colorado suspends service during the winter because of its extreme weather and there is a wellpaid job for the person who takes care of the facilities during those five months and torrance who was looking to become a writer found it perfect but the manager advised torrance about the loneliness in this place during the winter potentially dangerous and told him that some caretaker in the past went crazy and murdered his family even before they got there his son danny who has some sort of imaginary friend who illuminates him the future shinning knew the place wasnt good and didnt want to go once they installed themselves in the hotel things started right but within a month jack began acting strange irritated and depressed at this point we know something is going to happen but dont know when and how scary things happen such as the appearance of two twin girls talking to danny and someone who attacked him violently they are not alone in this place later on jack started to see other people and immediately felt good with them like if they were his family among them the famous psychotic caretaker delbert grady grady tells torrance that he must kill his family because they are intruders in the hotel obeying this order jack went for the objective and many of the most scary things ive ever seen happen here the ending is spectacular and the viewers will stay interested and shocked until the last minute
5,i do try not to take imdb ratings to heart but i was flabbergasted when i saw the 54 rating to one of my childhood favourites it doesnt wow me as much at 17 but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie kids will definitely love it and wont mind the flaws and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film none of the film was preachy in any way in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness i will admit though that the story is on the thin side and some scenes like screweyess deathwhich still freaks me out may be a tad on the scary side but the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation the music by james horner is very beautiful and the song featured is memorable catchy and amusing i really liked the characters louie is probably the most indepth of them all but the dinosaurs were at least engaging martin shorts clown was both hilarious and emphatic the part when he tells screweyes i quit had me in stitches my favourite is screweyes though an effective villain who is crafty and i suppose intelligent if anything though i wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he couldve been more developed in terms of depth the script while not oscarworthy has its funny and heartwarming parts and should keep kids and adults entertained the voice acting for me was what made the movie john goodman martin short rhea perlman felicity kendall and yeardley smith all gave solid performances but special mention has to go to kenneth mars for he was absolutely superb as screweyes and almost unrecognisable all in all this is a good movie i dont get the rating honestly i dont sure this film isnt perfect and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as land before time but it is good fun 7510 bethany cox
7,i actually didnt start watching the show until it came on fx i was bored and had nothing to watch and saw that the shows reruns were premiering so i decided to watch it i was so upset that i had not watched the show when it first aired on tv i loved the show so muchfinally a show for everyone to enjoy i remember full house and family matters and step by step and they were okay shows but just not funny enough they would make dumb jokes and laugh over things that were just plain stupid but not that 70s show that 70s show was hilarious smart and so real i think it was the best show ever made and im very sorry that it ended although i love this show i do think it should have ended on the seventh season when eric and kelso leave the last season was just not right eric was the main character and the show should have ended when his character leaves i still love this show and i hope tv starts making more shows like this one
1,i just dont see how a concordenew horizons film directed by jim wynorski and featuring the acting talents of andrew stevens and a puppet could be bad it just boggles the mind doesnt itbr br well lets make no mistake about it munchie strikes back is indeed a bad film munchie is a puppet who has been around for many centuries for reasons not fully explained until the end of the film he is sent to earth to help a single mother and her son the moms problem her main problem at least is that she has a balloon payment due on her mortgage in two weeksto the notsotiny tune of 20000 ouch she cant come up with the money because she just got fired okjust is the key word in that sentence what the was she planning on paying it off with a single paycheck maybe it wouldve been a good idea to have spent the last several years saving up for itya thinkbr br munchie has magical powers similar to those a genie would possessbut there isnt a limit on the number of wishes you can make munchie gets the boy a bunch of fancy stuff for one night but then the kid asks for it to be sent back to the mall munchie was borrowing it from the annoying furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by means of cheating a baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the earth several times sadly those dumb parents watching the game dont think its at all strange hmmbr br anyway id like to wrap this up because this has already drained away enough of my lifeforce as it is youll be truly moved by the scene where leslieanne down playing the mother kicks a dog which is yapping at her your heart will melt at her charm when she notices dollar bills fluttering down on her front yard and she wonders how it could be snowing during the summer munchie strikes backs credits promised another film to follow entitled i believe munchie hangs ten to date the movie viewing public has been robbed of what would surely have been a cinematic tour de force heh 110
0,national lampoons class reunion was a flop when it was released it didnt stay long in theaters in my big city why because its badbr br not bad in a good way but bad in a really painfully unfunny way the entire cast of actors were mostly unknowns then and have remained unknowns after this turkeybr br the idea is actually great a parody of slasher flicks but the execution is sorely lacking in every aspect br br just avoid this comedy your time is more precious than spending a nanosecond watching this embarrassing misfire
3,i happened to catch this movie on cable one afternoon i have to admit that ive never been a big baseball fan but i can sometimes get into a good sportsrelated movie what i found more interesting was the depiction of the foster family system as a therapist who has seen both the good and the bad of the community mental health and foster system i though it was rather refreshing to see a movie that showed both the ups and downs of this system people jumping from family to family biological parents not always taking an active involvement and transitions that can be but heartwrenching and heartmelting joseph gordonlevitt and danny glover are the anchor of this film and both bring very believable performances maybe it was just my emotional state but i did find myself shedding a tear at the end of the film
5,hood of the living dead and all of the other movies these guys directed look like they got together and filmed this with their buddies who have zero talent one afternoon when they were bored lines are completely unrehearsed and unconvincing i find that 95 of amateur movies and 90 of home video footage is better than this film although the similarities between them warrant the comparison hey lets see if anyone is dumb enough to buy our movies hopefully nobody else wasnt my apologies to those involved in the flic as this review is somewhat harsh but i was the dope who read your fake reviews and purchased the movie
5,if it wasnt for the bad dialogues and script i mean the direction was really in touch with its subject the actors were doing good at bringing their characters to life but in the end the thing that was really missing was a solid script to hold all the pieces together i would highly suggest not to watch this unless youre a al pacino enthusiast like i am and will watch everything he is playing in even if the result lately are rather poor this is after s1m0ne a second very bad movie for this actor that once knew how to choose roles
6,after tracking it down for half a year i finally found a copy and it was not disappointingbr br not disappointing because im one of those die hard smap fans who need to see all their works and i finally got to see the so called hot film of goro but i couldnt believe goro was forced to make a movie as such in his respectable self now im sure he cringes that he made this movie nevertheless they found the perfect person for looking embarrassed ill at ease and half depressed most of the timebr br man i still cant believe he made this moviei had to cover my eyes at many parts not believing he really made such a moviehahahahabr br but im glad to have watched it thank goodness he has grown up
7,light spoiler alert the story sounds good and if youve read the novel then youre probably expecting a deep and intense movie that could offer some insight for some interesting and insufficiently explored human relationshipsbr br true enough the script tries to do that the director tries to do that but the main cast fails miserably marias acting is so dry that lacks any feeling whatsoever her most intense moments seem almost comical sometimes she seems to be nervous due to the camera her only really feeling scene is near the end where she gets dumped by her girlfriendbr br ioana seems even more tense than maria and even worse she doesnt seem natural at all maria had the attitude even if it was artificially pushed towards being obvious but she had it and her character received some credibility and to make matters worse we dont have an insight on her where does she come from how come she got involved in the lesbian relationship how did the relationship evolve we only get some bits from her parents and their relationship just seems to be there it has a content and and end but no beginning just like her partner maria she has only once scene that is truly touching the scene where she dumps marias character kikibr br tudor is the only person in this movie aside from the landlady great acting there who manages to prove some acting talent he has his characters attitude and it fits him only once or twice he seems to falter the scene at his parents meal he tries to be obvious when it wasnt necessary at allbr br i love the story tudor chirila is ok there the landlady actually acts and puya delivers his couple of lines with style but this doesnt save the movie too bad the entire setting had huge potential and the romanian cinematography couldve used a movie on this themebr br oddly enough the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the nobackground nofeeling well marias spoken interludes are a nice try in this direction lesbian relationship of maria and ioana im quite sorry for spending money on a ticket id rather had watched it from the comfort of my room
0,this movie has been poorly received and badly reviewed the book by rebecca west was written in 1918 soon after wwi when shell shock and traumainduced amnesia were not clichs as the reviewers call it many books and movies later it is difficult to go back in time and live as the characters lived the realities of the time the war and the horror of the experience of the first war to use lethal gas the british class system the wife thought allimportant the hopeless spinster and the lover from the past still seen with the eyes of love being as young and as beautiful as she was 20 years agobr br alan bates as the amnesiac soldier who will die if he isnt allowed to see margaret the girl of his youthful dreams builds on the devotion his character showed in far from the madding crowd having seen that performance it is possible to sense his strong romantic attachment to the girl who didnt live up to the familys and societys expectations margaret says we quarreled and as you rowed away you turned your face away from me so we know that the breakup was something that he instigated that it brought him shame but that he forgot the shame in his memory of his time with margaret i havent seen all his films but in the ones ive seen he imparts a strong masculinity which shines through even in this role as the disabled soldierbr br i didnt even recognize annmargaret at first and feel that her performance has been underrated not having read the book i wondered whether the child who died was the result of acting on a borderline incestuous feeling between jenny and chris though jenny does state that she is a cousin the way kitty keeps jenny in the nursery in the hairdrying scene the fact that kitty says she always dries her hair in that room seems more a way for kitty to keep the coals of anger hot than the orientation of the room to the sun or sentiment about a lost child and the statement she made that she wished chris hadnt felt it necessary to preserve the room exactly as it was when the child was alive made her seem uncaring toward the memory of the child also jenny is shown as living in the house in a subservient role as high society would have done to a fallen member at the timebr br having recently been the recipient of the intense fantasy of a lover nonsexualin keeping with the mores of the time from 50 years ago i couldrelate to margarets and her husbands dilemma i too was cast aside because i wasnt good enough for his family and upon his rediscovery of me via the internet i was burdened with helping him deal with his still very horrifying vietnam experiences and a marriage to a woman above his class whom he didnt believe he loved my husband like margarets was very understanding but the strain was very real the lover was finally able to reconcile his reallife situation with his fantasy of loving only mebr br i thought that it was a good decision to show very little of the reliving of the war experience that was happening in chriss mind i thought of mrs dalloway with the wwi soldier who acts out very violent memories and commits suicide versus chriss joy in his fantasy of margaret in contrast the actiona of the soldier in mrs dalloway seems overwroughtbr br showing that the psychiatrist understood very little of what was happening to chris underlines what a major problem the whole group faced everyone seems to get their life back but was it the right choice
3,i saw this film a couple of weeks ago and its been stuck in my head ever since it stars two spellbinding characters in what is unfortunately a mediocre documentary to get the true story of the beales i had to wade through all of the dvds bonus material and commentaries and search the webbr br although the maysles and their fans not to mention edith and edie themselves bristle at the suggestion that this film is exploitative this is exploitation in the truest sense of the word very little effort is every made to explain the beales or how they came to the condition they were in  the maysles approach seems to be to just turn the camera on and wait for edith and edie to say something outrageous the sound even on the criterion rerelease is poor and difficult to follow although i appreciate this film was made somewhat early in the history of documentary film its ironic to compare it to geraldo riveras  far superior series on the sexual abuse of mentally retarded patients at willowbrook state school in staten island from 1972 four years before grey gardens was shotbr br to paraphrase a review in the new yorker there were many things edith and edie needed in their lives and a documentary wasnt one of thembr br as for edith and edie the thing i kept thinking while watching the film was where the hell is their family they were living in dangerous unhealthy unsafe conditions how is it that jackie o married to one of the richest men on earth or the wealthy bouvier family themselves couldnt afford to get edith and edie a decent home or at the very least hire a parttime housekeeper or caregiver to come in and keep an eye on them both its shameful and a lasting disgrace to the entire bouvier familybr br although this review may sound negative i would strongly recommend grey gardens to anyone who enjoys documentaries perhaps someday someone will come along and do a documentary about this documentary  bringing in the rich backstory and afterstory of the beales and the whole subsection of hamptons society in the 1970s
7,directed by brian de palma and written by oliver stone scarface is a movie that will not be forgotten a cuban refugee named tony montana pacino comes to america for the american dream montana then becomes the king in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his empire of crime in miami florida this gangster movie is very violent and some scenes are unpleasant to watch this movie has around 180 fwords and is almost three hours long this movie is entertaining and you will never get bored you cheer for the druglord and in some scenes you find out that montana isnt as evil as some other crime lords this is a masterpiece and i recommend that you see this you will not be disappointed 910
7,i work in a library and expected to like this movie when it came out years ago well i liked parker posey a lot shes a wonderful actress and omar townsend was really cute as her boyfriend he couldnt act but when you look like him who cares but the movie was bad it wasnt funny or cute or much of anything posey kept the movie afloat with her energy but she learned the dewey decimal system overnight and then shelves tons of books to the beat of music come on also i did have a problem with the way she looked when she became a fullfledged librarian at the endhair in a bun glasses no sense of humorcan we let that stereotype go please worth seeing for posey and townsend but thats about it the tv series was much better
7,how can barry levinson possibly assemble whitehot comedy talents ben stiller and jack black the gorgeous rachel weisz old pro christopher walken and still deliver such a humourless stinkerbr br stiller and black are friends until the latter invents a spray to make dog mess vanish and becomes a conspicuous consuming multimillionairebr br the premises is thin but sound enough in the right hands to have been a springboard for some great bitching between the two stars but all concerned overplay every hand every chance they canbr br stiller and black are simply not funny for way too much of the time weisz looks sensational as always but is criminally underused and with the exception of walken as a batty barfly who urges stillers character to take revenge its a turgid trudge to the end of this strained farce
2,where to start     i feel  violated thats right violated i just spent 15hrs of my life 15hrs that i could have spent doing something more useful like watching paint dry on this so called horror flickbr br its not scary its not funny its not dramatic its no action its nothingbr br its predictable its boring its tragicbr br i might come of a bit harsh here but watch this movie and you will feel the same way  or  no dont watch itunless you want to feel violated also
0,i rented i am curiousyellow from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967 i also heard that at first it was seized by us customs if it ever tried to enter this country therefore being a fan of films considered controversial i really had to see this for myselfbr br the plot is centered around a young swedish drama student named lena who wants to learn everything she can about life in particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average swede thought about certain political issues such as the vietnam war and race issues in the united states in between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of stockholm about their opinions on politics she has sex with her drama teacher classmates and married menbr br what kills me about i am curiousyellow is that 40 years ago this was considered pornographic really the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between even then its not shot like some cheaply made porno while my countrymen mind find it shocking in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in swedish cinema even ingmar bergman arguably their answer to good old boy john ford had sex scenes in his filmsbr br i do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in america i am curiousyellow is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes no pun intended of swedish cinema but really this film doesnt have much of a plot
2,problem with these type of movies is that literally dozens of them are being made each year luckily for use only a handful are given a theatrical release while the others are being pushed straight to video or tv such as this moviebr br the foremost problem of this movie is really its originality its one of those movies which uses the die hard formula of a tough but troubled guy being at the wrong place at the wrong time in this case its a character played by casper van dien who works for a security agency that thoroughly test safety procedures for companies and individuals in this case hes being send to a cruise ship which of course gets hijacked you can see this movie as a sort of mix of die hard and air force one and the movie doesnt even try to conceal that those two movies were probably its biggest source of inspiration so really you cant regard this movie as an original one at all it uses all of the clichs out of the book and this movie really doesnt offer any surprises or anything that remotely resembles anything originalbr br like you can expect from a movie such as this it has a very weak script or rather said it features some very lazy writing like i said before the movie features nothing original but also the actual story itself features some elements which are far from likely and are just plain ridicules truthfully i mean hijacking an huge cruise ship with only about guys of which halve only carry some small guns and then ask for a ransom of only 10 million dollars for a ship that is about worth 10 times that amount is itself already quite ridicules how do they even intend to split that money afterward every person gets just over a million or something thats hardly profitable for such a big and risky undertaking and then there is the case of taking the passengers hostage somehow they manage to take all passengers on the huge ship hostage and they manage to put them inside one room with only one guy with his pistol which he cant even seem to be able to hold right watching them you never see more than like 30 hostages however as if they were all the people who were aboard at the time also when the van dien character goes looking for his son and vice versa no matter which room they walk in through on the huge cruise ship they always bump into each other instantly just some examples of the lazy writing within the moviebr br but it of course is an action flick so the story of course becomes secondary but then again its not as if this movie features any good action at all halve of the actors look as if they had never hold a weapon before and the movie is filled with some ridicules slowmotion it really becomes laughable at pointsbr br of course the movie also doesnt feature the best actors though i must say that casper van dien really isnt a bad action hero and actor as far as the genre and bmovie circuit is concerned he just however also suffers from the same problem as tom cruise no matter how old he is he just never looks convincing enough to play the father of a teenager van dien once started out as a promising new young actor but starring in movies like this really doesnt help his career much hes probably capable of something better though he is never really given the right opportunity to show it all of the other actors also do a fair enough job but their characters are just so formulaic that they never truly become interestingbr br oh well its not the worst genre movie i have ever seen but it also aint exactly the most original or memorable one eitherbr br 410
2,william wyler was to have directed this adaptation of moss harts hit broadway play with music recruiting postervivant but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman george cukor the womens director has a sure touch on the many documentarylike sequences of air corps training and he invests it with more unhackneyed humanity than the genre generally allowed particularly in wartime sure the geewhiz and entirely white save for one unbilled chineseamerican recruit bunch of newbies are nicer and more wholesome than in real life and the speechifying about home and mom and the wife and kid gets pretty thick but its efficient propaganda and undeniably stirring notable too for the allmilitary male cast several of whom didnt reemerge for years lon mcallister edmond obrien martin ritt red buttons in drag as an andrews sister peter lind hayes karl malden kevin mccarthy gary merrill lee j cobb and don taylor also for a very early glimpse of judy holliday who doesnt show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some good little sequences as obriens worriedsick brooklyn spouse too bad its rights are in a tangle and the only print anyone knows of is 16mm evidently after twentieth century fox released it to considerable success the rights reverted to the army and if theres a good 35mm print out there it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the pentagon its disingenuous and corny in spots but it also captures the rigors of military training and the terrors of war vividly and it deserves to be more widely seen
5,i enjoyed watching this well acted movie very muchit was well actedparticularly by actress helen hunt and actors steven weber and jeff faheyit was a very interesting moviefilled with drama and suspensefrom the beginning to the very endi reccomend that everyone take the time to watch this made for television movieit is excellent and has great acting
7,something about the 40 year old virgin and the other comedy hit of the summer wedding crashers is similar but they are two different films in some respects both are romantic comedies that have that kind of overthetop crazy sensibility that keeps the teens and guys in their 20s along with the usual dating crowd to go see the films both have some sort of formula to the stories as well but by the end of the 40 year old virgin i think i found overall it was more satisfying than crashers although one can guess where the relationship story with steve carrells character andy and catherine keeners character trish will go to it isnt too basic for one to figure out like with crashers and the characters both leading and supporting are realistic more rounded than most of the onedimensional or unexplained people in the other and perhaps it may also depend on how much you identify or just find the lunacy in bothbr br the thing is some people may go into the 40 year old virgin not knowing steve carrell as well as owen wilson or vince vaughn as carrell has built up his cult status on the daily show one of my favorite shows on now and in small but unforgettably riotous roles in anchorman and bruce almighty this is his first starring role but its not treated like some third rate vehicle he and cowriterdirector judd apatow treat the character of andy with a certain level of sincerity that keeps the audience on his side all the way even early on as he talks to his action figures while repainting them its also a tricky line to walk on in lessor hands this could be no more or less entertaining than the lackluster 40 days and 40 nights with josh hartnett also about sexual dysfunction as the title suggests andy is the 40 year old who is like the nice guy friend with still a little peewee herman in him the opening over the credits of his his apartment is hilarious a good signbr br so his friends among them paul rudd romany mancoy seth rogen all very good comic foils try and devise different strategies and tips to finally break the sort of curse over andys head to pop his cherry so to speak he almost gets with a overly drunk woman he almost gets with a freaky kind of girl and almost with his own boss jane lynch also very funny in the mockumentaries as a explitive buddy but this soon all starts to fade as he gets into a meaningful relationship with trish who works across the street from him as they build on a relationship not based at all on sex one might worry that the plot gear of how is he going to tell her such and such might get in the way of the comedy it doesnt in fact if anything carrell and the cast build on it to a very high degree for practically an hour and a half of the films two hour length there was barely a moment i wasnt laughing whether big or smallbr br the big laughs though make up for not just any kind of formalities with the plot or one or two little stray stories the fellow coworkers have their own relationship problems as well rudds being the funniest the big laughs come through because of carrells reactions and that the people around him can either back up with their own sort of humorcharm or that its with some truth keener gives a very good performance and makes it so that there is a genuine spirit to their relationship and unlike crashers there isnt as much that doesnt make sense character wise for someone like me who loves it when a comedian can get laughs just from the way he looks on his face carrell gets very high points here and like with a farrelly brothers movie the more raunchy or outrageous scenes are done with total absurdity the waxing scene which was done for real by the way and the sort of aquarius musical number towards the very end of the film the way it comes out at first is a total uproarious surprise but if youre willing not to get offended by it theres more where that came from this is one of the funniest films of the year

5,illudere to delude comes from latin verb ludere to play so youre warned about the spy game as a cruel and yet elaborate and intelligent  activity stemmin from a complex and as it may appear absurd and vain personal history whatever it may be and yet i feel fascinated by the mechanism of treason and loyalty the raw material of any relationship from the personal to the social after many years ago i was able to finish the book it was a revelation at the beginning i was so bored if not for the surprising style of the writing i really started to love le carre after that novel the main character is not wavering at all he has made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love or is he not after this novel you can clearly understand the darker version of greens our man in havana wrote by lecarre with the tailor of panama there is no game left there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical way or both there is no smiley here to upheld decent human qualities in the service or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case the bbc has done a superb work with these series from lecarres novels the actors are excellent as are the locations and sets of course the script here is brilliantly adapted be warned though even if someone may find it laughable the after taste is bitter
1,elvira mistress of the dark is a fun camp horror comedy in which the fourth wall is broken a couple of times and the jokes often stay below the navel and the breasts of cassandra peterson become a character of their ownbr br elvira cassandra peterson is stacked horror show hostess who learns that she has inherited her aunt morgana so she goes to a little town of fallwell which is ruled by the most horrendous monster ever to embrace the earth morality comity elviras boobacious appearance is of course too much for the prunes but the kids of the town get a kick out of her different kind of approach on life and of course there is even more sinister evil her uncle vincent william morgan sheppard who is after elviras mothers book of spells see elvira actually is a real witch she just doesnt know it yetbr br for what it is elvira is quite funny film even though the script does leave a lot of room for improvement most laughs come from the difference between elvira and the people of good morals but there are a couple of good visual gags as well over all direction is okay but it never rises to be anything more than that in all a good intentionally campy comedy if you like this kind of thing that is

6,by the end of the first hour my jaw was nestled comfortably between my feet the movie never and i do mean never lets up in action it may be mild action but its action once again every member of the cast fits perfectly the explosions were realistic the chase scenes were feasible and the fighting was incredible matt damon will forever be jason bournebr br all i really have to say is that every bourne movie gets better and this is no exception the action the stakes the plot how they do it i will never know i applaud the man who wrote the screen plays to every one of these movies because if he hadnt done such a great job with the first movie we wouldnt have this one to talk aboutbr br so dont go see it in theaters go experience it in theaters if its still out where you live but if not december 11th bourne comes home to you
2,where to start the film started out pretty well but after the 30 min mark i caught myself watching the clock the horror at the start of the film was good but then the story kicked in it just got stupider and stupider as time ticked bybr br the actors gave an average performance in this movie however i got a bit bored of vinny jones constant scowling in the filmbr br as the film dragged on and take my word for it it dragged on it just got more and more far fetchedbr br  spoiler alert  spoiler alert  spoiler alert  just when i thought the film could not get any worse towards the end loads if skeleton looking monsters turned up just to eat the dead people which made no sense at all it turned out to be some sort of flesh eating cult and the good guys die at the end the ending in fact just made me laugh at how bad it was once the lead role disposes of vinny jones he becomes the new killerbr br in closing this film made creep look like the best horror film ever made i gave it star because the female lead did a pretty good job but even she could not save this train wreck of a movie
6,new york i love you is a collective work of eleven short films with each segment running around 10 minutes long the shorts dont exactly relate but they all have something in common love every short is about finding love either if its about a couple or just two strangers chitchattingthe film stars an ensemble cast among them shia labeouf natalie portman hayden christensen orlando bloom chris cooper andy garcia christina ricci irrfan khan robin wright penn julie christie ethan hawke bradley cooper rachel bilson and anton yelchin with such a stellar cast and such an interesting premise i was expecting a tremendous film the problem is new york i love you doesnt add up it remains the sum of its parts some of the segments are funny original and interesting but others are so meaningless orlando bloomchristina ricci and ethan hawkemaggie q segments that its appalling the film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone storywise it seems like something a few film students could put together having said that the film has some great moments as well one of the best being the segment about an old couple played by eli wallach and cloris leachman walking along in brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary and its moments like this that made me as a viewer wish the film was more consistent because theres a lot of potential here but as unsatisfying as the overall story ends up being for me the cinematography and soundtrack saved the all thing the editing was perfect the way the film was shot was very impressive and the ethereal soundtrack couldnt be more fitting in the end new york i love you feels like an experimental film and as in most experiences theres highs and lows its how one looks at the film as a whole that will determine if he enjoys it or not it might be worthwhile for some and a waste of time for othersbr br 710
5,ill dispense with the usual comparisons to a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic new yorker persona because quite frankly to draw comparisons with bumbling loser josh kornbluth is just an insult to any such director i will also avoid mentioning the spoton satire office space in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe i can however compare it to waking up during your own surgery  its painful to watch and you wonder whether the surgeons really know what theyre doing haiku tunnel is the kind of film you wish theyd pulled the plug on in its early stages of production it was cruel to let it live and as a result audiences around the world are being made to sufferbr br the films premise  if indeed it has one  is not even worth discussing but for the sake of caution i will josh kornbluth a temp worker with severe commitmentphobia is offered a permanent job his main duty is to mail out 17 high priority letters for his boss but ludicrously he is unable to perform this simple task my reaction big deal thats not a story its a passing thought at best  one that shouldve passed any selfrespecting filmmaker by br br the leading actor  if you can call him that  is a clumsy buffoon of a man with chubby features a receding untamed hairline and a series of facial expressions that range from cringemaking to plain disturbing where o where did the director find this schmuck whats that you say he is the director oh my mistake playing yourself in your own embarrassment of a screenplay is one thing but i suspect that mr kornbluth isnt that convincing as a human being let alone an actor rest assured this is by no means an aimless character assassination but never before have i been so riled up by an actors onscreen presence my frustration was further confounded by his incessant tocamera monologues in between scenes i mean as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to comprehend this drivel kornbluth insults us further by explaining the action first rule of filmmaking dramatize exposition show dont tell who does this guy think he is he has no charisma no charm and judging by his hawaiian shirts no sense of style his casting agent should be shot point blankbr br the supporting actors do nothing to relieve the intense boredom i felt with but one exception patricia scanlon puts in a very funny appearance as helen the exsecretary who has been driven insane by her old boss and makes harassing phone calls from her basement while holding a flashlight under her face this did make me chuckle to myself but the moment soon passed and i was back to checking my watch for the remainder of the filmbr br the films title is also a misnomer haiku tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of japanese poetry dont be fooled into thinking this is an art house film because of its pretentioussounding title or the fact that it only played in a handful of cinemas and made no money at the box office theres a very good reason for thatbr br 
7,featuring a few of hammers allstars this highly effective slice of british horror revolves around a house and the fates of its previous tenants whose stories are all told to a scotland yard detective in search of a missing actorbr br story number one which is probably the least impressive of the four deals with a writer and his wife whove just moved in the house and plan to stay just for a short time so that he may write one of his horror novels he creates a demented character named dominic whos a very creepy looking strangler and soon finds himself going mad as he starts to seeing this beastly looking man everywhere he goes after his wife convinces him to seek psychiatric help a subplot is introduced which frankly didnt really work for me i wont spoil it for youbr br the next story the best in my opinion stars the wonderful peter cushing as philip grayson a man whos moved into the home for his retirement years and soon makes his way to a nearby wax museumthat deals in the macabre where hes very startled to find a wax figure that looks exactly like a woman from his past soon thereafter an old friendwho also has a history with this woman is in town for business and drops by to see him the two men are in for a rude awakening as they soon discover that there was more to this woman than meets the eyebr br story three stars one of my very favoriteschristopher lee who plays john reid after moving into the home with his peculiar daughter jane the nanny that he hires becomes awfully suspicious as to the way reid suppresses his daughter well come to find outif she knew what lee did she would have certainly understoodbr br the final story is a rather lighthearted vampire tale that stars john pertwee and ingrid pitt after buying a cloak from a mysterious merchant actor paul henderson finds himself turning into the very creature that hes portrayed several times in his careerbr br overall the pacing and direction were very good as was the most of the performances there were nice gothic touches here and there and an effective score to complement the ambiance this ones a keeper and comes highly recommended
1,this is the fifth von trier film i have seen i believe that he is the only director to whom i have given such a high score on all his movies four of them the element of crime europa breaking the waves and dancer in the dark i have given a 10 and one the idiots i have given a and i have been reconsidering whether to give it a 10 since i first saw it although id like to see it once more before i do he has been chided for calling himself one of the best working directors i tend to agree with him i cannot blame him for being arrogant when he has made such great films in 50 years when von trier retires he will be looked upon as the preeminent film artist from europe perhaps from the planet and there will be classes taught in his name he simply is the bergman or fellini of our time it is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice thisbr br about europa itself ill admit that it was confusing and that its narrative did not seem strong i think thats the point this film was obviously meant to represent a nightmare or the subconscious at some level this is absolutely clear from the framing of the film max von sydows narration we are hypnotized or von trier is hypnotized and this is ourhis subconscious mind im inclined to lean more towards his mind since the degradation of europe concerns me an american very little this framing is also clear if you have seen the element of crime an even more brilliant film than this although i am disputing that in my mind what europa needs more than anything is a proper release on dvd hopefully criterion again with theatrical aspect ratio and remastered sound and picture then i am fairly sure this film would seem as great as any of von triers other films in the element of crime the film begins with a hypnotist whom we actually see on screen this time is hypnotizing fisher a european detective who wants to get to the root of his mental anguish the first words of that film are fantasy is okay but my job is to keep you on track and whenever fisher the narrator gets off track the hypnotist does chastize him and tells him to get back on with the story he even laughs when a character is given a really silly and trite line something along the lines of do you understand the difference between good and evil the hypnotist laughs and says now fisher she didnt really say that did shebr br so the key to interpreting europa almost a sequel of sorts to the element of crime is that we are deep in ourvon triers subconscious and the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone what does the train itself symbolize consider it internally and only then discuss it externally europa is a great film a masterpiece i was never bored by it even though i watched it at am the perfect time to watch actually since it works in dream logic
5,i caught this film at the edinburgh film festival i hadnt heard much about it only that it was a tightlypaced thriller shot digitally on a very low budget i was hoping to catch the next big britflick but i have to say i was severely disappointed this is not a love song follows two criminals who after accidentally shooting and killing a farmers young daughter become embroiled in a deadly game of cat and mouse when the locals decide to take matters into their own hands and hunt them downbr br the real problem is that this is yet another example of style over substance in a british film the camera angles and editing are completely at odds with the story as are the over the top performances and the appalling use of slow motion which only serves to make the whole thing look like an expensive home video there are repeated attempts to make the film look edgy and gritty which instead come over as hilarious and over the topcue a pathetic obligatory drug scene and countless pointless camera zooms no amount of cliches such as this can disguise the fact that this is a pretty bad storybr br weve seen this kind of thing many times before and made a hundred times better particularly in john boormans masterful deliverance but while in the latter film we actually cared about the characters in this film i found myself just wanting them to be hunted down and killed as quickly as possible even this wouldnt have been so bad if their adversaries had been frightening or worthwhile but instead are merely a collection of stereotypical inbredlooking countryfolk again another offensive overused cliche coming to the fore surely there are some nice people in the country filmmakersbr br in its defense this is not a love song does contain a couple of good suspenseful moments but its hard to see this film doing anything other than going straight to video or at a push getting a very limited cinema release its not a patch on last years lowbudget hunted in the hills movie dog soldiers maybe british cinema could actually get kickstarted again if the right money stopped going to the wrong people
2,i have been a fan of pushing daisies since the very beginning it is wonderfully thought up and bryan fuller has the most remarkable ideas for this showbr br it is unbelievable on how much tv has been needing a creative original show like pushing daisies it is a huge relief to see a show that is unlike the rest where as if you compared it to some of the newer shows such as scrubs and house you would see the similarities and it does get tedious at moments to see shows so close in identitybr br with a magnificent cast wonderful script and hilarity in every episode pushing daisies is byfar one of the most remarkable shows on your television

4,stranger than fiction angered me so much i signed up on imdb just to write this review stranger than fiction is a surprisingly complex touching and thoughtprovoking movie until the very end once you suspend multiple lapses of logic why didnt will ferrell hear emma thompsons voice 10 years ago when she fist started writing her book the phone rang the phone rang again how could she not know its him calling etc the movie challenges ones thoughts about mortality fate and sacrificebr br the brief history of literary themes provided by dustin hoffman should especially entertain former english majors and maggie gyllenhaal is always a pleasure even though will ferrell might just as easily be an ax murderer as a bumbling soul her quick trust of him is a mighty big leap of faithbr br ah but the ending until the very end i would have given out of 10 stars to this movie the movie as a metaphor for lifes journey as a tribute to the notion of writing true as a reminder that great literature is either comedy or tragedy but not both is outstanding the entire movie leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of will ferrells fate and no matter how endearing a character he may have become we know full well why we will accept the ending the last act occurs the screen goes white the credits roll a profound and powerful end to an almost perfect film an end that would have been debated for weeksbr br no no credits rolled say it isnt so say hollywood didnt tack on another 10 minutes of crap that completely undermined the integrity and heart of the movie dustin hoffman got it right when he said its no longer a masterpiece its ok an apt review of the movie except to me it wasnt even ok i was so offended about the betrayal of writing true about the decision to pander the film that i actually burst into angry tears explaining this on the ride home from the movie i dont often cry i could care less about most movies but i am still angry about this onebr br my questions for zack helm the writer are this did the original movie end when the screen went white and were you forced by the vapid movie powersthatbe to tack on an ending unfaithful to the core of the movie or did you tack that maudlin ending on yourself ive read youre brilliant i hope your original script ended the movie the first timebr br i know zack helm will never see this review and ive been unable to find a contact for him to ask myself but please moviegoers am i the only one who feels this way about stranger than fiction one good thing came from me seeing this movie i doubly admire lost in translation now
4,youve gotta hand it to steven seagal whatever his other faults may be he does have good taste in women if you pick a seagal movie chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it and usually they do not function as mere eye candy they get involved in the action and fight shoot guns kill with knives etc flight of fury offers the duo of ciera payton who has a very sexy face with luscious lips to match angelina jolies and katie jones and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight and a little lesbian fondling and if it seems like im spending a little too much time talking about them its because the rest of the movie although passable is so unexciting that its hard to find much else to talk about ironically the weakest aspect is probably seagal himself who looks as if he cant even be bothered to try to pretend to care this being a militarytype actioner there is very little fighting in it and he doesnt fit into his role a stealth fighter pilot the best in the world of course very well which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking 12
6,universal soldier the return is not the worst movie ever made no that honor would have to go to a film that attempted to make some sort of statement or accomplish some artistic feat but failed in a pathetic or offensive manner however perhaps no movie i have ever seen has tried for so little and succeeded so completely as did universal soldier the return br br this film is a scifiaction travesty that has virtually nothing to recommend it the acting is as bad as any movie ive ever seen the plot is terrible and predictable the special effects are pathetic in short anyone even remotely connected to this film should be ashamed of themselves us the return makes previous van damme fare seem like groundbreaking cinematic masterpieces some movies are so bad theyre good believe me when i tell you that this is not one of them im really not sure what else to say here i doubt many people were considering seeing this movie if they hadnt already but just in case dont
0,this film is a very funny film the violence is bad the acting iswell dani stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do the random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexuallyfrustrated goth lads in personally i think this movie really does suck the story and characters could be very good if say the directing the actors and other little nibby things were made better but the film is just bad the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has danni in it this film is possibly the worst brate film ever and believe me thats hard to achieve especially when youre competing with def by temptation and over crappy excuses for serious horror movies im not a cof fan and so i just see this as another rubbish moviea really bad one if dani made this as a comedy then good going him very well done over than that though i rate it low for its crappiness watch it when youre in a happy happy joy joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if youre high on multiple different types of drugs

1,what happens to washed up rocknroll stars in the late 1990s they launch a comeback  reunion tour at least thats what the members of strange fruit a fictional 70s stadium rock group dobr br tony stephen rea has the concession on condom vending machines when he runs into the son of the promoter of a famous music festival it was at that festival in the 70s that strange fruit broke up the 70s are retro and the time is right to wide that wave he sets off in search of the other members of the bandbr br part of what broke up the band was the death and replacement of keith the lead singer and brilliant song writer the band was known for its excessive lifestyle and now they are all back amongst the working class from which they came beano the drummer played by timothy spall who was brilliant in secrets and lies is a layabout the bass player is a roofer and their lead singer is still a rocker while he owns a huge mansion he has been forced to sell it as his fortune has not lasted brian the lead guitarist is dead so a young guitarist is hired to replace himbr br somewhat reluctantly the band agree to give the reunion a try abandoning their day jobs they begin to rehearse and their manager approaches their label about reissuing their albums but he wants them to start touring again first and so they hit the club circuit around europe the club scene is not kind to these overweight dated old rockersbr br it is on tour that the film really starts to develop all of the old conflicts rearise with the figures of keith and brian hovering throughout they all hang together because they are all in search of a second chance for the greatness that eluded them earlier and they rediscover some of the interpersonal chemistry that made playing together so enjoyablebr br still crazy starts as spinal tap ii but gradually becomes a more dramatically focused film following the relationships of the band members while it is still a very funny movie it is the evolving characters struggling to deal with the deaths of brian and keith and with their own personal demons that make the film work

0,please dont rent or even think about buying this moviethey dont even have it available at the red box to rent which would cost a  i think its worth less than thatthe main reason why i rented this d movie was because jenna jameson is in the movie lol between 25 mini will give credit that the movie had hot chicks and quite a bit of nudity but other than that you might as well buy another d horror movie that has the same thing with nobody you knowginger lynn has more acting time in this movie than jenna  shes not even on the front cover of the movie nor her namei recommend people to watch zombie strippers because you see jenna almost throughout the whole movie  nude most of the timethis movie is a big disappointment  such a huge waste of time
7,quite frankly it seemed like seven hours of boredom as well what is it what is it about will smith that i just cant stand any longer i guess he just seems too hellbent on being taken seriously and obtaining an oscar i understand how bias this is but unless he undergoes some new acting lessons i cant ever see him winning one hes a huge name and is therefore generally confused with being a talented and diverse actor hes just not i give him credit for trying so hard and being able to cry at the drop of a hat thats about itbr br seven pounds was kind of an eyeroller for me right from the start the suicide 911 call didnt intrigue me in any way i wasnt curious to know why he was calling in his own suicide there were absolutely no surprises the best i can say is that will smith and rosario dawson had some decent on screen chemistry also i dont know her name but the hispanic woman did an excellent job with her role as a scared and beaten wife woody harrelson had very limited screen time but id say he stole the show whenever he was onbr br all in all just an extremely run of the mill unoriginal plot i couldnt help asking myself the whole way through why i cared about any of these people never once felt sorry for timben he killed himself with a jellyfish was the only survivor in an person accident geewizdidnt see any of that comingbr br 510 is pretty generous
6,now i wont deny that when i purchased this off ebay i had high expectations this was an incredible outofprint work from the master of comedy that i so enjoy however i was soon to be disappointed apologies to those who enjoyed it but i just found the compleat al to be very difficult to watch i got a few smiles sure but the majority of the funny came from the music videos which ive got on dvd and the rest was basically filler you could tell that this was not als greatest video achievement that honor goes to uhf honestly i doubt if this will ever make the jump to dvd so if youre an ultrahardcore al fan and just have to own everything buy the tape off ebay just dont pay too much for it
0,watching this film for the action is rather a waste of time because the figureheads on the ships act better than the humans its a mercy that anthony quinn couldnt persuade anyone else to let him direct any other films after this turkeybr br but it is filled with amusement value since yul brynner has hair lorne greene displays an unconvincing french accent and the rest of the big names strut about in comicbook fashion
6,despite having known people who are either great fans of noam chomsky or think hes a tired relic from the 1960s i really had no opinion of the man save that i knew he gained fame as a linguist although i could not elucidate any of his theories and that he was a liberal socialist with marxist leanings so stumbling across the dvd of the 2003 documentary noam chomsky rebel without a pause in a used video store a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 911 i decided to get it just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person pro or con spoke of him while glad i got the film my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was so whats all the fuss aboutbr br for a man with so many degrees lauded as the most important intellectual alive by the new york times according to the dvds case there sure was not a lot there intellectually speaking i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate and i wouldnt even want to watch what a william f buckley could do to him granted the whole film was seemingly about chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things hed say rather than being on linguistics so maybe thats the reason he came off so badly but again if he is a linguist and tops in his field why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise even worse are his acolytes who seem to further insulate the man from reality by fostering delusions that chomsky is a target for zionist assassins what little i knew of chomsky before watching this film this much i knew he was generally considered a has been and pretty much irrelevant intellectually since the fall of the soviet empire the film is so poorly structured and without a narrative thread that its difficult to separate all of the jumble his wife carol as example apparently gave one interview which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film she seems a nice enough woman but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life the lone interesting thing she says is that 911 was a great thing for the chomskys for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since thenbr br not surprisingly this sort of film gives almost no biographical background its assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this great man bears chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one stylistically there are no camera movements no interesting edits nor any signature touches and most of the film is disjunct rambles by chomsky videotaped huzzahs of chomsky declaiming on this or that and slackjawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him this is really poor filmmaking by director and editor will pascoe who in the dvds filmmaker statement shows hes yet another uncritical acolyte of chomskys other than that one of the surest signs that this is not an objective documentary but mere agitprop and a vanity piece of agitprop at that is that not a single time is chomsky shown struggling with an answer he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no boundsbr br given that much of this dreck was filmed during chomskys lectures at mcmaster university in ontario canada prior to the american invasion of iraq in 2003 much of what chomsky says seems as remote as things from the vietnam war era yes he makes some good points here and there on american media complicity before the war but he follows them up with sheer lunacy for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc and not fully plotted out cabals as example he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled similarly he claims trilateralists run the world and that peoples fear of crime is yet another cabals result of course that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers and all that wasted time and money district attorneys offices consume he also makes the absurd claim that cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades when castro and company were great sponsors of it in latin america asia and africa until the soviet union fell i can only guess that the ufo conspiracists are just waiting for chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up speciesmixing impregnation centers up in idahobr br in his simpleminded world without grays chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of bushco whom he reviles are even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals in short chomsky is a man living in the past in over his head on most issues and out of his depth intellectually near this films end he warns be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice yet one can only laugh as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he didnt like no matter how barbarous their crimes and antiintellectual their posit please pause before you waste your time and money on this silly and already irrelevant dvd
1,the real shame of the gathering is not in the bad acting nor is it in the despicably shallow plot the real shame is that it was far worse than the series it begun even though it did have one main attraction takashima i would love to see laurel takashima in a room with susan ivanova even for just five minutes she has that sarcasm that wit that doubleedged personality that is at once volatile and lovable sadly though the babylon pilot movie has an incredibly dull story involving assassination patricia tallman who never seriously returned to the series until much later fortunately got much better with age as lyta alexander who here is little more than a whiny tiresome telepath i shall leave you with one final thought why is it that delenn looks like some sort of outerspace frog man even though she is a woman thank heavens for the way the minbari looked later in the show
3,an attempt at crossover to appeal to those who dont appreciate opera exploiting the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time it fails badly all that is desirable in this movie is the opera and one can best find a recording of pavarotti doing what he does best the plot revolves around a romance with a doctor who heals his throat which has suddenly become troublesome br br only because it came out so long ago is it largely forgotten like most opera stars pavarotti is a decent actor and has stage presence aside from his singing talent and nothing that he does in this movie negates that opinion his culpability lies in not rejecting the horrid script perhaps because great operas can have silly stories he tolerated this onebr br who knows except those involved do we need to know br br the plot is weak and trite this movie is like trudging through cold mud to pick off a few juicy tidbits the opera music hanging above the mud we have other ways in which to appreciate the great pavarotti and this one isnt one of them just get one of his many superb opera or vocalconcert recordings and recognize the master tenor where he is most suitedbr br it would be one of imdbs 100 worst films if more people remembered it and gave it some votes it would fit neatly in a list including several efforts of singers actors models and athletes to exploit their popularity through film very often it all goes badly wrong due to incompetent acting or a horrible script pavarotti would have been a decent actor had he not shown such a superb voice however effective he is as an actor opera requires it not even jimmy stewart could have rescued this turkey of a scriptbr br i give it a polite of 10 because someone may have become a fan of pavarottis singing and of opera because of this movie
5,spectacular horror movie that will give you the chills once you get settled with it the atmosphere is very creepy and stylish the score is chilling but the best about the movie is its performances its rare to get scared by performances and this movies solid acting plays an important part in the scare factorbr br the story is very interesting and gets your attention since the first minutes though the woman in black does not have much screen time she makes the necessary appearances to chill the audience in some brilliant scenes the dialogs are very descriptive and make your imagination work and thats when it becomes really scary br br if you have the chance watch this on theater its a totally different experience but as scary as this moviebr br this is one of the best ghost movies ever and its directed for people that want to get scared
1,this movie provided nothing new or worthwhile after seeing it my wife and i both agreed that the studio simply churned this out and could have cared less if it was entertaining this is a good example of a concept only filmthey have a concept about a film and the other details are unimportant because execs know it will make  just based on the initial conceptbr br the movie starts with cruella getting out of prison and going on parole she no longer hates puppies but has been programmed to adore themshe simply couldnt hurt a flea this doesnt last too long after her release and shes back to her old ways periodbr br the most annoying aspects of the movie were the supporting characters eric idle as the voice of waddlesworth the bird made me hate himand that is tough considering i am a diehard python fan it was obvious he did this because they gave him lots of money there cant be any other reason cruellas low selfesteem servant tim mcinnerny was funny in the black adder shows but here he is totally wasted and unfunny and it must have cost a few bucks to get grard depardieu but he was utterly wasted as well there were some other supporting actors as well but given how poorly written the characters were i am trying to block them out of my mindbr br overall youd be better just to let your kids watch television than bother letting them see this drivel
6,not funny  how can anyone link this to monty python that is absolutely ridiculous  there are no laughs this is not funny over the top but ugly weird just for weird sake and it seems to me these people were on something all the time unfortunately something that did not make them funnybr br it should be given some points for effort etc whatever actually it appears there is a laugh track  or is there one hummm since there are barely any laughs thats a debatable questionbr br maybe im doing it injustice  maybe its some sort of exercise some sort of art  in that case anything goes never mindbr br but these guys playing women with highpitched voices turnedup noses come on  not funny br br there is only one heir apparent to monty pythons intellectual wit and that is stephen colbert and maybe jon stewart
4,it is a pleasure to see such creativity on tv again this show is poetic artistic and good fun the characters relate well and the writing is not bad i think it will improve as they get their legs definitely worth a lookbr br the girls steal the show so far in this series chuck is adorable as is olive the two aunts are a delight i sincerely hope they write them into bigger parts as they are magicbr br well thats all the news that is fit to print go make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy something fun in an old fashioned way this is like dr seuss for adults
2,despite a tight narrative johnnie tos election feels at times like it was once a longer picture with many characters and plot strands abandoned or ultimately unresolved some of these are dealt with in the truly excellent and far superior sequel election harmony is a virtue but its still a dependably enthralling thriller about a contested triad election that bypasses the usual shootouts and explosions though not the violence in favour of constantly shifting alliances that can turn in the time it takes to make a phone call its also a film where the most ruthless character isnt always the most threatening one as the chilling ending makes only too clear one can imagine a lifetime of psychological counselling being necessary for all the trauma that one inflicts on one unfortunate bystanderbr br simon yam all too often a variable actor but always at his best under tos direction has possibly never been better in the lead not least because tony leungs much more extrovert performance makes his stillness more the powerful
0,oh man why six degrees is a show about this so called theory that we all are linked by someone if focus on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actionsbr br when i first heard of this show it didnt caught my attention at all it seemed too ordinary actually then i saw some episodes and loved it first of all the characters they are all wellwritten and different from each other theres a alcohol addicted a woman whose fiance cheats on her a woman who just lost her husband a driver who has a troubled brother and so on unlike what were used to most of the characters interact with each other in casualties like in our daily routines great my favourite ones are mae carlos and whitneybr br then the cast they are all great jay hernandez from hostel shows here his acting habilities in a more 3d character than his previous work as paxton the other ones give great performances too specially campbell scott who plays steven and bridget moynahan who plays whitneybr br well when i came to imdb after watching some episodes i couldnt believe that it got cancelled seriously i cant understand the low ratingsbr br its too bad it didnt have more than one season it would really be a good show to follow
5,its interesting how the train of research can flow i started out looking at an article about cristos the gates in central park the article stated that the maysles had been cristos filmographers for years hmmm then i got to looking at their body of work i believe one of them has passed on but the other is still filming cristo and jean claude in their stages of creation grey gardens sounded very interesting video station in boulder co is the place to look for the obscure or offbeat and of course they had it in stock dvd and vhs edith and edie are women living in the past and oh what a glorious past it was edith had been well off born a bouvier married well had several wonderful relationships and became a singer when she was in her forties her daughter edie had been a dbutante a fashion model and had many beaus she never married and at some point in her thirties had come home to recuperate she seems to have a nervous disorder of some kind worrying too much about things it is only a shadow of the world they live in though because jackie o came and spruced up the place so her aunt and cousin would not be evicted it is a 28 room mansion that is worn down and worn out but in the film you will notice fresh paint on the walls if you look carefully at the newspaper clippings you see it was very much a dirty mess the outfits edie comes up with a very clever and creative the viewer gets the impression that edith likes to go nude but she doesnt in the movie edith was really quite beautiful and you can see the shadow of her beauty still as she sings tea for two edie too was a beauty in her day and quite attractive at 56 it was a good movie though not for everyone when the cat is urinating behind ediths portait she states  at least someone is doing what they want
3,in september 2003 36yearold jonny kennedy died he had a terrible genetic condition called dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa eb  which meant that his skin literally fell off at the slightest touch leaving his body covered in agonising sores and leading to a final fight against skin cancer in his last months jonny decided to work with filmmaker patrick collerton to document his life and death and the result was a film first broadcast in march that was an uplifting confounding and provocatively humorous story of a singular man not shying away from the grim reality of eb the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the full produced and directed by patrick collerton and first shown in march 2004 the boy whose skin fell off has become the most talked about documentary of that year it attracted nearly five million viewers and after the screening the public donated over half a million pounds to jonnys charity debra a jonny kennedy memorial fund has been set up to raise another half a million with the aim of ensuring that jonny kennedy left a one million pound legacy
4, bad at being intentionally badbr br this little gem shot straight onto the mst3k big screen while its obvious the movie isnt trying to be taken seriously hopefully that their goal anyway the movie is still plain bad hell it makes leprechaun in space look big budgetedbr br in short paint my muscle car prune colored
1,thats not the sound of bees thats the effect induced by watching this extremely long extremely boring badly acted movie how i ever made it through all 12 hours without falling asleep ill never know the plot is simple3 thoroughly unlikable morons talk about sex for 12 hours and you thought rohmer was deadly this is even worse if thats possible  i must really be a masochist if i could watch this entire movie without turning it offor killing someone
7,in spite of the great futuredesign touches the clever asimov premise and will smiths dependable cool performance this movie doesnt live up to expectations the clichs come thick and fast waking from a recurring nightmare maverick cop has his badge revoked by hardass lieutenant to list more would be spoiling it  you can see the end a mile off this movie is also stagebound  you never feel that you have travelled anywhere whats supposed to be a global disaster never leaves an obviously cgi chicago the robots themselves are good in closeup but the crowd scenes look more like bad disney the cgi is overdone again and again and if you can destroy the robots by smashing them why do they need to inject nanites you know its a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax it could have been great but its less than the sum of its parts mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty years
7,for a film that got little publicity and few people have heard about this was pretty good its another one of these modernday british crime films that are quirky snatch sexy beast etc its not wild like snatch but its interesting and it has some rough charactersbr br it also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show  not late  has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the firsttime viewer basically its about a lowkey british male who sends away for a russian mail order bride who winds up with the aid of two russian male friends providing a couple of big surprisesbr br ben chapin and nicole kidman costar and are very good as are vincent cassel and matthieu kassovitz as kidmans russian cohorts this is a different kind of film and wellacted kidman once again proves shes far more than just a beautiful face
5,one of scorseses worst an average thriller the only thing to recommend it is de niro playing the psycho the finale is typically of this genre ie overthetop with yet another almost invincible immunetopain villain i didnt like the 60s original and this version wasnt much of an improvement on it i have no idea why scorsese wasted his time on a remake then again considering how bad his recent movies have been im referring to his dull buddhist movie and all the ones with his new favourite actress the blond girl di caprio this isnt even that bad by comparison and considering spielberg wanted to do the remake could have been far worse
0,my boyfriend and i both enjoyed this film very much the viewer is swept away from modern life into old japan while at the same time exposed to very current themes the characters are realistic and detailed it has an unpredictable ending and story which is very refreshing the story is made up of miniplots within the life of several geisha living together in a poor city district i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a realistic romance or life in old japanbr br 
2,sorry guys ive already written my opinion of this movie but today was the first day i looked at some of the other reviews there are a quite a lot of people who agree with me but whats scary is that there are some people who seem to really like this movie i dont like to write nasty reviews or criticise other peoples opinions but i think its only fair to warn anybody out there who may be debating whether or not to see this movie this is not a good movie i really like movies and ill watch just about anything but this movie made it onto the incredibly short list of movies i watched and was happy to leave halfway through if you really are incredibly tempted watch the trailerthats the mistake i made because the entire movie is essentially in the trailerafter that there are no surprises just some shockingly bad dialogue to waste time i love michael vartan in alias and would hate to criticise him but i think its my duty to stop other people wasting hours of their life on a movie like this
1,an imagination is a terrible thing to waste  especially when you have talented actors writerdirector jones wastes no time in siding the viewer with his protagonist br br anyone who has shared an apartment with a slob will be crying with laughter anyone who has arrived while a meter maid places a ticket on your windshield will just plain cry weve all wanted to rip a terrible toupee off a mans head these are only snippets of whats in store when watching cross eyed a heartfelt film that should be a stepping stone for jones and his wry sense of humor both in front and behind the camera
2,you can give jms and the boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget but the movie is still subpar dont get me wrong b5 the series is by far the best tv series ever but if i was an exec seeing this movie i wouldnt have ordered the series i dont like ohare as an actor the costumes are silly and there are tons of cliches the same can be said for most of the first season with the exception of babylon squared and survivors bruce immediately put a fire into the series and it went on to be an amazing spectacle if you are a b5 fan and havent seen this movie see it if you arent a b5 fan dontyou wont want to watch the series
7,this movie was incredible i would recommend it to anyone much better than what i had already anticipated it was definitely a heartwrenching spectacular movie it is an amazing story with amazing actors and creators definitely another great movie with denzel washington shouldnt surprise anyone derek luke did a wonderful job as well
0,the movie is basically the story of a russian prostitutes return to her home village for the funeral of a sisterfriend there are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken but they are not fully explored the core of the movie is the funeral wake and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable apparently the movie is unedited the prostitutes journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud maybe thats supposed to impress us with the immensity of the russian landscape the village itself such as it is is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male the consort of the dead girl continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible most of the film is shot with a handheld camera that could induce nausea another problem for western viewers is that subtitles dont include the songs and laments of the crones dont go to this movie unless youre fluent in russian
6,monty berman and dennis spooner followed up the baron with this a fantasy series about three superhuman spies which preempted the six million dollar man it was a favourite of mine when i was a youngster and i enjoy watching it still stuart damon and william gaunt had an unmistakable onscreen chemistry as craig stirling and richard barrett while the luscious alexandra bastedo pouted her way through her role as sharron macready the late anthony nicholls made a wonderfully gruff tremayne by far the best episodes were those written by tony williamson terry nation and brian clemens while spooners own the interrogation compared favourably with the prisoner i regret that there was never a second series the concept had so much life left in it would craig and richard have been competitors for sharrons affections what if tremayne had learned of the champions powers did the champions have any other abilities other than those we saw we never found out alas

6,soapdish may go down as one of the single most underrated movies ever madebr br a stellar unselfish cast who understood exactly where the movie was going and the roles they played in it while everyone hammed it up there was no oneupmanship kline showed wit and great physical comedy goldberg and downey knew how to carry on a funny conversation while someone else was talking i could just go onbr br do not pass this movie by
5,everyone knows about this zero day event what i think this movie did that elephant did not is that they made us see how these guys were they showed their life for about a year throughout the movie we get to like them to laugh with them even though we totally know what theyre gonna do and that gives me the chills cause i felt guilty to be cheered by their comments and i just thought cal was a sweet guy even though i knew what was gonna happen you know even at the end of the movie when they were about to commit suicide and just deciding if they did it on the count of or i thought this was funny but still i was horrified to see their heads blown off of course i was i got to like them they were wicked maybe but i felt like they were really normal guys that they didnt really realize it but i knew they werebr br thats imo the main force of this movie it makes us realize that our friends or relatives or anyone can be planning something crazy and that we wont even notice it this movie as good as it was made me feel bad and thats why i cant go to sleep right now theres still this little feeling in my stomach butterflies
0,boris karloff and bela lugosi made many films together but on the whole interestingly enough karloff usually is the better man of the two the real exception is the black cat 1934 where karloff is playing the evil head of a devil cult and lugosi is seeking revenge on him for destroying his life but more usual is black friday where whatever his motive karloff is trying to improve brain surgery while lugosi is a murderous thug in the raven lugosi is a sadistic surgeon who blackmails karloff to assist his evil plans until karloff finally has had enough rarely are they both negative characters totally in the body snatcher karloff does kill lugosi but lugosi is trying to blackmail himbr br the one exception where they are both extremely sympathetic but at cross purposes to each other is this 1936 film which i feel has rarely had the audience acceptance of some of the other movies i have mentioned in it karloffs dr janos rukh is a hard driven scientific genius who has been sneered at by the official scientific community for his theory that a rare form of radium is in nigeria on a meteorite that landed centuries ago he has finally gotten the support of a well financed expedition led by sir francis stevens and his wife lady arabella stevens walter kingsford and beulah bondi and has another scientist a frenchman named dr felix benet lugosi rukhs young wife diane frances drake and a friend and protge of the stevenses named ronald drake frank lawtonbr br before they leave rukh is warned by his mother violet kemble cooper that he is possibly seeking wisdom that he shouldnt and it may end in tragedy he tries to dismiss this but he is worried by what she says his scientific standing and whether or not he is going to get his due creditbr br what he gets is a disaster he finds the substance but is infected by its remarkable radioactivity he finds that he is slowly burning up and if he tries to touch people or animals they die hes actually built up a friendship or understanding with benet who figures out a type of radioactive fighting cocktail for rukh to use to counter the danger but there are two things that are unbeatable here the antidote can only last for a certain amount of time and has to be replenished and the radioactivity has affected rukhs brain he is increasingly jealous of dianes friendship with ronald encouraged unfortunately by sir francis and lady arabella and he is equally upset that due to his having to pretend to have died  the effects of the radioactivity are like that benet and several others are collecting the kudos of the wonders that radium x is giving to man soon rukh is on a murderous rampage that destroys many lives ending with his ownbr br the film certainly picked up on science to an extent madame curie had died recently from cancer she got due to work with radium few fully understood the dangers of radioactivity in 1936 but some idea of it was coming out the wave of murders by rukh cause the newspapers to talk about a curse on the expedition of course with the idea of a cursed expedition on the continent of africa for a hidden treasure buried centuries ago financed by a titled englishman we have entered archeology not physics or geology paging howard carter and lord carnaevonbr br on the other hand benet tries to settle the cause of the string of deaths and reverts to an idea that was actually demolished in 1888 in england during the whitechapel murders sir charles warren ordered the retinas of several of the dead victims to be photographed to see if the last image on the retinas was jack the ripper it turned out he only got the photographs of the retinas of dead prostitutes but the idea did not die jules verne used it in his novel the brothers kip in 1899 and here dr benet uses it as this is a science fiction story he finds the image of rukh on the the plate but benet drops the plate accidentally and it shattersbr br the film is good on many grounds the most interesting that for a change karloff and lugosi are not unsympathetic towards each other there is a type of tragic fatalism in this story that is missing from their other films the other performances are good as well in particular ms kemble cooper she is best remembered as basil rathbones frightening sister jane murdstone in david copperfield here her final act is the only way to bring this tragedy to an end and who can say it did not hurt her more than her target
6,as i watched one of orson welles last contributions to hollywood as a filmmaker i knew i was watching a great movie unfold though at times i did not know why the story in the lady from shanghai has the prime elements of a filmnoir averagejoe lead femme fatale conspicuous supporting characters and a comprehensible if somewhat convoluted plot structure it is an entertaining ride and its filled to the brim with welles unique gifts as a director but there are scenes that tend to just not work or dont feel complete in what was welles full vision the latter is unfortunately too true executive producer harry cohn and the columbia execs are to blame for thatbr br welles costars with his then wife the profoundly gorgeous rita hayworth as mike ohara an irish worker who can and does get angry at the right people hayworth is mrs bannister married to mr bannister everett sloane who played mr bernstein in citizen kane who is accompanied by a friend mr grisby glenn anders who has great control in his eyes they want to go sailing on their yacht and take ohara along for the ride and at first hes reluctant but agrees since hes falling for the married mrs as their journey unfolds ohara finds that bannister and grisby are not pleasant to be around and more so with grisby who at first seems out of his gourd yet as the plot unfolds ohara is drawn into a scam that grisby is planning for insurance money with results that i dare not reveal although they have been discussed over and over by othersbr br whatever liabilities pop up here and there in the mystery part of the story and those few noticeable moments where shots were studio dictated the performances and the look of the film are what remains striking after over fiftyfive years though he doesnt have the terrific greg tolland kanes dp at his side dependable charles lawton jr assists welles in creating an atmosphere that is both elegant and stark covered in shadows deep focus low angles the works a particular accomplishment is the funhouse mirror scene which is merely a highlight among others welles himself is always dependable as an actor even if his accent isnt anything special and hayworth herself makes a scene a little more lush despite her path in the story br br the lady from shanghai is worth checking out especially for welles hayworth or filmnoir buffs fans of the coen brothers might find this fascinating as well it may just take a little while repeat viewings as was for touch of evil for the underlying motives in the plot to sink in
7,i almost did not go see this movie because i remember march of the penguin was not that much exciting i went mainly because disney promised to plant a tree if i go see it on the opening weekend but after i did go see it it was simply amazing the fact that the photographers can capture impossible images are simply worth your money you also get to see different habitats different vegetation animals and natural phenomenons that will not only shock you  simply because you would never expect nature to be so magical and dynamic  but also touch your souls and raise the question of humanity versus the world of how our lives have deviated from nature to such a degree that we take for granted of the natural beauty and miracles that are quintessential to our biosphere you dont have to be an earth lover or a treehugging environmentalist to appreciate the mere awesomeness of this documentary you simply have to be a curious soul who questions the value and miracle of living enjoy

3,hey look deal with it there are much better portrayals of the hardship of black america than this although i think this story is weak my criticism is focused on the poor execution of the story which i have mentioned blowsbr br this was made in the mid80s and is horrible in the musicscore department its funny to see oprah as a latterday crackwhore typebr br the scene where bigger stuffs elizabeth mcgovern into the incinerator pure classic cinema first off i dont care how drunk you are you will react to 1200f degree flame no matter how bad your acting but they really milked that sceneit was comical ill tell you what though i had great satisfaction in seeing elizabeth mcgovern burn in a faux death she annoys me
7,tries to be funny and fails miserably the animation is just terrible looks like a year old threw it together in his sleep plot is dull and cliched if you have a young child maybe rent it but dont waste hard earned money to pay to see itbr br 110
2,this is one of the worst movies ever made trite predictable flatbr br the only thing that rated one point was there was a few nice scenes highlighting barcelona i imagine they would use films like this in guantanamo or some other hidden ciansa prison to torture suspectsbr br often bad movies have some redeeming features this has nothing if i was in it or worked on it i would change my name truly a turd hard to write more than this but i feel the worlds film watchers needed a heads up on this on the other hand it will make a great gift for people you cant standbr br you could send it to politicians you dislike in laws exwives teachers you hated former employees dick cheney w and a host of others
5,i shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad that has been done in great detail already many times over the plot started out as a very uninspiring cockney wideboygangsterbynumbers bore and very quickly descended into an utter shambles anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves it is now or years since i watched it during its week run at the cinema before it was pulled yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film i have ever seenbr br i am only making these comments and indeed the only reason i went to see the film is because of the amusing fact that my brother eddie appeared in it as the second heavy in the pub scene it was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards rhys ifans face in the bar in russia it was actually filmed at the former butlins holiday camp at barry island my brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever  he had recently joined an extras agency and this was his first part having seen the film it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoeverbr br i remember there were about people in the whole cinema  and this was just a couple of days after it had been released i have never heard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast  and rightly so in case you were thinking of renting this film on dvd i would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are redhot then jam them into your eye sockets this will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film
1,with the mixed reviews this got i wasnt expecting too much and was pleasantly surprised its a very entertaining small crime film with interesting characters excellent portrayals writing thats breezy without being glib and a good pace it looks good too in a funky way apparently people either like this movie or just hate it and im one who liked it
0,as far as i can recall balanchines alterations to tchaikovskys score are as followsbr br the final section of the grossvatertanz a traditional tune played at the end of a party is repeated several times to give the children a last dance before their scene is overbr br a violin solo written for but eliminated from tchaikovskys score for the sleeping beauty is interpolated between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the transformation scene balanchine chose this music because of its melodic relationship to the music for the growing christmas tree that occurs shortly thereafterbr br the solo for the sugar plum fairys cavalier is eliminatedbr br it seems to me the accusation that balanchine has somehow desecrated tchaikovskys great score is misplaced
6,i jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted remembering rahs and raves for it but wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary it backed off and went somewhere else the dripping water throughout the house the black rain the prophetic dreams taking the wrong turn in raw sewage were dropped before they could work up to a screambr br what a disappointment chamberlains nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief something i found myself mirroring as the film wore on what could have been eerie aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into ones head the ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods that the aboriginal peoples believe redhaired white men were the first priests and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension the dream timebr br spoiler in the final scene it wasnt clear to me what the director was trying to tell is there a big wave so what how big a tsunami yeah okay thats devastating but not apocalyptic is it the end of the world from a wave the last wave thatd have to be a pretty darn big wave why was the world that bad a place it didnt seem so awful in this movie actually i didnt think the wave came off since the shadow left burtons face that had been cast by the wave was it only burtons apocalypse heck that happens every day to people who lose it it wasnt of any interest if it was only himbr br the most frightening scene and the one that gives the best indication of weirs potential was in charlies apartment where burton has gone to confront the old man for scaring burtons wife charlie keeps asking him who are you and it becomes truly disturbing after a while unfortunately the movie never followed suit
2,based on one of the books by gabriel marquez and it might be brilliant literature this cinemaadaption really sucks as its more like fighting against sleep rather than enjoying some cinematographic delices the story is about an old couple whose son died and living a life that is heavily dominated by poverty and wherein the main character is a cock that hopefully one day brings some money for a forthcoming cockfight i am in no mood to spill more words on this useless pretentious piece just perhaps that you can see salma hayek in here but sitting 90 minutes in front of your screen for just that no gracias
6,i actually like the original and this film has its ups and downs heres just a fewbr br ups most of the original voice cast returnedbr br downs i didnt like the voice of timons ma i know she did a voice in the simpsons but that show is just plain stupid br br ups we get to see simba as a teenagerbr br downs they wasted it with a slugslurping contest between timon and simba br br ups it was rafiki who told timon about hakuna matatabr br downs how did pumbaa find out about itbr br ups songs again some of the original songs were there but they were just background musicbr br downs but stupid songs aka timons solobr br overall this is a pretty good movie id recommend it for fans of the original but if you dont like the original chances are you wont like this onebr br my score 710
7,this movie has lot of downsides and thats all i could see it is painfully long and awfully directed i could see whole audience getting impatient and waiting for it to end run time is way over hrs which could have been edited to less then hrsbr br transition between stories is average most people confessed being on seating expecting something better to come outbr br its funny only in pockets ambitious project and a below par execution govinda does a fair job anil kapoor disappointed me rest we as expected if u r expecting anything close to babel or love actually then its no where close
5,forgive me for stating the obvious but some films are good and some films are bad of course there are extremes within those two broad categories films such as the godfather saving private ryan and star wars slot comfortably into the good category at the other end of the spectrum there are those films that simply dont deserve to be mentioned by name occasionally however someone produces a truly woeful film a film that should be singled out as a demonstration of how awful a film can be a film that is more than bad such a film is maiden voyagebr br briefly maiden voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship that is hijacked by a gang of evil criminals who demand a ransom from an equally evil scheming ships owner of course there is an all american hero on board complete with chiselled jaw and sculptured chest who saves the daybr br this is a production that plumbs new depths everything about it is bad the acting the direction and the socalled plot are breathtakingly poor in short it is an insult to the intelligence of any unfortunate viewer even an american viewer would be annoyed by its shortcomingsbr br yes its that badbr br i will resist the temptation to compose a list of things that angered me about this film however its dumberthandumb conclusion should serve as an adequate example of what i meanbr br imagine in your mind that you are an evil hijacker and you are stood in an open lifeboat on a calm sea you are in company with the hero who holds a ticking bomb said hero throws the bomb to you and dives overboard what would you do i dont know about you but i would throw the bomb as far as i possibly could into the sea not this guy he watches as our hero swims away and then he tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate for him results enough said such a demise would merit a mention in the darwin awards website and might also be a suitably apt conclusion to the production teams lives
4,watching that lady in ermine i was wondering what betty grable was doing in a project that seemed to be aimed for marlene dietrich to do someone over at 20th century fox may have decided one sex symbol is as good as another darryl f zanuck should have known betterbr br betty plays a 19th century italian countess whose domain has been invaded by a troop of hungarian hussars captained by douglas fairbanks jr her ghostly ancestor whose portrait hangs in the palace hall along with the rest of her distinguished family tree sees no small resemblance in doug now and another invader some 300 years earlier whom she dealt with when armies failedbr br besides that the current betty has just been married to cesar romero and the invasion has come at a most inopportune moment before things have been consummated thats going to give anyone a bad attitude i guaranteebr br fresh wholesome all american betty is not the actress to do seductive and mysterious marlene dietrich might have put this over but with betty it falls flatter than yesterdays presidential candidate she and fairbanks have no chemistry at all though doug is as charming as ever and someone i can watch in anythingbr br frederick hollander and leo robin wrote the score for this film and this is the moment got an oscar nomination for best song that lady in ermines one chance for oscar glory fell to buttons and bowsbr br ernest lubitsch died midway during the film and otto preminger finished that lady in ermine i cant believe lubitsch had grable in mind for the lead here neither will you if you see that lady in ermine
0,i watched the unaired episodes online and i was so sad that the show wont be back it had the best cast of mature talented actors and an amazing chemistry it seemed like all the actors are personal friends in real life towards the end the show became engaging sexy and highly watchable of course some of the story lines are not realistic so what the characters are all likable and you root for them the show reminded me a cross between other favorites sex and the city and felicity big kudos to all the cast note to abc execs nielsen ratings reports do not show you true results the show audience will mostly record it ive been very disappointed with major networks for flooding us with realitytv or teenage oriented shows why to get a mature thoughtful wellacted material we have to switch to hbo or fx i can only thank the network for putting the rest of the episodes online the new stream media will gain more and more popularity among viewers
7,as we all know a romantic comedy is the genre with the ending already known the two leads always have to get together late in the third act i was trying to figure out how this will wrap up and how they will end up together a clue was given right from the start but youll never realize it until the end its a simple hook but it works it had to be you cover a lot of the usual ground but takes a fresh spin when ever possible i liked all the ny characters and i loved the locations its a postcard of ny also it was nice to watch a film and not find anything offensive in it so if you like a good old fashion romantic movie  then this is for you
3,this particular episode of smallville is probably the best episode to air since reunion this is for many reasons for example it takes the series back to some of its roots it welcomes back lionel from a supposedly long absence with the luthorcorp plaza office in metropolis this room hasnt been in smallville for a very long time and seeing it again brings back many memories from the smallvilles past not to mention lionels conversations with lex are always admirablebr br another pleasant return is well uv guessed it is bart allenaka impulse acaka aquaman and victor stoneaka cyborg not only does steven deknight reunite the former justice leaguers he blends them in with the smallville formula in such a unique way that it almost feels like it is a feature length moviebr br from there you get the basic story green arrow forms the league attempts to blow up 331 bart gets captured clark saves him and the facility is blown to kingdom com all is good and graceful with a good mix of stealth action pace and suspense oh and cyborg has some cool new upgrades true to the justice league character br br the music is probably what makes this episode work so well if you remember correctly the first episode steven deknight directed was agless from season this was a mediocre episode but something felt out of place maybe it was the music or the acting or the fact clark sais at the end we didnt find you you found us kind of made people lose faith in the formula but thankfully steve deknight redeemed himself in this justice episodebr br i had a few quivvles about justice that made it fall short of the full 10 first of all the far too cheesy exit of the justice league from the ridge facility expolsion i mean it would have been soo much cooler if say green arrow and cyborg took off on olivers bike rememeber from the arrow episode clark and impulse should have obviously ran and aquaman should have swam via another route but that was soo incredibly cheesy it nocked off points from the full 10br br secondly another cheesy moment not as bad as the first but when green arrow sais lets go save the world that made me cringe all in all judging by the acting performances music direction and production values the pros do outweigh the cons and this is still one of the best episodes in smallville history and maybe the 2nd best episode in season 6br br out of 10
7,the director tries to be quentin tarantino the screenwriters try to be tennessee williams deborah kara unger tries to be faye dunaway the late james coburn tries to be orson welles michael rooker tries to be gene hackman mary tyler moore tries to be faye dunaway older version cameron diaz tries to get out of the frame as quickly as she can successfully dont ask about joanna going eric stoltz and james spader try to conceal their embarrassment with this crappy stuff it delivers endless meaningless dialog and very little actionbr br tulsa is a town with beautiful elevator lobbies an art deco church by bruce goff and a lovely sprawling mansion by frank lloyd wright visit tulsa dont watch this movie it doesnt do the location justice
7,this is a better adaptation of the book than the one with paltrow although i liked that one too it isnt so much that beckinsale is better  they are both very good  but that the screenplay is better davies is a master at adapting austen for filming and the production values here are very good its not quite as glossy as the hollywood treatment but its close and i thought that the locations and the costumes actually worked better
7,at first i was weirded out that a tv shows main character could bring the dead back to life but then i thought id give it a shot guess what i love pushing daisies and look forward to wednesday nights just to watch it then for the next week i watch it a few more times on my dvr the colorful characters witty banter fastpaced dialogue and new unique situations draws me in and captivates from beginning to end ned and chuck charles relationship is interesting to watch as they work their romance around the fact that they cannot have physical contact even detective emerson cods character has continued to grow in complexity and olive snook jiminy crispies she cracks me up the narrators voice is fun to listen to and the cinematography gives me the impression that i am watching a movie instead of a tv show i have recommended my family and friends to turn on pushing daisies and they are hooked too the show is well worth waiting a week for a new episode and if you have not seen pd i highly recommend watching it
6,the daughters words are poetry i cant go on another year i got to get to a hotel room i lost my blue scarf in a sea of leaves the marble faun is moving inhe just gave us a washing machine thats the deal im pulverized by this latest thing raccoons and cats become a little bit boring for too long a time any little rats nest mouse hole id like better and there is wisdom in the mothers words yes the pleasure is all mine this little book will keep me straight straight as a dye always one must do everything correctly where the hell did you come from bring me my little radio ive got to have some professional music im your mother remember me the motherdaughter relationship is drawn in this magnificent film this is a mothers day film
7,while not as wild and way out as some of takashi miikes later films this is a very good crime drama br br the basic story is the story of a cop of japanese cop with chinese parents trying to take down an up and coming chinese mobster complicating things is that his younger brother is acting as the lawyer for the villain and his gang the film is actually much more complicated than that with several complications which both keep things interesting and distract things from the central narrative thrust its this complication and loss of way about an hour into the film that makes this less than a great filmit is a very very good one this is definitely worth seeing especially if you dont mind a no frantic pacebr br a word of warning the violence when it happens is explosive and nasty there are also semigraphic depictions of gay sex if thats not your cup of tea proceed with cautionbr br or out of 10
6,this production has absolutely no storyline the acting is embarrassing the promising dutch television sophie hilbrand star should not add this movie to her cv her acting is far from flawless and personally i think she has crossed boundary of professional decency relating to the way she exposes herself in this movie this movie contains too much unnecessary nudity vulgar sexual scenes and rude language it also shows a wrong image of the netherlands as most movies do do not bother to watch this movie a waste of time a waste of money and an embarrassing record for hilbrand who has proved to be better with her close on on the screen
2,this woman who works as an intern for a photographer goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling so she goes to find out that her neighbor above her is a photographer this movie could have had a great plot but then the plot drains of any hope the problem i had with this movie is that every ten seconds someone is snorting heroin if they took out the scenes where someone snorts heroin then this would be a pretty good movie every time i thought that a scene was going somewhere someone inhaled the white powder it was really lame to have that much drug use in one movie it pulled attention from the main plot and a great story about a photographer the lesbian stuff didnt bother me i was looking for a movie about art i found a movie about drug use
6,i have nothing against a fastpaced frightflick but this stephen kingderived nonsense is too freshlyscrubbed too bright and modern the plot about a new teenage boy in a small town who is a sleepwalkersort of a cross between a vampire and a werewolfand who feeds on the blood of female virgins begs for a more mysterious ambiguous treatment this thriller is given an inappropriately colorful look and feel with hardly any atmosphere the kids are predictably pretty and energetic but the big plus is alice kridge as the boys mother kridge from ghost story never broke out of the fillerfemale mold and its a huge loss that she hasnt been used more her performance is creepy and intense and gives hint that sleepwalkers mightve been a much better film with a different focus and tighter direction its too overthetop and commerciallydriven with an uneven tone that swings wildly from thriller to comedy to drama stephen king pops up in a cameo as do reallife directors john landis and tobe hooper 12 from 
7,despite loving rita hayworth finding the final few sequences of the film intriguing and being able to appreciate some of the subtler symbolic aspects of the cinematography the lady from shanghai didnt quite work for me i had a problem with most of the performances the script and the overall structure and in a film thats mostly people talking with each other in various situations thats quite a problem the lady from shanghai ended up at a very low c or a for mebr br the lady from shanghai is really all about orson welles character michael ohara ohara sees elsa rosalie bannister rita hayworth in central park on a carriage ride and hits on her later he saves her from a mugging and she takes a shine to him ohara is a seaman from ireland and the globetrotting elsa happens to own a yacht with her husband arthur everett sloane a very famous and powerful california defense attorney they talk ohara into working for them despite his initial reservationsit seems to him and to the audience that elsa is just looking for someone to have an affair with and ohara doesnt want to get involvedbr br shortly after going to work on their yacht a strange man george grisby glenn anders who says hes arthurs partner shows up at a port of call and begins stirring up trouble eventually grisby asks ohara to enter into a very dubious and dangerous scheme foolishly ohara agrees naturally it gets him into quite a bit of trouble and eventually a number of mysteries are revealedbr br maybe my problems with the film lie in the fact that so far im not exactly a huge fan of orson welles and here he produces writes directs and consumes most of the screen time i havent seen anywhere near the majority of welles work yet but ive tended to like his later films better when he became a bit more campy and performancearty i love f for fake vrits et mensonges 1974 for example and i even kind of like his performance in casino royale 1967 when he bizarrely insisted on being allowed to do magic tricks at a baccarat table but citizen kane 1941 never did much for me despite giving it or chances over the years including about one year ago my rating was a low 7the same as my current score for the lady from shanghaibr br welles performance and the dialogue hes written for himself come across as affected and pretentious to me hes a bit of a motormouth a bit of a boor and a bit monotonehe tends to sound like hes reading his performance reminded me of what ive seen of welles version of moby dick listed on imdb as 1999 but completed in 1971 it can also be seen in orson welles the oneman band 1995 where he seems to be just reading to the camera and believing that hes inherently sublimely dramatic im also someone who almost never complains about accents but somehow welles manages to make his irish accent sound affected and pretentious to me toobr br as for the other performances i can only say i thought hayworth did an excellent job of course shes gorgeous which doesnt hurt plenty of eye candy here like welles sloane also seemed a bit affected and pretentious to mei never quite bought his character his handicap and so on and anders is simply bizarre where bizarre doesnt seem to fit welles often shoots him in closeup and anders almost always has some overexaggerated manic expression on his sweaty facebr br structurally the lady from shanghai is very uneven the first 50 minutes or so are extremely bland and soapoperatic although the soap opera ministrations tend to be approached from a tortuous oblique once grisby introduces his scheme things pick up a bit and mostly improve as we near the end but by the time the lady from shanghai becomes a crimemystery film its too little too late and it quickly turns into a courtroom drama before the sudden thrilling ending that comes almost out of nowhere and is over far too quickly for its relative excellencebr br the ending is more actionoriented lessdialogue heavy more varied and exotic in settings and at times fairly abstract welles handles that combination of material skillfully as a director if the lady from shanghai would have been a largely a combination of the crimemystery stuff and the arty ending it could have easily been at least a the final scenes are easily 10s as welles shifts from a hitchcockian suspense scene in a san francisco chinese opera house to another suspense scene in a chinese amusement park the funhouse climax uses cinematography that was experimental for its time its well integrated with the script as it allows a complex resolution and fuels a lot of symbolismbr br the cinematography throughout is interesting even if it usually cant make up for the problems in the foreground welles blocks scenes with skill there are lots of attractively filmed settings from central park to acapulco to various san francisco locations welles effectively creates symbolic backdrops for his action from the emphasized heights and precipitous drops of acapulco to the mazelike caribbean streets the beautifully framed and silhouetted shots of the san francisco aquarium and so on the romance material for which the aquarium serves as one backdrop is interestingly tempered with a kind of unease throughout the film but on the other hand that makes the romance never quite work as romancebr br surely serious welles fans will appreciate the lady from shanghai much more than i did and of course its worth a watch if you love rita hayworth the lady from shanghai isnt exactly a terrible film in my view but its dangerously close to not passing proceed with caution
6,heres another movie that should be loaded into a satellite fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity this movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a ripoff of the already bad movie classic king kong from 1976 that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness but successfully predicted much of peter jacksons miserable 2005 computer cartoon bearing the same name as far as a romance between the giant here a yeti and a gorgeous human female antonellina interlenghi of umberto lenzis city of the living dead who is very easy on the eyesbr br the film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex  the yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness but as a tradeoff you do get a wacky old scientist two inquisitive kids tony kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure dog adventure movies were big in europe for a while and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the yeti who turns out to be the good guy glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands a monster whos size literally changes scale from shot to shot some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in godzilla vs the smog monster look tame by comparison crowd reaction shots aplenty made up of either spanish italian or canadian extras depending upon scene you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey moviebr br its here that the film won me over its enthusiasm just for being made frank kramer is actually the same gianfranco parolini who brought the world sartana in 1968 and gods gun the year before this  was a very important director in the spaghetti western and actionadventure genre film scene from the 1960s1970s and by the time of yeti he was probably delighted to get the work i would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever or rather the one he took the most chances with and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids  families the movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless or rather they are part of the fun and if the movie had been played seriously it wouldnt have worked  which is exactly why peter jacksons movie sucked br br he forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid power macintosh pod people animators and with all its faults  clunkiness kramers yeti is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space id rank this up there with king kong versus godzilla and it curse of the great golem as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever because the movie looks so fake you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked trampled tossed about and smashed knowing that and armed with a fertile energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie i will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend this is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloidbr br 1010 its about ten minutes too long but who cares you only come around once and id rather go out with a smile on my face
2,this movie was the worst movie i have seen since date movie i was laughing through out the whole movie instead of being scared it was funny how the snakes would search for particular section of the passengers body to attack for example the eye the tongue the butt the breast if we have seen national geographic channel we know snakes wont stay clinched on the body once they bite for each particular scene the snakes would bite the passengers and would stay on the body biting the person i believe the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior i cant believe i wasted my money on this movieso i dont recommend this movie trust just wait until it is at the dollar theatre or rent it
1,i am a big 1930s movie fan and will watch most anything that i see on turner classic movies thats new for me so i gave this a shot after all its the great harold lloyd who rivaled chaplin as a great silent film comedian i have watched much less of lloyds silent films then of chaplins but i have to say im a much bigger chaplin fan anyway this film fell so flat for me that i didnt finish it i can understand why his sound career was so limited he didnt get very good material to work with after youve seen chaplin abbott and costello the three stooges martin and lewis the marx brothers and laurel and hardy do boxing spoofs or violence in general this one is very forgettable i was also interested in watching adolphe menjou as i really enjoyed him in paths of glory but his role here also did nothing special for me maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film at least it seemed that way is before he gets in a ring i can tell there are a lot of lloyd fans here and this wont be a popular review but i must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time out of 10 dont watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again very flat for an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general i recommend kelly the second made a few years earlier another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with patsy kelly and in a supporting role charles chase these have both been shown on the turner classic movies channel
7,scary yes scary jampacked with nudity from fat people to skinny people maslin beach takes place on a nudist beach in sabr br i first saw this film two years ago  its safe to say it made a bizarre topic of discussion at school the next day this film was horrible hardly a romantic comedy  just a showcase of nudity this movie hit its lowpoint with one of the newage characters staring down between a girls legsbr br girl youre not going to find god in there guy nah but i think i found heavenbr br steer clear of this one unless you want to hear amateur actors discuss topics such as farting adultery and the process of superlguing ones genitals together avoid
5,at first glance this movie has got everything a psycho wants a vampire story with a not under 18 restriction filled with hyperviolence drugs gore sex including lesbian sex some fanatics zealots and even a gay necrophiliac cop but then this movie is a succession of bad story so thin bad acting with a ridiculous english accent making you believe youre watching a bad monty python  bad music 80s hard rock the videotaping is awful the ending is a real shame plus the scenes of sex are ridiculous the gore not very impressive and those vampires reflect in a mirror and dont even fear daylight you get to be very disappointed unless you see it as a space mutiny or troll i hope bloodlust will one day reach the bottom 100 because thats its real placebr br id say it can still be fun to watch if you have friends and enough beerbr br 310
1,prison is not often brought up during conversations about the best eighties horror films and theres a good reason for that because its not one of the bestbut as you delve past the classic films that the decade had to offer this is certainly among the best of the lesser knownsmaller films the film does have some connection to blockbusters for a start its an early directorial effort for renny harlin the capable director behind a number of action films including die hard cliffhanger and deep blue sea and secondly we have an early role for lord of the rings star viggo mortensen the film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting we focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years this was the prison where a man named charles forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being framed by the prisons governor naturally the spirit of the dead man is not resting in peace and when the old execution room is reopened the spirit of the dead convict escapes for vengeancebr br the film is not exactly the shawshank redemption but it does take care to build up its various characters and while the main point of the film is always the horror the prison drama behind it all does make for an interesting base this is a good job too because other than the basic premise the film doesnt really have a plot to go from and we solely rely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting the horror featured in the film is at times grotesque but its never over the top which might actually be the reason why this film is seldom remembered being released in a decade of excess the murders themselves are rather good and imaginative however and provide some major highlights as the film goes on we start to delve more into the backstory of the vengeful convicts ghost and while its fairly interesting some things about it dont make sense and it drags the film down a little still everything boils down to an exciting climax and overall i have to say that prison is a film well worth tracking down
4,i rented this movie the other night because neither my girlfriend or myself had ever seen it even though we had heard from a mutual friend how great it wasbr br now i am pretty conservative in my views but i knew going in it would be pretty liberal given who directed it i figured before the movie started michael douglas would play a compassionate popular liberal beloved by the masses and there would be a stodgy conservative opponent as his antagonist but i thought thats where the political statement would begin and endbr br ok the plot was solid single president falls for a lobbyist ok this has potential i thought to be pretty entertaining since the plot was unique but then the movie turned into a liberal infomercial the movie became more about gun control and environmental issues than it did about the relationship between the president and sydneyannette beningbr br there were several ridiculous premises in this movie the character sydney playing this six figure lobbyist who is a closer could she have been more flighty she was constantly disorganized and seemed in awe of everything hardly a closer i am an sales and she could not close selling a glass of water to a man dying of thirstbr br secondly is there anything more ridiculous than richard dreyfuss playing a right wing fanatic this is the most liberal man in hollywood and her is playing some right wing ideologue give me a break i liked how he took his conservative character and made him as sinister as possiblebr br the speech at the end was simply ludicrous the line about i am a proud card carrying member of the aclu was a joke first no president would ever admit something like that being an active member of an ultra fringe group second why even bring something like that up you just alienated off over half the movie going audience who is moderate or conservativebr br i thought the plot was great and unique i thought michael douglas was a good choice as president but the movie went from being a movie to a left wing political statement which is why the movie failedbr br its a shame to see a great plot ruined by hollywood having to force their political views on the audience
7,theres the danger with the criticphilosopher slavoj zizek with his film directed by sophie fiennes which takes together a wonderful amalgam of silent horror scifi surreal and other contemporary thrillers together to make his points ofr freudian comparisons to overload but in the perverts guide to cinema he also makes even the more farreaching points a point of departure from any other analysis ive seen on a collective section of films while it doesnt cover the expansive territory scorseses movie documentaries cover the same attachments are there and zizek has a definite love for all of these perverse examples and films primarily the work of hitchcock lynch chaplin and tarkovsky yet one shouldnt go into seeing this if you can find it that is i got to see it almost by luck thinking zizek will just try and dissect all of the psychosexual parts or parts referring it in an obtuse deranged manner if anything he opens up one to points that might never be considered otherwise would one think of three of the marx brothers as representations of the id superego and ego harpos example is most deadon for mebr br hes not just one to take on the classics though he also considers the food for thought in the matrix and fight club in representations of the split between fantasy and reality and if the matrix needs the energy as much as the energy needs the matrix for the former and in the attachment of violence in dealing with ones own self as well as ones double in the latter he even throws in a piece from the pivotal moment in revenge of the sith when anakin becomes darth vader and the implications of shunning away fatherhood under that back mask at the very moment his childrens births happens elsewhere the ideals of fatherhood male sexuality the male point of view in turning fantasy into reality at which point zizek rightfully points to as the moment of a nightmares creation and female subjectivity are explored perhaps most deadon with vertigo this too goes for a scene that zizek deconstructs as if its the zapruder film where he dissects the three colliding points of psychosexual stance in the dont you look at me scene in blue velvetbr br now it would be one thing if zizek himself went about making these sincere excited and somehow plausible points just face on to the camera or mostly in voiceover as scorsese does but he goes a step further to accentuate his points of fantasy and reality and how they overlap intersect become one and the same or spread off more crucially into some netherworld or primordial feeling for some characters ie lost highway by putting himself in the locations the films take place in funniest is first seeing him in the boat heading towards the same dock tippi hedrens boat heads to at the beginning of the birds equally funny is as he waters the blue velvet lawn he goes on to explain the multifaceted points of frank booth only one when hes in solarislike territory does it seem a little cheesy but zizek seems to be having a lot of fun with this setup and after a while one bypasses the potential crux of this gimmick and zizeks words come throughbr br there were some films i of course wouldve expected chiefly from hitchcock and lynch but a treat for movie buffs come from seeing two things the movies that one would never think of seeing in a film about films titled the perverts guide of cinema top two for me would be the disney pluto cartoon and the exposition on chaplins films albeit with a great note about the power and distinction of voice and the ones that one hasnt seen yet ie the ventriloquist horror film dr mabuse stalker among a few others that inspire immediate feelings of wow i have to see that immediately no questions asked zizek is a powerful writer with his work and puts it forward with a clarity that reminds one why we watch movies in the first place to be entertained sure but also to have that actual experience of sitting down and having something up there as he put it looking into a toilet its probably one of the greatest films about cinema and in such a splendidly narrow analysis of how freud works its way into films regarding desire the idsuperegoego and of the supernatural in fantasy that you may never seeunless distribution finally kicks in if only on the smallest levels
4,its this one very cool premise right off the batbr br has an excellent first scene gotta give credit where credits duebr br has solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me whenever the ghosts appeared which i really liked by the way how it was done how it lookedthe only thing was the ghosts relationship because of the way things went down in the first scene youd think their dynamic would be differentbr br things slowed down a little too much in the middle i felt and the crabspider scene was just not good but then the ending is actually very good sure the grudge basically told the same story with a polished lens but no samurais and thats what i liked about this movie comparativelybr br please someone one with a tempered style remake this moviebr br fans of silent rage would absolutely love this movie
7,without doubt the best of the novels of john le carre exquisitely transformed into a classic film performances by peter egan magnus pym the perfect spy rudiger weigang axel real name alexander hampel magnus czech intelligence controller ray mcanally magnus conman father and alan howard jack brotherhood magnus mentor believer and british controller together with the rest of the characters are so perfect and natural the person responsible for casting them should have been given an award even the small parts such as major membury are performed to perfection it says a lot for the power of the performances and the strength of the characters in the novel that despite the duplicity of magnus one cannot help but feel closer to magnus and axel than to jack brotherhood and the slimy grant lederer of us intelligence i have read the book at least a dozen times and watched the movie almost as many times and continue to be mesmerized by both if i had one book to take on a desert island a perfect spy would be the choice above all others
5,lindy meryl streep and her husband michael sam neill have just welcomed a baby girl azaria as seventh day adventists they live their beliefs every day and soon have azaria dedicated to god at their church with their two older boys looking on michael gets a vacation and the family decides to head to ayers rock one of the most impressive tourist spots in all of australia not being wealthy the family camps near the site after a wonderful first day lindy puts baby azaria to sleep in one of the tents suddenly she hears azaria crying as lindy rushes to the tent a dingo dog is just exiting shaking his head the baby is gone and soon so is the dingo although the entire camp looks for the baby she is not found concluding she is dead and that the dingo made off with their beloved child the chamberlains struggle to accept gods decision and go on with their lives but unfortunately the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale is circulated that lindy murdered the baby she is subsequently arrested and put on trial how could this happen this is a great depiction of real events that shows how mob rule is not a figment of the imagination the entire country turns against the chamberlains in part because they are seen as odd streep gives her best performance ever as the complex lindy whose own strongwilled demeanor works against her every step of the way neill likewise does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused michael the cast is one of the largest ever with depictions of folks around the country getting their digs into lindys case the costumes scenery script direction and production are all top of the line if you have never seen or heard of this film remedy that straight away it is not a far cry from reality to say that this cry should be seen by all who care about film and about the misused power of the media
2,amy heckerlings second film johnny dangerously is a parody of 1930s gangster films made in the warner brothers tradition michael keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935 keatons mother maureen stapleton has continuing health problems so keaton falls into crime at an early age via peter boyle meanwhile the fargan richard dimitri plays a rival crime lord to boyle and keaton eventually rises through the ranks joe piscopo has a hilarious turn as danny vermin yeah thats right vermin griffin dunne is keatons younger brother turned district attorney glynnis oconnor his wife and marilu henner plays keatons moll the film looks notoriously cheap making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical filmbr br the film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour due to the combination of dialog and gags the film holds its own for the first half but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half keaton chews the scenery doing his best james cagney impression stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious not funny piscopo does the once bit one time too many several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like danny devito dom deluise ray walston as a street vendor alan hale jr as a desk sergeant and sudie bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady the second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers the closing scene utilizing the roaring twenties is an anachronism as is the call of the wild clark gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film i think heckerling should have known better since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of the roaring twenties actual 1939 release date 12 of stars

6,this was another obscure christmasrelated title a lowbudget mexican production from exploitation filmmaker cardona night of the bloody apes 1969 tintorera 1977 which  like many a genre effort from this country  was acquired for release in the us by k gordon murray judging by those two efforts already mentioned cardona was no visionary  and this one having already received its share of flak over here is certainly no better the film in fact is quite redolent of the weirdness which characterized mexican horror outings from the era but given an added dimension by virtue of the garish color which in view of the prominence of reds  apart from st nick himself the devil plays a major role in the proceedings  throughout was essential anyway in a nutshell the plot involves satans efforts to stall santa claus christmas eve rendezvous with the earths children there is however plenty more wackiness along the way to begin with our portly whitebearded and chronically merry maninred lives in a celestial palace who apart from accompanying toymaker kids from all over the world on his piano as they sing laboriously for the whole first reel in their native tongue visits merlin  the famed magician at king arthurs court here bafflingly but amusingly prone to childlike hopping and mumbling gibberish  once every year to acquire potions which would bring somnolence to the young and render himself invisible by the way the wizards anachronistic presence here is no less unlikely than his being a cohort of dr frankenstein in son of dracula 1974 incidentally by this time he always seems to have gained some excess weightso santa has to work out in order to be able to fit into each proverbial chimney the devils antics enthusiastically rubbing his hands together at every turn and generally hamming it up to hold up st nicks delivery program then is perfectly puerile indeed their titfortat shenanigans resemble an old laurel  hardy routine more than anything to pad out the runningtime we focus on three sets of children one the lonely son of a rich couple who wants nothing more for christmas than their company projected as a wishfulfillment fantasy where the boy finds his parents wrapped in extralarge packages a girl from a poor family who yearns to own a doll of her own the horned one first tempts her to steal one then invades the little ones dreams  to no avail and a trio of brats who egged on once again by satan think of nothing but causing mischief and eventually fall out amongst themselves there is definitely imagination at work here but it is applied with little rhyme or reason while the overall juvenile approach keeps entertainment unless one counts the film as a guilty pleasure well at bay
1,whabam someone surely had fun devouring a whole truckload of acidmushrooms and then subsequently scripting this crazy excuse for a motion picture writer howard cohen expands the sword  sorcery concept with a couple of extra ss like sex silliness more sex and sheer stupidity this isnt just a movie this is every juvenile perverts dreams  fantasies come true deathstalker has it all blood violence trolls female mudwrestling attempted rape successful rape lifesized pigs  awful hairstyles hideously oiled muscular bodies multisexual orgies gay warriors tournamentstothedeath delirious witches dismemberment laughable villains and boobs boobs booooooooobies deathstalker literally wipes the floor with its obvious rolemodel conan the barbarian when it comes to terms of cheesiness and sheer flamboyance the story is evidently of minor importance lone and gay only he doesnt know it yet warrior deathstalker goes on a mission as commanded by an annoying witch to gather the three notorious elements of creation or something like that on his journey he combines forces with a trollturnedhuman a fighter whos even gayer than he is and  last but not least  a luscious lady who doesnt really seem to be a big support of the concept of bras together they head for the kingdom of the ultimately evil munkar where theyll participate in a warriors tournament and conquer no less than two out of three elements munkar is bald guy with half a spiders web tattooed on his skull and an impressive harem that would even make the wealthiest oil sheik jealous okay granted deathstalker is a pretty damn awful and at some times even unendurable movie the fight sequences are lame and the costumes and makeup effects are downright pitiable for a moment when beholding the opening sequence i actually feared i was watching troll the prequel the monsters look incredibly cheesy and the complete opposite as menacing but its undeniable entertainment if youre in an undemanding mood i presume this isnt a favorite amongst feminists as the overall portrayal of women is somewhat umdiscriminating most of the gals exclusively serve as eyecandy in the harem theyre allowed crawl over the floor naked and play around in the mud but strictly forbidden to open their mouths the two leading ladies barbi benton and lana clarkson are ravishing but  in all honesty  if it wouldnt be for their continuously exposed racks they would hardly be worth mentioning either
3,i loved this movie and i am one of the older people who is not supposed to enjoy it or so it seems no this movie is not deep  who cares these kinds of movies never are but strangely there is a message in it its that we each have the potential to be whatever we want to bebr br parker posey is great in this movie ive always thought that she bears some resemblance facially to katharine hepburn so its great to see that both hepburn and posey made movies about librarians hepburns is the desk set all librarians especially those with a sense of humor should see party girlbr br i gave this movie an it is not by any means a great film by cinematic standards although there are some nice shots in it but it is incredibly charming and entertaining
0,the only complaint i have about this adaptation is that it is sexedup things that were only hinted at in the novel are shown onscreen for some weird reason did they think the audience would be too stupid to understand if they were not shown everything outright other than that this is very goodquality all the actors do marvelous jobs bringing their characters to life for the shallow women out there its worth watching at least because toby stephens as gilbert is the sexiest thing ever if i were helen i would have conveniently forgotten i was still married the minute i laid eyes on himbr br sort of a spoiler the ending scene is a funny reversal of what happened in the book
6,i saw this recently and i must say i was moved by the factual basis of the story however holly as a movie did not quite work i am however looking forward to watching the documentary which the producers who organised this project had made because i think that would be a much more compelling work than this filmbr br the international cast was composed of bclass actors but their acting was appropriate and i must give a special mention for the young actress who played holly this was her first movie role and she did a very nice job considering hers is the most challenging part br br ron livingston was adequate but bland as patrick the american whose quest is to save holly but chris penn was good in this his final role unfortunately despite my mostly favourable opinion of virginie ledoyen and udo kier both of these actors were very much forgettable and did not do their best work in this filmbr br i believe in the films message and intention but i have to be fair so i rate holly stars based on its shortcomings as a movie but i think the subject matter deserves serious consideration and i am pleased that the people behind this movie have made a documentary as well which i hope will have its debut on bbc and other tv networks
5,japanese tomo akiyamas keko mask 1993 is extremely enjoyable trash film and so fun to watch there are also some sequels but i havent seen them since these films are hyper rare some kind of rereleases some day would be nice since i think many trash lovers would like these films the tongue in cheek story is about one extremely strict school in which teachers think that it is okay to torture students in order to attain discipline which is according to the teachers the most important thing in education the school is lead by incredibly funny looking just look at the costume human wizardwhatever who is like principal in the school and it only adds to the campiness that it is never explained why he wears such a costume since all other teachers are perfectly normally clothed well the main thing about the film is its name keko mask who is some beautiful and masked fairy who comes always to save the girls and students who are abused and tortured by the teachers yes this superheroine is one effective female as she kicks and fights the evil teachers with totally cheesy soundtrack playing on the background the most important thing is of course that she wears nothing but a cape and a mask with the rest of her body naked her identity is never revealed in these films and also the credits say keko mask unknown while the actor names are listedbr br the most hilarious thing in this film is how keko mask kills her enemies she has a gorgeous but lethal vagina yes you read right she kills her victims by flying in the air in front of them spreading her legs and letting the enemies become numbly charmed of the view after which she flies closer and snaps their necks with her legs the most usual last line the characters say in this film are like ive never seen such a beautiful vagina and now i can die in peace this film is totally fantasticbr br there are also some great taunts towards japanese society for example its attitude towards sex in films japanese censors optically fogblur all the pubic hair in any film and also about some restrictions among school students like girls and boys are not allowed to talk in this film etc theres one great scene in which one nerd sees girls bare youknowwhat for the first time and says hey theres no fog in it i couldnt help but laugh during this scene as i thought what do the japanese censors think about this also one character says in the end that he will return if japan films allows to make the sequel im glad it allowed as ive heard the sequels are equally outrageous one sequel should include blues brothers yes those blues brothers in it etcbr br this is trash in its most enjoyable funniest and also cleverest form and so it is a little shame these films are so hard to find this would definitely be even greater experience if it was little more fast moving at times as it becomes little boring at one point but fortunately those segments are very few this film has to be seen to be fully believed as there are so many trash elements i dont mention here and it wouldnt be even necessary to tell them all here if you like trash cinema and films made with tongue in very cheek i think youll love this little gem as i do and the director is definitely a genius in this field 810 perhaps the only film in which a shining vagina is this lethal
4,i could not take my eyes off this movie when it showed up on cable the dialogue and costumes are of a quality most readily associated with softcore porn in this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchuks perhaps for sex as well but not on indian tv anywaybr br not being a fan of the genre i couldnt place jeff wincott and had no leads to search from only once brigitte nielsen traded in her futuristicnurse coif so mayoral for the hightop fade we remember from beverly hills cop ii did i make the positive id on herbr br this movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of early 90s couture or nodandwink schlock  la paul verhoeven can we add a genre tag for sobaditsgood

0,after seeing this film for the 3rd time now i think it is almost adams worst film punch drunk love is poor in comparison to this i must say at the end when dickie gets thrown of the boat it is so funny the hair is different to his and i like it when he flips everyone off this film should only be brought if your a true adam sandler fanbr br the characters are poor in comparison to his funny films like the waterboy which has the same people in it peter dante who is one of the assassins trying to kill the australian birdbr br this film lack depth and a decent story line and deserves to be in the bottom 100
5,it has a great name but thats it and you wont get more than that for your money in fact the first 3040mins of the movie you might find it some kind of funny but after that the story goes from one side to another with no particular reason and you just cant understand whats happening until the action its gonebr br and yet the producers roberto angel salcedo calls him an actor but i dont think the way he does could be called nothing but overactingperiod the little kid who plays as his son has totally no sense of acting and i believe it was just a favor he did or something because he had no clue of what he was doingbr br for some reason while doing the casting they thought that by casting comedians they could made it but they didnt and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor its so bad i dont buy itbr br but hopefully this is as bad as it gets to make people accept those dvds to the good taste public they will have to offer some food with it that might work outbr br maka
4,i missed the first 10 or so minutes of the movie but dont think watching it from the beginning wouldve made any difference i found the film extremely boring and was disappointed with the acting i remember patrick swayze and some of the other actors roy marsden for instance in outstanding roles but they all disappointed here due to a very weak script kind solomons minesthe very short part of the movie inside the mines was about as exciting as watching paint dry and i doubt that even a preschool kid wouldve been spellbound by watching the fight of the warriors the entire movie was reminiscent of a cheaply produced american tv series give me indiana jones any day
2,the movie was a long awaited release which where a bit disappointing because of the expectations i had set up when looking at it again i must say it is actually pretty ok first of all is it very true to the original history of course not completely and is as such only made to keep the right for the movie modestys history as a child is shown and is very true to the original the acting is perhaps not the best around and the plot is a bit thin but when you compare it to the 1966 vitti movie is way better just because it is not trying to be a musical generally would i only recommend it to fans of modesty blaise or to someone who by catch it on the tv

1,br br this is definitely a must see for those who occasionally smoke a reefer in their secret hideout trying to avoid being caught by parents teachers the police etc the protagonist is a lady in her forties living in her mansion breeding orchids and absolutely unaware of the fact that her socalled rich and truthful husband is actually broke and cheating on her when he all of the sudden dies she is confronted with the truth the bailiff comes by to tell her that she is in a huge debt she doesnt know what to do until her gardener tells her about the recent success of marijuana in britain she decides after some long thinking to get rid of her flowers and start breeding pot instead the story is quite original the performances outstanding i can think of only a few movies that made me laugh more than this one still the melodramatic touch is present the film is typical british the jokes arent vulgar there is no violence involved it shouldnt be mentioned that it is recommended to have taken a few draughts before watching saving grace it will be so much more fun especially the scene with the old ladies in their tea shop is hilarious i thought my jawbones would burst 910

5,how tasty was my little frenchman tells a story that is alternately sad scary and lifeaffirming it ends with a brutal finale that you knew had to happen even though you were hopingmaybe even beleivingit wouldntbr br utlimately this is the films greatest strength it expertly plays with your emotions and expectations then drops a bomb on youbr br i saw this in a film theory class at usc back in the mid90s it is not easy to find but is definitely worth hunting for
5,this series was a cut above the rest of the tv detective series of the day but somehow didnt find an audiencebr br the idea of a blind detective may not be totally new but added so much to the story and who could forget pax the beautiful guide dog in the seriesbr br whilst the stories themselves may have been no better than the average series the settings  in new orleans the acting and the music i note the comment about the music score in other comments i remember that clearly all work to make a good television series even betterbr br well you never know one day paramount might just dig into its archives and release it on dvd
0,if i could have rated this movie by i would have  i see some ppl at imdb says that this is the funniest movie of the year  etc etc excuse me  are you ppl snorting lsd or  there is absolutely nothing funny about this movie n o t h i n g  i actually want my 27 minutes back of my life that i spent watching this piece of crap br br i read someone sitting on an airplane watching this movie stopped watching after 30 minutes  i totally understand that  i actually would have watched snakes on a plane for times over instead of watching this movie once  br br do not watch this movie  do something else useful with your life do the dishes  walk the dog  hell anything is better than spending time in front of the tv watching hot rod

3,an absolute classic  the direction is flawless  the acting is just superb words fall short for this great work the most definitive movie on mumbai police this movie has stood the test of timesbr br om puri gives a stellar performance smita patil no less all the actors have done their best and the movie races on thrilling you at every moment this movie shakes your whole being badly and forces you to rethink about many issues that confront our societybr br this is the story of a cop om puri  who starts out in his career as a honest man but ultimately degenerates into a killer the first attempt in bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about mumbai cops kudos to nihalani  br br after this movie a slew of bollywood movies got released that exposed the criminalpoliticianpolice nexus thus this movie was truly a trend setter this trend dominated the hindi movie scene for more than a decade br br this movie was a moderate box office hit br br a mustsee for discerning movie fans
5,i have always admired susan sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talents as an actor i therefor found it strange that she would appear in a film that so distorted that facts her characters rescue from the south pole was done by a canadian charter company from edmonton alberta flying a canadian designed and built twin otter aircraft the trip had been turned down by the us airforce navy and coast guard as beyond their capabilities the same company staged a similar rescue a few years later to bring out a man from the south pole base i feel that the film fairly represented a very gripping subject and documented a very courageous woman facing a frightening task i fail to see why the producers would find it necessary ignore the bravery of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as a usaf hercules
7,every great gangster movie has undercurrents of human drama dont expect an emotional story of guilt retribution and despair from scarface this is a tale of ferocious greed corruption and power the darker side of the fabled american dreambr br anybody complaining about the cheesiness of this film is missing the point the superficial characters cheesy music and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess nothing in the lives of these characters really matter not on any human level at least in fact the film practically borderlines satire ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of tony montanabr br this isnt brian depalmas strongest directorial effort it is occasionally excellent and wellhandled particularly the memorable finale but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled thankfully it is supported by a very strong script by oliver stone probably good therapy for him considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time the themes are consistent with the focus primarily on the life of tony montana and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power the dialogue is also excellent seesawing comfortably between humour and drama there are many standout lines which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or anotherbr br the cast help make it what it is as well but this is really pacinos film one of his earlier less subtle performances something much more common from him nowadays this is a world entirely separate from michael corleone and frank serpico yet he is as watchable here as ever in very entertaining and intentionally overthetop form it is hard to imagine another tony montana after seeing this film in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing but ive come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife not an exceptional effort but unfairly misjudged the supporting players are very good too particularly paul shenar as the suave alejandro sosabr br powerful occasionally humorous sometimes shocking and continually controversial scarface is one of the films of the eighties whatever that might mean to you an essential and accessible gangster flick and a popculture landmark 910
6,ive seen about four other japanese horror films and they werent too impressive however i could sense that there was a sensible script guiding the waybr br not here no way this is about a detective who is trying to tie together similar murders that have been happening when he finds a suspect to question the suspect freaks out because they keep seeing a ghost then the ghost starts to follow the detective around for a reason that is never explained and takes up more than half of the moviebr br bad enough oh no the film keeps switching perspectives to different characters who dont have much to do with the story ive seen this before in other movies where it shows a different perspective not the case herebr br also whatever is happening on screen that is actually tolerable quickly ends for example there a few scenes with a slight instrumental score that builds up andthen it just cuts to another scene im aware that this can be a dramatic effect thats definitely not the intention here its just bad editingbr br finally theres the ghost who just screams in a way thats not scary or unintentionally funny its annoying and it happens a lot throughout the moviebr br all of the scares have been done before in better ways so you can see them all coming then after one of them the movie is over at that point a wave of confusion swept over the audience as i could sense we all felt that we had wasted our time someone did a mock clap and laughter ensued it was better than the whole film simply put avoid
3,gespenster question of to be cool in the german cinemabr br there are not many german films in the last ten years who have made me so interest yes the problem of the most german films are in this film gespenster too he is on some places to uncooked to be good to see special the figure of toni sabine timento is too cool but thats is in german films always so everybody must to learns this coolne  is the realism in this films thats difficult to understand but in this case it makes some sense because she steals and she lies  she is the kind of girl is better you never love it because you lose it thats not clear for the other girl nina in this film she love her  and she would lose her but nina lost everything she will play with soft emotion and a sad feeling there is no way  but you must take it said herbert achterbusch for twenty years thats so often the way it goes in german films why nina julia hummer is not inside of the laws of society  the is outside  and there she have no chance this films tries not on every place to gave her a part inside thats one of the problems  the stupid break with conventions  the criminal fascination throw it all away  and go nowhere but the actress plays this difficult part very interesting on the other side  there the parents  who are the pendant to the two girls the have a car  a hotel suite  the have money and live in world with music of the opera but the film stand always in some distance to seem there is no much explaining of thembr br in the center of this film there is one scene you will never forget the two girls got to a casting and there they should say how they find together in this scene toni will lying on she said a fantastic storyhas nothing to do with her and then nina will say the truth she said it in an introversion way there is no exhibition in it she looks to the bottom and said what will happened for here thats a great moment in the next scene on the party with pictures in red this feeling is going on than toni goes awaybr br okay the film will end  in the german way of coolne  rubbish  here the circle of sadness is closing but there was a moment  where is happening something else  and this moment was important he is more than german coolne  and this moments are rare in the german cinema in this time
7,the film starts out very slowly with the lifestyle of wallace napalm an attendant at a photoservice dropoff station his wife has been restricted to her home with an ankle bracelet as the result of a sentence for arson wallace is a member of the volunteer fire department and takes firefighting seriouslybr br as we watch wallaces rather dull life proceeding suddenly there comes something new and jarring a traveling carnival comes to town one of its stars is wilder napalm wallaces brother hes a clown but he has a special talentbr br so does wallace theyre both pyrokineticists or pyrotics people capable of starting fires through mental energy wallace keeps his powers secret wilder lets his acquaintances know what he can dobr br spoiler some of their differences go back to a childhood incident where they inadvertently caused the death of a vagrant wallace holds back from using his powers wilder wants to go public on national tvbr br complicating the matter wilder wants wallaces wife whom they both dated years earlier she becomes a bone of contention and becomes one of the reason that the brothers finally have a literal firefightbr br the film is entertaining but not laughoutloud funny i think enough of it to have a copy in my library its a good offbeat film
5,i thought i was going to watch a scary movie and ended up laughing all the way throughout the movie in the scene where the human transformed to a werewolf i thought they was kidding todays computer games have ten times better animations low budget is a fitting comment i would recommend wolf 1994 with jack nicholson for a good werewolf movie it has good special effects as they should be human transforming to werewolf unless you wish to have good laugh i would not recommend you to watch this movie this movie is a joke
5,somebody needs to send this uli lommel guy back to movie school who ever told him he knew how to make a movie can just anybody make movies these days in the past it always required talent before someone could make a movie after watching this lame btk movie and the others hes made it seems blatantly obvious that the poor guy has about as much business making movies as i do actually i think even i could make better movies than uli lameall this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the btk killer other than the names of the victims and the killer thats it where did this guy get the big idea that btk killed people with rodents and all the other preposterous crap thats in the movie this is a classic example of someone trying to lure people into watching their movie based on the term btk because of the fame it has achieved absolutely pitiful the only serial killer movie i would consider worse is that lame dahmer movie that kid smoked so many cigarettes it made me nauseous whoever made that one needs to be shot
1,well ill be honest it is not exactly a sholay but you cant get a sholay every week in fact you could see distinct signatures of not without my daughtersally field 1991 in this movie however as most inspired movies go this one was a wellinspired one well handled and well done nana patekar as usual tends to overdo his hysterics but all others are commendable specially so about dipti naval saw her after a long time but she hasnt lost any of her grace in fact she has performed much better that when i last saw her another one of the bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they agebr br all in all a nice watch
2,one of the worst films i have ever seen how to define worst i would prefer having both eye balls yanked out and then be forced to tap dance on them than ever view this pitiful dreck again somehow onehit wonder zwick manages a film that simultaneously offends elvis fans mary kay saleswomen las vegas gays fbi agents and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a shoddy sloppy farce so forced it deserves to be forsaken ed how elvis presley enterprises could allow the rights of actual elvis songs to be used in a film with a central premise that seems to be the only good elvis presley imitator is a dead one is beyond me the worst part of this mess  and that takes some work  is the mangled script in 1958 elvis words and songs that he would speakperform in the 1970s are quoted worst special effect that oscar would go to the moron who decided that elvis grave potentially the most photographedrecognizable grave in the world resembles a pyramid with a gold record glued atop and is situated in the middle of a park somewhere potentially this films biggest audience would be elvis fans however the rampant stupidity nixon gave elvis a dea badge not fbi credentialsand i could go on and on actually undercuts that conventional wisdom ugh i used the word wisdom to describe this stupid movie this is truly a horrible horrible film
1,the king of masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship set in 1930s china during a time of floods we meet wang an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him when a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends wang he invites wang to join their troupe however we learn that wangs family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son learning that wang is childless wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever taking the advice to heart wang purchases an year old to fulfill his legacy he would teach his new son doggie the ancient art of silk masks soon wang discovers a fact about doggie that threatens the rare and dying artbr br together wang and doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it the story is absorbing the setting is serene and the costuming simple summarily it is an international award winning art film which cant help but to move and inspire
7,i didnt think it was possible for a horror comedy film to fail so abysmally on both frontsreally awful the fact that it doesnt take itself seriously usually a good thing works against it primarily because the actors are so wooden you really would swear they are reading cue cards on the upshot thoughthe mst3k version as always has a few laughs
7,i watched it some years ago i remembered it as very mysterious situations and a mixture of melancholic things like the fate of dorothy and the personal future of bogdanovichbr br i turn to watch on my vhs copy and then i was reviewing it more and more nowadays i am waiting for the dvd version at any price pleasebr br the country and easy listening music is very well chosen from the very first second a bit of blueish but also happybr br all the characters are great to me with funny situations great acting and a lot of dialogs that have turn this as a cult movie to me and a lot of people i met on the internet or cinema clubs this may not be casualtybr br i think that the title is a hope about life you have to be happy and laugh as much as possiblebr br i know that this may be a particular comment for the movie but the fact is that i like it very much i think that movie marked me and i will never forget it
7,nothin there aint nothing in room 237 but you aint got no business going in there anyway so stay out you understand stay out br br never has there been such a feat of psychological horror as this film achieves this is the highest rated horror film of all and rightly so jack nicholson is a superb actor and this is one of the greatest performances in cinemabr br its about a family moving to an isolated and deserted hotel for months over the winter then the father jack becomes almost possessed by the horrors in the hotelbr br kubricks direction is nothing short then perfect the tense tracking shots agonising music mystical messages and perplexing plot makes this the best horror film ever madebr br throughout the film there is constant references to danger death and horror red is used in every scene is the red purposely put in by kubrick of coursebr br this is a definitive kubrick classic and this is the third of his films i have given 1010 he is a perfectionist in his direction and you can see it in all his films he loves to perplex his watchers in everyone of his filmsbr br i will be talking about this film for months to come it has infinite depthbr br in conclusion this is the cornerstone of horror and tension a masterpiece of terror 1010
6,most yeti pictures are fatally undermined by a grave paucity of energy and enthusiasm not so this gloriously bent batty and berserk overthetop italianmade shotincanada kitsch gutbuster its a wildly ripe and vigorously moronic ghastly marvel which reaches a stunning apotheosis of righteously overbaked what the hells going on crackpot excess and inanitybr br a freighter ship crew discovers the body of a 30foot yeti that resembles a hirsute 70s disco stud complete with jumbo wavy afro perfectly preserved in a large chunk of ice they dethaw the beast jolt him back to life with electric charges grossly mistreat him and keep the poor hairy goliath in an enormous glass booth before you can say hey the filmmakers are obviously ripping off king kong our titanic abominable snowdude breaks free of his cage grabs the first luscious nubile blonde euro vixen the gorgeous pheonix grant he lays lustful eyes on and storms away with his new lady love the yeti gets recaptured and flown to toronto to be showed off to a gawking audience of course he breaks free again nabs the vixen and goes on the expected stomping around the city rampagebr br the sublimely stupid dialogue sample line philosophy has no place in science professor cheesy far from special effects the horrendous transparent blue screen work and cruddy tonka toy miniatures are especially uproarious in their very jawdropping awfulness clunky misdirection and a heavyhanded script that even attempts a clumsily sincere is the yeti a man or a beast ethical debate all combine together to create one of the single most delightfully ridiculous giant monster flicks to ever roar its absurd way across the big screen better still we also have a few funky offbeat touches to add extra shoddy spice to the already succulently schlocky cinematic brew the vixen accidentally brushes against one of the yetis nipples which causes it to harden and elicits a big leering grin of approval from the lecherous behemoth  the vixen nurses the yetis wounded hand while he makes googoo eyes at her the yeti smashes windows with his feet while climbing a towering office building and the furry fellow even breaks a mans neck with his toes  overall this singularly screwball and shamefully unheralded shouldbe camp classic stands tall as a remarkable monolith of infectiously asinine celluloid lunacy thats eminently worthy of a substantial hardcore underground cult following
7,i saw the trailer to this film and it looked great so i went out and bought it what a mistake the acting is a shambles the special effects if you could call them that look like something that wouldnt be out of place at a school play some of the characters are so stupid in this film you will cringe the minute they are on the screen which unfortunately is all to often as for a story forget it this is a warning dont waste any money at all on this film it has to be one of the worst things i have ever seen if for some reason you like this film watch troll you will probably enjoy that as well
5,this movie isnt worth the film it was photographed on the dialog is flat filled with clich overused lines and delivered by amateur actors who sound like their reading a script for the first time the choppy shaky film style is a cheap imitation of the the ring style visual effects the characters do not even act like a normal person would for example the character who is looking for her twin sister at her home forces her way through the front door creeps around the house all frightened and sobbing and she doesnt even once call out her sisters name to see if she is home what you would think she had just buried her sister instead of searching for her way too many flashbacks to her childhood too many unnecessary flashbacks is a typical sign of an amateur director it is actually funny watching the numerous shots of the woman driving her car down the street up the driveway around this corner over here over there oh a side view now a front view enough already you would think you are watching a tv commercial for the solaris terrible movie out of 100 i really pity anybody who spent money making this film or to watch it
4,james cagney is best known for his tough characters and gangster roles but he has also played quite a lot soft characters in his career this musical is one of them and it was the first but not the last musical movie cagney would star inbr br cagney is even doing a bit of singing in this one and also quite an amount of dancing and it needs to be said that he was not bad at it he plays the role with a lot of confidence he apparently had some dancing jobs in his early life before his acting career started to take off big time so it actually isnt a weird thing that he also took on some musical acting roles in his career he obviously also feels at ease in this totally different genre than most people are accustomed to seeing him inbr br the movie is directed by lloyd bacon who was perhaps among the best and most successful director within the genre his earliest 30s musicals pretty much defined the musical genre and he also was responsible for genre movies such as 42nd street his musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like than anything else really 30s musicals never were really about its singing this was something that more featured in 40s and later made musicals mainly from the mgm studiosbr br as usual it has a light and simple story set in the musical world that of course is also predictable and progresses in a formulaic way it nevertheless is a fun and simple story that also simply makes this an entertaining movies to watch so do the characters and actors that are portraying them sort of weird though that that the total plot line of the movie gets sort of abandoned toward the end of the movie when the movie only starts to consists out of musical number routinesbr br the musical moments toward the ending of the movie are also amusing and well done even though im not a too big fan of the genre itself once again the musical numbers also feature a young billy barty he often played little boysbabiesmice and whatever more early on in his career including the movie musical gold diggers of 1933 of one year earlier br br a recommendable early genre moviebr br 810
7,well i guess it supposedly not a classic because there are only a few easily recognizable faces but i personally think it is its a very beautiful sweet movie henry winkler did a great job with his character and it really impressed me
1,noni hazlehursts tourdeforce performance which won her an afi award is at least on par with her effort in fran three years later colin friels is also good and for those who are interested alice garner appears as nonis child and michael caton best known for the castle is a bearded painter also interestingly hazlehurst is currently the host of lifestyle program better homes and gardens and caton is the host of propertytype programs including hot property hot auction etc this film reaffirms the popularlyheld belief that noni was arguably australias top female actor during the earlytomid 1980s rating 79100
7,just watched this early bugs bunny first time hes named here and elmer fudd cartoon on the thadblog as linked from youtube this was chuck jones first time directing the wascally wabbit and as a result bugs has a different voice provided by mel blanc than the brooklynbronx one were more familiar with in fact according to thad hes channeling jimmy stewart his shy boy type personality of that time anyway after elmer buys his pet bugs goes all obnoxious on him by turning the radio real loud pretending to die after his master repeatedly throws him out of his shower and saying turn off those lights whenever elmer catches him in his bed even with the different voice bugs is definitely his mischievous self and i laughed myself blue the whole time according to thad there was an additional scene at the end of elmer just giving the house to bugs after the hell he went through but that was probably considered too sad since he suffers a mental breakdown at that point so its just as well that cut scene is lost anyway i highly recommend elmers pet rabbit

5,while being a great james arness western this film has gone down as the worst alamo film ever made the story was terrible inaccuracy all through it and just downright untruths to boot continuity was cast to the four winds anybody catch the cannon sequence the mexicans were dumb enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the tubes come on then there is brian keiths ridiculous hat costumer must of been away or something or just out of their mind
0,first of all i have to say i have worked for blockbuster and have seen quite a few movies to the point its tough for me to find something i havent seen taking this into account i want everyone to know that this movie was by far the worst film ever made it made me pine for gigli my bosss daughter and any other piece of junk youve ever seen belyt must be out of his mind ive only found one person who liked it and even they couldnt tell me what the movie was about if you are able to decipher this movie and are able to tell me what it was about you have to either be the writer or a fortune teller because theres any other way a person could figure this crap outbr br for the love of gd stay away
6,the movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of baghdad the jailed prince meets a thief called abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with but unbeknown to him the evil wizard jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns abu into a dog this leads to the prince and abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat jafa restore peace to baghdad and marry the princess during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic genies that takes abu on a flight through the clouds a giant spider thats really hungry and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seenbr br this is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses genies flying carpets and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs it doesnt have any cheesy moments and the love story isnt a waste of time the production designs are just stunning in this movie from the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter even though this movie is over 40 years old the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in todays cinema the music and songs are also well done anyone who sees it will no doubt hail i want to be a sailor sailing on the seas as one of the great musical moments in movies im usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since i find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but ill be more than happy to make an exception for this moviebr br what sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you dont see in everyday life which is also the same reason why i love stuff like two towers and silent hill way before todays modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic cgi to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place one of my favorite shots in two towers is the one where we see the trolls opening the black gates the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor and thats what i love about the genie and other creatures in the movie theyre just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though theyre all just fantasy beingsbr br its literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of aladdin got their inspiration the characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative genie right down to the flying carpet its not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since its nice to know that im not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie i first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week i still think its amazing thats a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time sure the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40s so give it a break not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under todays standardbr br if you ever wanted to see a live action version of aladdin then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this wont be their cup of tea
2,not that i tinkle myself with glee at the sight of realistic blood shed but when i put a dvd in expecting a bloodbath and what i get is one bloody scene the eyeball at the tail end of asinine fake slapping and spinning in a desk chair i end up thinking well thats 43 minutes of my life gone forever i wouldnt considers this or flower of flesh and blood movies so much as an exercise of will to see if you can sit through them flower of flesh and blood had a few tough spots to watch the devils experiment did not it was at best stupid and at worstwellreally stupid perhaps my expectation were too high i put the dvd thinking oh man this is gonna be sick after watching them fake slap the girl about a thousand times i was watching it in fast forwardbr br two kinds of people would be interested in this film people who seek out fd up films just to see how fd up it really is or horror completest i sought this and the other guinea pig films for the latter reason but even if i fell into the category of the former this film wouldnt float my boat as a matter of fact i could imagine this film increasing ones blood lustas in would you just kill the btch already so in conclusion the only reason to own this film is for collection purposes if you want carnage that traditional horror doesnt provide get traces of death sure that sucks too but at least youll get the blood and guts you expectbr br the only reason i can see for anyone praising this crap is because they feel theyre supposed to no artistic merit that i can comprehend no reason for its notoriety no nothing just a lame attempt to be shocking
0,awful awful awful no i didnt like it it was obvious what the intent of the film was to track the wheeling and dealing of the movers and shakers who produce a film in some cases these are people who represent themselves as other than what they are i didnt need a film to tell me how shallow some of the people in the film industry are i suppose im at fault really because i expected something like roman holidaybr br im not a moviemaker nor do i take film classes but it appeared to me that the film consisted of a series of twoshots in the main where the actors had been supplied with a loose plotline and they were to improvise the dialogue henry jaglon makes the claim that he along with victoria foyt actually wrote the screenplay but the impression was that the actors cognisant of the general direction of the film extemporised the dialogue  and it was not always successful such a case in point was when ron silver made some remark which really didnt flow along the line of the conversation and im not going back to look for it and greta scacchi broke into laughter even though they were supposed to be having a serious conversation because silvers remark was such a non sequitur you get the impression too that one actor deliberately tries to wrong foot the other actor and break hisher concentration another instance of this is when a producer tells silver to bring the  documents times silver looked literally lost for words i have seen one other film which looked like a series of drama workshops on improvisation and that was awful toobr br the fact that jaglon was able to attract greta scacchi no stranger to australia ron silver anouk ami and maximilian schell suggests it was a slow news week for them peter bogdanovich had a whatthehellamidoinghere look on his face at all times and i expected to hear him say look im a director and screenwriter  not an actor  which would have been unnecessary to state faye dunaway seemed more interested in promoting her son liam apart from the jerky delivery of the dialogue the handheld camera became irritating even if it was for verisimilitude  as i suspect the natural dialogue was  and the interest in the principals became subsumed to the interest in the various youths walking along the strand trying to insinuate themselves into shot that at least approached cinema verite so that along with the irritating french singing during which i used the mute button made for a generally disappointing 90odd minutesbr br i think we should avoid apotheosising films such as this trying to see value in the film where it has little credit in order to substantiate a perceived transcendental level to it is misguided there was really nothing avantgarde about it it didnt come across as a work of art and yet it wasnt a documentary either i know it was a mocumentary but the real test is whether it is entertaining i was bored out of my skull it did have one redeeming feature it pronounced cannes correctly so i gave it 310
7,wow i cant believe people consider this a good movie now i have seen much worse but there are much more romanticfunny comedies with john cusackbr br this is a mediocre film at best while the acting wasnt terrible but not great for a romantic comedy there was little passion little romance there were many loose ends that dont show up or are not addressed unfortunately the main characters do come off as complete cowards they dont know themselves well enough to realize that they dont love the people they are engaged to how do we know they arent in love by the utter lack of remorse both characters have for leaving their finances i can think of few things more romantic than the continual escape from commitment that these two showbr br the movie doesnt even end with a wedding scene more than likely both will get cold feet and drop each other like hot potatoes once a commitment is nearing this movie is really about two people who cant commit to anything unlike cusacks previous characters who were more than willing to make a deep commitment loyd in say anything martin in grosse pointe blank etcbr br the greatest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twists turns or anything of interest when the movie ended i felt like they had failed to include a climax to the story which basically fits the whole movie boring no suspense about whether the two will end up together no joy when they do no consequences to their actionsbr br it is sad that people are so blind to the shoddiness of this movie that they simply rebuke any criticism with everyone is too cynical criticism of this movie is not cynicism simply unbiased examination there are many other better romantic comedies even ones with grace kelly or eva marie saintbr br if you think this movie is great try these movies you hearts will explode the princess bride say anything grosse pointe blank high fidelity keeping the faith charade rear window north by northwest or theres something about mary which is a good examination of idealized romance vs todays society
3,i love this movie jouvet arletty blier carn almost everything has already been said about the movie but there is one detail id like to shed some light onto no footage of the real still standing htel du nord is it still i heard it was to be demolished has been used for the movie  the whole scene has been rebuilt on set the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the st martin canal for several weeks
7,i remember seeing this on tv in the late 70s  and it stayed with me its charming loud colourful  a great kids film i put it on for some friends at a party recently  and naturally they thought i was mad and expected something sick to happen to the puppets a la meet the feebles but no  its wholesome clean funbr br jack wild is in fine form as is mama cass and the somehow attractive witchy poobr br if you like the banana splits and you are in your 30s this will recreate that surreal childhood saturday morning vibebr br even if ive realised now that puf himself is a bit crap  as all he does is get captured and run away quality tv movie  if like me you are into death metal  youll love it
6,okay weve got extreme verhoeven violence although not as extreme as other verhoeven flicks weve got plenty of sex and nudity but something is missingoh yes its missing the intelligence that paul verhoeven is known for in his scifi movies i admire the way verhoeven introduces the characters and how they have a sense of humor but unlike most verhoeven films the movie itself doesnt have enough humor for it to fall into the comedy genre the acting overall was above average compared to most slasher filmsbr br what makes hollow man a good movie is not the story not the cast or characters but the amazing special effects work that would otherwise make a film like this impossible the crew has truly made an invisible man without the use of things like a floating hat suspended on piano wires and other practical effects effects done on set the most stunning effects scenes are not seen while kevin bacon is invisible they are when kevin bacon is becoming invisible and visiblebr br the problem is that this invisible man story deserves to be more imaginitive here it takes place at a lab for the most part i would have enjoyed seeing the invisible kevin bacon robbing a bank and getting away with it or lets say steal something from peoples purses or something like that but what is shown is decent enough to make hollow man an entertaining movie grade b
6,its plain to see why the makers of scary movie found it so easy to spoof these teen slasher movies they are so unbelievably formulaic and if valentine had been released a year or so earlier im sure they would have been spoofing this film too  thats if they found any actual original material to distinguish it from the screams i know what you did last summers and urban legendsbr br valentine offers nothing new to this genre except a better than usual ending which of course leaves lots of room for the inevitable sequel as always a masked psychotic killer stalks a bunch of beautiful young women killing the main characters friends one by one in typically over the top style lots of ta on display no character development bad acting and overly elaborate bloodshedbr br the thing i cant stand about these kind of movies is that they pass themselves off as who done its the thing is that they arent because the motive is only revealed once the killer has unmasked and tells the main character whos friends have now all been murdered usually something that was never made at all clear during the film anyway eg main characters mothers uncles fishing partner kicked his friends fathers dog everybody still left alive throughout the film is a suspect but they are more red herrings than suspects as we all know at this point the main character manages an implausible escape and kills the unmasked psycho killer after the motive is revealedbr br valentine followed this formula almost to the letter spoiler mini spoiler anyway in valentine the motive was not revealed but more left for you to think about given that the film didnt quite conclude in the typical teen slash way the issue is only part resolved and the goal of the lead killer may or may not have been fulfilled by surviving the bloodshed and killing almost everybody will the killer want more or were the demons truly vanquishedbr br this still didnt make valentine a good film instead it simply saved it from being as bad as usual which still doesnt count for much to anybody thinking of making another film along these lines please dont originality is so important and its hard to see any originality coming out of this genre
7,what makes for best picture material the oscars have come in for a lot of stick for rewarding overblown spectacles that have aged poorly and ignoring the auteurs who would be deified in decades to come it wasnt because hollywood was against art or creativity the academy awards are the selections made by the industry itself and that is why at least in the classic era they tended to reward the greatest collaborations the most sensational meetings of creative mindsbr br the arthur freed unit at mgm had been bound for oscarwinning glory for several years by this point it was only a matter of time before freed aided by his strongest director vincente minnelli and some the finest musical stars in the business would land a best picture freed had arguably done more to raise the status of the musical than anyone else crafting pictures which wove story and song together without losing the dynamic spectacle of the 30s musicals the point about freed musicals is that the lyrics of the songs unlike those of hammerstein or lerner dont have to tell or even relate to the stories whats important is that the tone of the song and the way it is presented fit into the structure of the filmbr br an american in paris was the first of three freed musicals the other two being singin in the rain and the band wagon which took existing classic numbers out of their original context and made them work in a completely unrelated story the words dont fit the plot but the routines fit the show so when gene kelly sings i got rhythm he hasnt even got a girl yet but the way its done with the french kids joining in is a great bit of characterisation and the upbeat tune and dance gives the movie the little lift it needs at this point an american in paris also uses the rulebreaking allowed in the genre to add little unconventional flights of fancy to tell the story such as the series of dances which accompany the description of leslie carons characterbr br and what better director for this project than minnelli himself a painter and a pianist at this time there wasnt really anyone who had a better feel for technicolor while some directors would saturate each scene in one colour or fill the screen with clashing shades minnellis colour schemes are tightly controlled but never look forced in the opening scenes the tones are fairly muted but not drab and in particular there is an absence of red during oscar levant and georges guetarys meeting in the caf a few more vibrant shades are introduced then during the first musical number by strauss minnelli gradually brings in splashes of red  a table cloth a bunch of roses  until it eventually dominates as if the song has awoken the pictures colour scheme for most of the songs the colours are choreographed as intricately as the people however in some numbers such as tralala he keeps the shades the same and instead opens out the space as the song swells up and the characters become more animatedbr br the achilles heel of an american in paris is its story i personally find the romantic angle particularly unpalatable playing as it does like a last hurrah for the misogynistic love stories that reigned supreme in the 30s the headstrong independent woman gets rejected while the meek delicate girl is harassed into loving the hero even if you dont mind that it is difficult to connect emotionally with the story because it is constantly overshadowed by the songs and dances compare this to singin in the rain which doesnt really have as many great routines or memorable setpieces as an american in paris but it has a winning storyline singin in the rain was overlooked at the 1952 oscars yet it is regarded as a classic of the genre today but i think people sometimes forget that cinema is an allencompassing form of visual entertainment not just a means of telling a story an american in paris is not deep or engaging or tearjerking but like a certain demille picture that won the top award the following year it certainly is a great show
6,all dogs go to heaven is one of the best movies ive ever seen i first saw it when i was like now im 12 and i rented it it makes me think of things and it brings back so many memories those were the days i love the music i love when charlie is arriving in heaven i love the song let me be surprised i love how charlie looks and his voice bert reynolds could only play charlies voice this great i love this movie the 1st one is the best one because its so original and great it really does bring back memories that no one can describe not even me if only i could go back to those days i love the characters if this is the way the memories come back when im 12 imagine how ill feel when im like 19 i hope ill be able to watch this when im older when i first seen this i never knew that i would really look back on it and feel this way  i hope it will be available to watch im so happy that this movie was made and the amazing idea came to mind and heart on a scale from 110 id give it a perfect 10 its an amazing movie its so hard to explain the feeling when i get older and if i have kids i hope they can experience this feeling
0,an updated version of a theme which has been done before while that in and of itself is not bad this movie doesnt reach the ring like the other inherent and pure evil ones do br br predictable ambitious attempt that falls short of the mark not worth sitting through for the tired contrived ending
0,the turgid pace of this movie numbs us to any shocks that it might provide there was no real suspense most of the characters were insipid the chesty irish priest was as lame as the love interest interest is misleading the girl that they chose to provide the films sensuality might be better the central conflict of the main character was uninvolving this film is entirely devoid of positives it is like a tedious exercise by someone who didnt want to go to the gym that day but did anyway
5,intervention has helped me with my own addictions and recovery im a middleaged married father of two im quite functional in my personal and professional life still i have pain from my past that i use addictions to soothe and issues from which i am slowly recovering when these addicts and their families share their lives with me they help me to improve my life and my relationship with my familybr br the show unlike many others digs into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction many of us suffer because its too scary to go back and do as alice miller says the discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of our childhood the show deserves a lot of credit for at least getting this process started this digging is painful and difficult but worth it so much coverage of addiction  fictional and nonfictional  seems to ignore the underlying issues often its assumed that the addict just one day started to shoot up or whatever for fun or pleasure or selfinterest and now they cant stop not so addictions are about killing pain i can relate to the different events and hardships in peoples lives there are common themes and surprising exceptions many addicts have suffered miserable abuse some kids simply respond badly to divorce to those who think that addiction is an overreaction to a hardship i would just say that different people respond differently although some kids handle divorce well others like cristy in the show collapse in a heap on the floor and have their lives forever changed by the eventbr br for example last nights counselor said that pretty young andrea seeks validation from men she strips for cash for a 75year old neighbor and lets men abuse her sound familiar to anyone the series is filled with information that we can use to understand our own motivations and make adjustments to our lives often its those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest as they say even a stopped watch is right twice a day but a slow watch can go undetected for quite a while until its made your life miserablebr br to the producers thank you for making the show for digging into the past for the followups also the graphics the format and the theme music are brilliantbr br to the addicts thank you for your courage to share whether or not you have helped yourself you have helped me
7,saw this movie in an early preview and i cannot stress enough how bad i thought this film was from the very beginning the audience was groaning over pacinos awful southern accent poor al looked really really haggard and i cant decide whether this was purposely part of his role as a drug addicted publicist or perhaps he just didnt get any sleep before coming to the set much worse than pacinos close ups however is the wretched excuse for a plot early in the film we are given indications that pacinos character is gay and i suspect that is what the screenwriter had originally intended later however we are supposed to suspend our incredulity and believe that both tea leoni and kim basinger both of whom are sleepwalking through lame roles lust after this elderly half dead looking effeminate man with the ridiculous accent the worst part overall was the main plot thread which had to do with some corporate espionage that is never fully explained and we never ever care about in the slightest because this was a preview i will reserve my final judgment because of the possibility of reshoots and editing but you can bet i will not pay a cent to see this in theaters
0,being a fan of the first lion king i was definitely looking forward to this movie but i knew there was really no way it could be as good as the original i know that many disney fans are wary of the directtovideo movies as i have mixed feelings of them as wellbr br while watching the lion king 1 i tried to figure out what my own viewpoint was regarding this movie am i going to be so devout about the lion king that i will nitpick at certain scenes or am i just going to accept this movie as just another look at the lion king story most of the time i found myself embracing the latterbr br the lion king 1 definitely has its cute and funny moments timon and pumbaa stole the show in the first movie and definitely deserved a movie that centered around them people just love these characters my favorite parts of the movie include the montage of timon  pumbaa taking care of young simba and the surprise ending featuring some great cameosbr br i could have done without many of the bathroom jokes though like the real reason everyone bowed to baby simba at the beginning of lion king i guess those types of jokes are for the younger set which after all is the target audience i dont think many kids are really concerned about disneys profit margin on directtovideo moviesbr br however i will say that i was somewhat annoyed when they directly tied in scenes from the original movie to this movie im just too familiar with the original that those scenes just stuck out like sore thumbs to me something would be different with the music or the voices that it would just distract mebr br as for the music it wasnt too bad but dont expect any classics to come from this movie at least lk2 had the nice ballad love will find a way as for the voicework it was well done in this movie nathan lane and ernie sabella did a great job as always and even new cast members the classic comedic actor jerry stiller and julie kavner best known as marge simpson did a great job also you can even enjoy these great voice talents even more by checking out the virtual safari on disc of the dvd that feature is definitely a lot of funbr br so all in all the lion king 1 isnt a perfect movie but its cute and entertaining i think many lion king fans will enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is  a fun lighthearted look at the lion king masterpiece from our funny friends perspectivesbr br my imdb rating 710 my yahoo grade b good
7,sasquatch hunters actually wasnt as bad as i thoughtbr br spoilersbr br traveling into the woods park rangers charles landon kevin oconnor roger gordon matt latimore brian stratton david zelina spencer combs rick holland and his sister janet stacey branscombe escort dr helen gilbert amy sheltonwhite her boss dr ethan edwards gary sturm and assistant louise keaton juliana dever to find the site of some reputed bones found in the area when they make camp the team discovers a giant burial ground and more strange bones littering the area when members of the group start to disappear they start to wander through the woods to safety its discovered that a sasquatch is behind the killings and the team band together to survivebr br the good news this wasnt as bad as i thought it would be the movie really starts to pick up some steam at around the halfway point when the creature attacks that is a masterful series of scenes as the whole group is subjected to attacks by the creature and the suspense throughout the entire playout is extremely high the wooded area is most appropriately milked during these parts heightening the tension and wondering when a single person wandering around in the forest will get their comeuppance also spread quite liberally through the movie is the effective use of offscreen growls and roars that are truly unworldly they really do add much to make this part so creepy as well as the other times the growling shriek is heard its quite effective and works well its quite nice that the later part of the film picks up the pace as it goes out pretty well on a high note of action one scene especially i feel must point out as being a special scene on first viewing as a man is running through the forest from the creature he spots the expedition that has gone on looking for it raising his hands to holler to them for help the second he goes to announce his presence is he attacked from out of nowhere and killed quite hastily it caught me by surprise and actually gave me a little jump on first viewingbr br the bad news there was only a couple things to complain about here and one is a usual complaint the creature here is mostly rendered by horrible cgi which made him look totally ridiculous and destroys any credibility it mightve had the air of menace conjured up by the opening of the film is almost shot out the window when the creature appears on screen its so distracting that its a shame a little more work wasnt put into it ive complained about this one a lot and is something that really should be done away with as it doesnt look that realistic and is quite fake another big one is the offscreen kills in here very often in the film is a person grabbed and then yanked away and then finding the bloody body afterward its quite aggravating when the kills look nice and juicy afterward otherwise i dont really have much of a problem with this one as everything else thats usually critiqued about this one didnt really bother me but it is called on for others beyond this stuffbr br the final verdict i kinda liked this one but its still not the best sasquatch movie ever its not supposed to be taken seriously and if viewed that way its actually quoit enjoyable fans of these films should give this one a look and those that like the scifi creature features might find some nice things in here as wellbr br rated r graphic language violence and some graphic carcasses
1,i wasnt quite sure if this was just going to be another one of those idiotic nighttime soap operas that seem to clutter prime time but as it turns out this is a pretty good show no small thanks to talented casting four female friends with diverse backgrounds get together and share the weekly goingson of their lovelives the hour long program follows each of them separately through their often screwed up quests to find love and it does it without being boring or trite sharon smalls trudi is the homemaker one allegedly widowed after september 11th who gets a little preachy and annoying with her friends who tend to be a little looser and more creative in their endeavors its great to see small back on tv as she was great in the inspector lynley mysteries the chick can act orla bradys character siobhan a lawyer is perhaps the most damaged but still very sympathetic of the women as she wrestles with her kind but selfabsorbed husband hari jaffrey formerly of spooks in his driven desire to have a child with her regardless of her needs the final two members of the cast are the effervescent jess shellie conn an events planner whos a wild child who sleeps with anyone and everyone gender not specific and katie sarah parrish a somber doctor whos affair with a patient and his son have sent her career and love life spiraling out of control that being said im hooked now and hope that the bbc continues cranking this series out because its good its different and its got a great cast

1,abhay deols second film written by imtiaz ali maiden directorial effort by shivam nair soha probably has her first  meaty role as megha a girl who has run away from home and is waiting at the delhi marriage registrars office for her boyfriend dheeraj shayan munshi to meet her she waits and waits and finally is spotted as a damsel in distress by ankush abhay deol they spend many days together as he extricates her from one distressing situation after another and finally falls in love with her then the boyfriend returns aage pardey par dekhiye sound familiar this is yet another adaptation of dostoyevskys white nights with a tiny bit of borrowing from le notti bianchi very tiny though  ankush keeps the lovers apart by telling the boyfriend she is dead but this is an earthier and more realistic duh adaptation than the much hyped and overblown saawariya i wonder why no one brought this little gem up when we were all discussing saawariya like crazy a few months agobr br the delhi settings are wonderful  there is the obligatory run through old delhi shots of jama masjid from a roof top connaught circus streets with rickshaws what how the colorful light fixtures in the hotel are enough to tell you this is a seedy joint with rooms for hire by the hour br br the more i see of abhay the more i like this young man in this second film he is quite good as the for hire witness who is given a purpose in life by a beautiful woman soha looks beautiful and when she smiles she fits the role but i found her unconvincing in the more serious moments i am not quite sure that she has it in her to be a great actress or maybe she will blossom late like the brother the music by himesh reshammiya is not that great and in fact the movie falters at the songs they kind of interrupt the narrative and do not sit well with the characters trying to sing them the supporting cast is excellent and i give this white nights adaptation a thumbs up btw  the fact that i love abhay deols cute dimples has nothing to do with my rating
2,well i can once and for all put an end to the question what is the worst movie ever madeever it is flight of fury starring and cowritten by steven seagal sure there are lots of famously bad movies but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriouslybr br it is a romanianmade film that speaks to just how far romania has to go to catch up with bollywood it also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent steven seagal has become this movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry knowing that nothing will make you feel clean againbr br it was released only on video i cant imagine why and i suspect the workers that had to make the dvds had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling
6,i appreciated the photography the textures the colours and often unlike one comment the lighting what was lacking for me was a coherent storylinei found it often disjointed badly edited and at times difficult to follow my version was 110 minutes imdb shows one at 125m possibly the cuts and subtitles didnt help i applaud any films that escape from the hollywood mould but this left me disappointed miss gillain was luminous and the performances were all fine i just wanted a little more dialogue if anyone would like to see another film that has some affinity with this one try hideous kinkywith kate winslet

0,theyre not jawing journalists cary grant and rosalind russell from his girl friday or witty detective william powell and sassy lady myrna loy from thin man but woody allen and scarlett johansson are surprisingly charming as amateur sleuths in scoop their screwball repartee is more postmodern than post depression allens writing filled with ironic self deprecation and plain old new york angst shades of the old wit occur rarely such as when he as sid the great splendini magician responds about his background i was born into the hebrew persuasion but when i got older i converted to narcissism johansson fresh from allens match point as a bad girl here gets to be a relatively good sometimes ditsy journalism student caught in a murder mystery suitable for london a serial killer the plot is a reworking of his recent londonbased thriller match point right down to the upperclass sins and the american tragedyplace in the sun boating accident as a matter of fact allen is reworking manhattan murder mystery and purple rose of cairo to name just a couple of other examples i care not if he reworks i would like the new material to be at least the equal of the originals and alas it is just a reflection of his younger greatnessbr br allen as director and actor cant hide his love for the actress as he couldnt for diane keaton and therefore takes a middling comedy into an appropriate place down the allen canon not great but amusing at times brilliantly satirical about the suspected upperclass murderer sid allen quips id be very surprised if he killed one person this is vintage allen humor while there are barely any bright literary allusions as in most of his film he lards scoop with music from grieg tchaikovsky and strauss to let us know the woodman has not lost his touch of class
2,when i go out to the video store to rent a flick i usually trust imdbs views on a film and until this one had never seen a flick rated 70 or above on the site i did not enjoybr br sidney lumet a legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century really misstepped here by making one of the biggest mistakes a filmmaker can filling a films cast with thoroughly unlikeable characters with no real redeeming qualities whatsoeverbr br i like films with flawed characters but no matter how dark someones personality is we all have a bit of light in there too were all shades of gray with some darker or brighter than others mr lumet crossed this line by filling this movie with totally unsympathetic and almost masochistic pitchblack charactersbr br ethan hawkes hank is a 30something whining immature irresponsible manchild divorced from a marriage with a wife that hates him and a daughter who thinks hes a loser which he very much is his indecisiveness and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him because hes too cowardly to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery plan falling apart and mother getting killed by the time he stands up to his older brother at the end of the film its more pathetic than uplifting ethan hawke plays his character well but isnt given much to work with as he is portrayed as someone with a boot perpetually stamped on their face and he doesnt particularly care that its therebr br speaking of which his characters wife is equally as bad just about every single shot of the film shes in is her verbally berating him for rent and child support money and further grinding in his already nonexistent selfesteem with insults seriously thats just about all the character does her harpylike behavior borders on malevolentbr br albert finney plays their father charles and while mr finney has been a great actor for many decades he spends about 90 of this film with the same mouth open halfgrimace on his face like hes suffering from the worlds worst bout of constipation for someone whos been an actor as long as mr finney you think hed be more apt at emoting even though he doesnt show it much his character is supposedly grief stricken and angerfilled and when he smothers andy at the films conclusion its akin to dr frankenstein putting the monster he helped create out of its own miserybr br marisa tomei isnt given much to do with her character stuck in an unhappy marriage with andy and having an affair with his brother for some unfathomable reason when andys world begins to spiral out of control she logically jumps ship but it really doesnt make her any less selfish or selfserving than any other character in the film but probably the one with the most common sense at leastbr br and finally we come to andy played by the always good philip seymour hoffman is the only reason i rated this film a instead of a his performance of the heroinaddicted embezzling financial executive whos perfect crime of robbing his parents insured jewelry store goes awry is mesmerizing his descent from calm master planner of a flawed scheme to unstable deranged homicidal maniac is believable and tragic hoffmans character ends up being the films chief villain but its hard to root against him given the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother and a father whos selfadmitted poor early parenting led to his sons eventual psychosis and indirect unintentional murder of his motherbr br ultimately this film is really only worth watching for pshs great performance and its family train wreck nature just dont expect there to be any characters worth cheering for because there really arent
5,the haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house good effects work and sound work a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house there are scenes that make you jump and the sinister aspects of what went on at hill house in the past i found interesting there are genuinely creepy moments in the film and i liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets curtains and the house itself jerry goldsmiths score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you what i wish couldve happened is for something a little more intense jan de bont had a pg13 rating to contend with and i think that he held back a little too much poltergeist scared me silly when i saw it many years ago and it still holds up the haunting couldve used a few more scenes of pure terror the ending was for me a little anticlimactic overall i enjoyed it the acting is good and there are moments that make you jump i just wish it scared me more
6,i dont know what it is i find so endearing about this film but the first time i saw it i wanted to see how it ended im not a big fan of paul winfield nor of wardramas but i was truly wondering just how and when winfield would find his child all he knows is that the boy has green eyes truth be told i have not seen this movie in years nor has it been shown on tv in a while but this movie is somewhat of one mans odyssey after the pains of war winfield shows a very sympathetic and heart warming portrayal of a man lost by his memories there is an underlying message in this movie that he is looking for the last shred of human morality in the aftermath of this war and the reality that he does confront why this movie is not yet on dvd or video is a mystery to me
5,the wonderfully urbane ronald coleman is showcased here as in few other of his films he is literally in every scene and this comical movie remains fresh because of him not in spite of him he is handsome witty and very clever here as he remains a step ahead of his wandering lovely wifeplayed perfectly by anna lee the movie is based on a french play and brings all the best qualities of that farce most of the supporting cast is well known at least by face if not nameand are absolutely perfect for this very funny film the fantastic mr coleman is a combination of sean connery and clark gable as he stays a step ahead of the other characters his multitalents can be further appreciated in the classic lost horizon which every film buff must see
0,i had high hopes for troy and i am so bitterly disappointed the film was directed so badly it made my stomach ache the pacing was so slow the dialogue laughable and the film  well apart from a nice fight scene between achilles pitt and hector bana  the rest was shallowbr br and why oh why does hollywood always insist on rewriting stories to fit consumer approval agamemnon didnt die in troy the war lasted 10 years and achilles was killed by paris outside the walls of troy with an arrow to the ankle it annoys me that such a classic story as this is turned into a soapbr br and dont even start me on the lack of chemistry between helen and paris she was the woman the war was fought over and it didnt even look as if the two of them cared a great deal about the other no sparks no emotion no hopebr br i have to say in the films defence brad pitt eric bana and peter o toole acted very well with a bad script but that isnt enough to save this awful movie br br can anybody tell me where the 200 million budget went maybe in all the trees they used for the funeral pyres  where did they get all those treesbr br i am so disappointed it hurts
3,this is te cartoon that should have won instead of country cousin visually welldone and much more entertaining and memorable worth watching just for the music alone although there are elements that undoubtably will bruise the sensibilities of some these days the cartoon has to be given a bit of perspective its over sixty years old and it is after all just a cartoon im disabled and if i were as hypersensitive as the folks who look at things like this cartoon and take umbrage i would have long since curled up in a fetal position and faded away sometimes you need to lighten up put your head back and float caricatures of celebrities in cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost never terribly flattering bing crosby reportedly hated it when he was used on more than one occasion sigh
3,i have given this film an elevated rating of stars as i personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the filmthe road side bar scene in russia in this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line  50 dollarsyou drink and talk but i felt that my polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing russian accent than i could so i declined to take this speaking part on i was slightly starstruck as this was my first film experienceand who knows these lines could have ended up there with lines such as ill be back and quite frankly my dear i dont give a damn had i spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of rancid aluminium as heavy instead of the name of ryszard janikowski br br as time goes on i am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this filmbr br even though i spent a whole day on the set in south wales hotspot barry island no one could tell me what the actual storyline was the caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it things could certainly have been worse if id ended up naked in this most dreadful of filmsbr br stillon the positive sidei got chatting to rhys ifans during one break i had no idea who he was as notting hill was yet to be released and not an inkling that he might be welsh made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit barry island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s it was only when keith allen showed up that i realised i was in a quality production
7,a horror movie is being shot and things arent going well its about a masked killer the director tells off the killer in front of the cast and crew he goes crazy and kills two people hes killed himself and the film is never finished twelve years later a bunch of film students decide to try and finish itbut theres a curse people who try and finish it are killed themselves the students ignore that guess what happens nextbr br the plot is old hat but this isnt badfor what it is a low budget slasher film its wellmade with a young and fairly talented young cast no one is great but no one is terrible either it also avoids the obligatory and needless female nude scenes it moves quickly the gore is nice and bloody and the script doesnt insult your intelligence also molly ringwald is in this having the time of her life playing a bitchy faded actressbr br no great shakes but not bad at all i give it a
7,this is a terrible remake of a marginal but well liked movie from the early 70s i have seen the original at least times the 1997 version is a 20 minute movie crammed into hours or whatever the runtime is cheesy storyline which by the way is completely different than the original the major government involvement was farfetched there is no flow from one scene to the next in the original you could go get a beer or hit the bathroom and still keep up br br it only took a few hours movie time to change the oil pan on the car it takes many times longer than that in real life car guys notice this stuff also the fool or fools that chose to trash a 1968 charger and abuse a 1970 challenger should be shot in the heel with a dull bullet the fact they arent car people is painfully obvious and their passing will not be grieved br br the actors lacked any emotion everything was cut and dried one step above a monotone a barmitzvah is more exciting and energeticbr br last but surely not least the radio dj made the statement that the challenger hit the bulldozers at 180 or 185  that is total garbage can you say aerodynamics or lack thereof hahahaha this movie is a joke dont waste your time watching this one
0,i never really knew who robert wuhl was before seeing this but after seeing it i realized what a funny man he is this hbo special features him teaching american history to new york university film students and the man was just phenomenal he poked fun at almost every key historic event that occurred not just in the us but some other parts of the world this documentarycomedy was a great satire that made me question if what i accept as the infallible true history is really truebr br i enjoyed how mr wuhl managed to mix useful information with great comedy and made learning a lot more exciting i would recommend this to anyone interested in history and is willing to question what hisher beliefs
6,trying to conceive of something as insipid as the sentinel would be pretty difficult the problems are many the result is terrible and loaded with plot holesbr br michael douglas stars as pete garrison a secret service agent who took one for reagan during the attempt on his life years later we find pete assigned to the whitehouse family mainly as a guard for the first lady kim basinger la confidential troubles arise as we see petes close involvement with the first lady and a sudden threat against the president himself david rasche united 93 when pete fails a polygraph test hes singled out as a disgruntled agent by investigator david breckinridge kiefer sutherland 24 tv seriesbr br as the presidential assassination plot unfolds pete finds himself on the run from his own people his only confidant is the first lady and shes reluctant to tell anyone about their affections for one another which is why pete failed the polygraph in the first place but is pete really innocent or is he simply trying to buy time until he can kill the president if he is innocent how can he help prevent the assassination attempt while running from the secret service br br the one big overwhelming problem with this film is that theres no justification for the reason behind the presidential threat isnt that what the movies supposed to be about one would think so but the audience is never let in on why the assassins want to kill the prez hmm someone forget to put that in the script somewhere br br and whats with david breckinridges kiefers new partner jill marin eva longoria carlitas way seems that she was put in the film strictly as a piece of acandy what was her purpose again did she do anything other than look nice in tight pants and a lowcut blousebr br there are so many problems with the basic premise of the sentinel as to be laughable the action is too easily stymied by the what the responses sure to be uttered by those unfortunate enough to watch the movie
7,expectations were somewhat high for me when i went to see this movie after all i thought steve carell could do no wrong coming off of great movies like anchorman the 40 yearold virgin and little miss sunshine boy was i wrongbr br ill start with what is right with this movie at certain points steve carell is allowed to be steve carell there are a handful of moments in the film that made me laugh and its due almost entirely to him being given the wiggleroom to do his thing hes an undoubtedly talented individual and its a shame that he signed on to what turned out to be in my opinion a total trainwreckbr br with that out of the way ill discuss what went horrifyingly wrongbr br the film begins with dan burns a widower with three girls who is being considered for a nationally syndicated advice column he prepares his girls for a family reunion where his extended relatives gather for some time with each otherbr br the family is high atop the list of things that make this an awful movie no family behaves like this its almost as if theyve been transported from pleasantville or leave it to beaver they are a caricature of what we think a family is when were it reaches the point where they become obnoxious and simply frustrating touch football crossword puzzle competitions family bowling and talent shows are not how actual people behave its almost sickeningbr br another big flaw is the woman carell is supposed to be falling for observing her in her first scene with steve carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated what i imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman comes off as mildly retardedbr br it makes me think that this movie is taking place on another planet i left the theater wondering what i just saw after thinking further i dont think it was much
1,yes ill admit it i believed all the hype surrounding this piece of work about the trials and tribulations of people living in mexico city concerning their sexual lives and so i was really expecting to finally see a mexican movie in ages that was both popular and interesting to watch unfortunately the film was utterly disappointing the story presents us with two couples both with very obvious marital problems when a third party comes into the life of each couple their problems reach a pivotal point or absolute absurd the plot then turns into a battle of the sexes the stance taken by each group yes they literally group girls with girls and boys with boys is blatantly stupid and childish i guess the humor was supposed to be there and it all goes from bad to worse the performances range from good miss zavaleta to mediocre mr bichir with serrano doing an acceptable job on his opera prima however the flat circumstances that make up the plot the onedimensional characters the very poor if not stupid perception of what sex represents in a mature relationship etc make the movie fail miserably spyl has had an impressive good reception at the boxoffice believe the hype at your own risk
6,its one of those stereotypical mtv generation dance movies and i do not see where all this its not that bad rubbish is coming from the acting is terrible it follows exactly the same storyline as all the other dancing movies out there its terrible the name should scream dont watch how she move since when can movie titles ignore grammar at least some dance movies had half decent dance scenes these ones dont even deserve a watch i give it a out of 10 just because there is no zero i seriously implore anyone with an iq of over 60 not to watch this and not to waste your money the 1610 should tell it all this movie should not have even be made
4,before sunrise has many remarkable things going on almost too many to fit into one review like this but its suffice to say that its one of the most observant character studies of the nineties maybe even in all of contemporary cinema to be observant not about love persay so much as its about a human connection how does one fall in love at first sight no one does at least thats deep down the consensus that linklater wants to show with his film and yet there is the possibility of as intense a connection of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time linklater here gives us the story of celine and jessie a french girl and an american boy who get off the same train heading to vienna and on the way there start to talking about things at first arbitrary then personal jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather jessie persuades celine to go along with him on a night out on the town in vienna until his plane the next morningbr br before sunrise gives jessie and celine in the midst of the gorgeous vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance and in a sense is about the act of having conversations of what its like to watch people having one leading into another and another here its often about relationships and commitments as jessie and celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential or seemingly so and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities we hear confessions of desires for other loves or what werent really loves of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how youll love your life of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul i loved the bit about the quakers in the church and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism jessie may be more responsible for that last part but whats fascinating about the film is that its never exactly cynical itself just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their livesbr br meanwhile its always great to see ethan hawke and julie delpy in these roles where theyre not incessantly annoying in that 90s generationx mode but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film which isnt a bad one at all but a necessary one one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere the conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala brief encounter only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other where sweet asides are actually acceptable i have to tell you a secret jessie says and then leans in for a kiss hoho or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way i loved the scene with the poet where its very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal or with the palm reader and how the reactions from jessie and celine are that we might share but really are seeing them do it firsthand all the while hawke and delpy embody the roles interestingly we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives as it may lead off into the futurebr br featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness however selfcontained as it may lead into something more whos to say you cant suddenly be attached to someone if only for less than 24 hours and be that much more attached than a married couple this is perhaps linklaters thesis but theres more to it than just that its a very dense film and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly one scene especially which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking on the phone in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the others friend a
1,wow i cant believe i waited so long to see this film i just never got around to watching it the plot has nothing that interests me i know nothing about soccer football i am one of those american fools that has no clue i had never even seen david beckham before this film i chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this film at the time it was released in america enough about me br br truth be told it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of moviemaking heaven what a fun film its full of color and exuberance i had a goofy grin on my face through the whole movie parminder nagra is so sweet and lovable you cant help but root for her no wonder why the american television show er has snatched her up i have a new appreciation for indian culture those people know how to have a good time the wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful br br the only problem i had was deciphering some of the british slang and dialogue through the accents i turned on the english subtitles to make sure i didnt miss anything this is not a criticism of the film im sure audiences worldwide have trouble understanding the constantly changing slang in american films as well br br this is a perfect date film it has a great sports plot like rocky and a strong sense of feminism that is empowering for women i watched it with my wife and sixteen year old niece and we all loved it i highly recommend it
0,one of the better vance films succeeds more on interesting plot and artful direction by none other than michael curtiz this time around a generally hated financier is found dead  shot in the head  in his locked and bolted bedroom on the upper floor philo vance hearing of the situation while about to set off for italy decides to end his vacation and try to solve what he thinks is a murder and what everyone else is considering a suicide william powell is as affable a philo vance as you will find he never seems to press and is always very smooth in what he says and does powell is aided by a host of very talented actors  some firstrate character actors and actresses like mary astor as a niece that hated her uncle ralph morgan as the dead mans secretary paul cavanaugh as a rival dog fancier arthur hohl as a mysterious butler helen vinson as the next door kept blonde and two really good performances by james lee as the chinese cook and portly eugene palette as a wisecracking police detective add into the mix a wonderfully comedic turn by etienne girardot as a public coroner always missing his meal it is this depth of suspects and a story that has many plots twists and turns that make the kennel murder case a fastmoving fun mystery
5,probably the most accurate stephen king adaption yet not surprising since king himself wrote the screenplay the story follows the creed family moving into a beautiful maine house one of the other residents is jud a pleasant old man who knows a few things about the area one is the highway that runs right through their frontyard the other is a path leading to the pet sematary where children for decades have buried the animals killed by the highway soon enough ellie creeds cat church is found dead luckily this happens while the family with the exception of louisthe father is away for thanksgiving jud takes louis to another burial ground beyond the pet sematary where church is to be buried later louis is greetednot so politely by church hes returned appearing to have chewed his way out of the bag he had been buried in maybe he was buried alive maybe not nothing more i can say without ruining the storybr br of all the king adaptions ive seen this would be the most terrifying the characters are real and the situations are normal mary lambert does a great job directing the proceedings suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film due in part to the plot development the scene where gage is killed will stick in your mind forever then of course we have the conclusion easy to determine whats going to happen but lambert pulls off some genuinely scary and sometimes disturbing momentsbr br overall this is a good film and an excellent adaption if you enjoy being scared and dont mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images then pet sematary is just what youre looking for non horror fans will want to avoid this
7,ugh this is a terrible film full of disastrous comic relief no scares and scary leaps in story and plotline the only creepy thing here is the leading ladys hats lugosi was on his downhill slide and it shows i give this a and this aint no fun
6,i dont know who sue kramer the director of this film is but i have a strong suspicion that a she is a lesbian and b she somehow shamed everyone involved in this project to participate to prove they are not homophobicbr br i can imagine everyone thinking my god this is horrible not funny pedestrian totally lame but keeping their mouths shut for fear they will be labeled antigay or they dont get the gay lifestyle this is probably why kramer did not cast gay people to play gay people too anyway its not even worth reviewing the actors are all directed to play every scene completely over the top so there is no sincerity or believability in anything they do its full of clichs and there is nothing about this movie that is the least bit amusing  much less funnybr br i hated it and im not afraid to say so too bad the gutless people who gave kramer the money to make this bomb werent as unbiased in their judgment
0,while leon is cute on snl hes only on for a minute like most snl skitstomovies this one cant fill 90 minutes it has some cute moments the ones youve seen in the trailer but the actors are largely wasted tim meadows does his best but the plot just doesnt have many high points will farrell has a bit part farrell may be the funniest man alive but not in this movie what a shame
2,the first half of this movie is a pure delight novel funny wonderful performances a close knit brother and sister living in manhattan fall for the same woman adult bright witty what more could you ask as a romantic comedy this starts refreshing it heads into unexplored territory and then it falls apartbr br it goes from being a universal adult comedy to a comingofage comingoutofthecloset story that has been done many times before what a disappointment as a people film it begins with such promise why does it need to turn into such a pedestrian i am who i am film the freezeframe ending shot of heather grahams jumping in the air to celebrate her happiness at finding herself underlines the banality of the last part of the filmbr br it could have been different it could have been magical it ended up being the same old same old
6,after reading only two of the comments herein as a lifelong bronte fan beginning with oliviers heathcliff and enduring with the many versions of charlottes rochester it is more than eyeopening to see that it is the unsung bronte sister who gave the lie to the malechauvinist period the trio inhabited of course the miracle in all three versions of 19thcentury british domesticity is that the girls were all spinsters and their only realistic brushes with men were their vicar father and their wastrel brother that said finally it is anne bronte who has in her single assay proved the feminist point way way ahead of contemporary types and including the voting franchise ranks however history evinces more than a few who preceded including the greek heterai and sappho and the likes of an ancient emperors yang kueifei and how about eve and her apple
0,ok so the musical pieces were poorly written and generally poorly sung though walken and marner particularly walken sounded pretty good and so they shattered the fourth wall at the end by having the king and his nobles sing about the battle with the ogre and praise the efforts of puss in boots when they by rights shouldnt have even known about itbr br who cares its christopher freakin walken doing a movie based on a fairy tale and he sings and dances his acting style fits the role very well as the devious mischievous puss who seems to get his master into deeper and deeper trouble but in fact has a plan hes thought about seven or eight moves in advance and if youve ever seen walken in any of his villainous roles you know the ogre bit the dust hard at the end when walken got him into his trapbr br a fun film and a mustsee for anyone who enjoys the unique style of christopher walken
2,this is one of my all time favorite movies and i would recommend it to anyone on my list of favorite movies mental list mind the only ones on par with it are movies such as the lord of the rings series spirited away and fly away homebr br i can really relate to the main character jess at the start of the movie shes a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls she really sucks you into her life i also certainly cant fault any of the protagonists acting or anyone elses in the filmbr br the soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules the movie is never boring the romance is really cute and didnt make me blush tooooo hard one thing that really made it though was the indian factor jess parents are indian and there are many colourful indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else the indian people are also hilarious essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for itbr br feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film theyre funny theyre refreshing and they make you feel good
0,this film is mediocre at best angie harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers her bitchy demeanor from law and order carries over in a failed attempt at comedy charlie sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anticomedy the only positive thing to come out of this mess is charlie and denises marriage hopefully that effort produces better results
0,i grew up watching full house as a child i stopped watching it for years but about two weeks ago i started back watching it again now my kids watch the show and they love to watch it as well my kids cant believe that dj  on the show and i are the same agebr br i really love the show because it is a show you can watch with your family it has good teachings your kids can learn from also there isnt any drugs and violence on it also when the kids on the show have a problem they can always open up to their family for help thats the message kids should be getting from tv now a days turn to your family for help not to drugs kids should be watching more shows like full house instead of half the mess on tv now a daysbr br i also love the show because it makes you laugh and it is down to earth it talks about real life problems and family matters there is always a lesson you can learn from the showbr br i vote the show a 10
1,when i first started watching this movie i was looking for some kind of subtle metaphors but it soon dawned on me that this movie was indeed about people on a train the interactions between people are like those you can see any day on the street and when in occasion there is a slightly more interesting situation the dialogue becomes stilted and boring its not that i dont get how this film is trying to portray the way people interact its just that in this film they are very boring if you want to see and analyse these kinds of relationships youd be best to actually go out and buy a train ticket and look at the people on the train with you it is realistic but you wouldnt go to a movie to watch a film about you sitting there watching the movie
0,steve martin should quit trying to do remakes of classic comedy he absolutely does not fit this part like the woeful remake of the out of towners this movie falls flat on its face how anybody ever thought steve martin could even come close to jack lemmons wonderful performance is beyond me and the same is true for this movie dan ackroyd could have played the bilko part better martin is great when doing his own original characters but fails miserably trying to recreate other peoples classic work its a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is contained in the first line of the credits when the movie is over the line the producers gratefully acknowledge the total lack of cooperation by the united states army was just about the only line that actually made me laugh if you want to see the real bilko get hold of the original episodes of the phil silvers show those are guaranteed to make you laugh unlike this mistake that should never have happened i put this movie in the same category as the aforementioned lemmon classic and the remake of psycho none of them should ever have happened
5,honestly barbra i know its you whos klicking all those nos on my review 22 times how many people did you have to instruct to help you out here dont you have anything better to do like look at yourself in the mirror all daybr br steven spielberg told barbra that this was the best movie ive seen since citizen kane that pretty much says it all  and serves as a dire warningbr br what are the ingredients for a surefire cinematic disaster and one that will haunt you never letting you forget the tears of both laughter and pain the ingredients barbra streisands face a musical feminism barbra streisands voice barbra streisand directing and an ultracornyidiotic premisebr br hollywood is full of egomaniacs this much we know in fact nearly everyone  by definition  has to be an egomaniac in hollywood why would anyone want to act for the art well if youre dumb enough to believe what they tell you in their carefully prepared interviews and streisand has the biggest ego of them all this is quite an achievement to be surrounded by narcissistic cretins and yet to manage to top them all  remarkablebr br the movie like all her solo endeavors is an ego trip straight out of hell every scene streisand is in is automatically ruined stillborn but as it that werent enough she sings a whole bunch of streisandy songs  you know the kind that enabled the mariah careys the celine dions and the whitney hustons of this world to poison our precious airwaves for decades now just for that she deserves not one but 100 south park episodes mocking herbr br the premise streisand dressing up as a man to study to become a rabbi sounds like a zany zaz comedy apart from it being a clich the obvious problem is that streisand doesnt look like a woman nor does she look like a man  in fact im not even sure shes human the way she looks in this movie well it cannot be described in words et looks like a highschool jock by comparison she looks more alien than michael jackson in the year 2015 she looks horriblebr br the songs they made me shiver particularly papa can you hear me squeel like a demented female walrus in heat and tomorrow night ill prepare the sequel yentl the return of the bitchbr br did you know that streisand considered having a nosejob early on in her career but changed her mind when they told her her voice might change can you believe that she should have done it killing two flies with one swipe thats what it would have beenbr br if youre interested in reading my biographies of barbra streisand and other hollywood intellectuals contact me by emailbr br should barbra streisand finally go into retirement click yes or no
0,so angela has grown up and gotten therapy and an operation to turn her into a real life daughter rather than the son that she was born and now holds a job as  wait for it  a camp counselor how appropriate right i know i love it anyway the first sequel to the sleepaway camp franchise obeys all the rules of horror sequels  more blood more imaginative killings which arent imaginative but still more so than the original more nudity a more elaborate plot and generally worse than the original br br it is entertaining in the same way as the original was in that the characters and wardrobes are so goofy and so authentically 80s that you cant help getting a good laugh at one point a guy asks angela out and she says ill call you and then quickly walks away the guy says to himself how is she gonna call me i dont have a phone and then he sniffs his armpits wondering what turned her off its the hair dudebr br it is a wellknown fact that in 80s slasher movies the murdered teenagers were more often than not being punished by their killer for some kind of bad behavior usually for being too promiscuous when i first started getting into horror movies and saw the friday the 13th movies for the first time in the mid 90s i didnt realize this i learned it in a film class a year or two later and was amazed that their was some method to the madness i was pretty impressed not only that the movies were passing on some kind of message albeit a morbid one but that there was actually some thought put into itbr br but not in this movie at one point just before angela kills one of her victims she says let this be a lesson to you say no to drugs real subtle screen writing there guys then again the dialogue is the most entertaining thing in the movie angela who by the way went through all that therapy and those operations and all that trouble to clean up her past and reinvent herself as a normal and welldeveloped person and then changed her name from angela to umm angela says at one point i dont like being the wicked witch of the west but i know what happens when things get out of control people start getting killedby me habr br then later she demands that one of the counselors mare make an apology to which the girl replies id rather die sorry mare but you really walked into that onebr br two years ago i was a camp counselor at a sleepaway camp similar to the one portrayed in this movie except the camp that i taught at had more than three kids to the 15 or 20 counselors and it also had rules which the one in the movie doesnt this made me notice the myriad of discrepancies in the movie from what camp life is really like br br thats okay though you can hardly make a movie like this with a lot of year olds running around although there were some 10 or 11 year old kids killed in this movie i hadnt seen that kind of thing much before br br definitely bad taste even for a cheesy 80s slasher movie
2,probably the finest fantasy film ever made sumptuous colour spectacular sets incredible spoton miklos rosza musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood acting is superb as well in what could have been stiff and pretentious in lesser hands but here the poetic dialog is deftly sensitively spoken the humour is subtle and delightful as wellbr br doubtless spielberg and lucas were enthralled by this one along with the four feathers 1939 one of the two finest motion pictures released by alexander korda and london filmsand one of the finest motion pictures ever madebr br a true compelling classic
0,i saw this when it first came to video my little sister got it as a gift and i was probably 12 at the time what stood out for me was the lack of midmovie conflict that so many movies have where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just dont say the one thing that youre shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say this is what i like the most about the movie i guess that the main characters dont do mean things to each other halfway through they dont break up and make up they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes onbr br these two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track theyre not that different loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family and cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone anyway i saw this movie posted on hulu and had to watch it again sure theres plot holes if you analyze the script and no woog and dweeb shouldnt be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in realitybr br now what detracts from the film is its unexpected scariness little kids under the age of would probably be frightened by the scenes with dr screweyes and the addition of him halfway through the movie though its blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance is too abrupt there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie perhaps to show that its not that scary without the the dinosaurs i guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second halfbr br considering the target audience who im sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues i think ill give it a pass on those factors too and just enjoy the story its a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every 10 years i think
1,almost 30 years later i recall this original pbs film as almost unbearably tender periodically i check here at imdb hoping that someone has had the good sense to purchase the rights and put it on a dvd its september of 2004 and i keep hoping  deep sighbr br one of the two lead actors went on to a small career primarily in a primetime evening soap the other frances lee mccain was seen in small roles here and there for a few years but nothing they did before or after ever matched this little movie which was produced as i recall it on a shortlived pbs series which showcased original screenplays by new and upandcoming playwrightsbr br i watched it every time it was shown on pbs maybe or times that was before the era of vcrs so i have no record of it except in my minds eyebr br 12312006 addition to above happy new year ladies this wonderful film is finally available on dvd at ladyslipperorg my understanding is that the dvds are burned from the writers own personal copy

1,full house is a great show i am still today growing up on it i started watching it when i was and now i am 12 and still watching it i fell in love with all of the characters especially stephanie she is my favorite she had such a sense of humor in case there are people on this sight that hardly watch the show you should because you will get hooked on it i became hooked on it after the first show i saw which just happened to be the first episode in 2002 it really is a good show i really think that this show should go down to many generations in families and its great too because it is an appropriate show for all ages and for all parents it teaches kids lessons on how to go on with their life nothing terrible happens like violence or swearing it is just a really great sitcom i give it out of stars what do you think oh and the best time to watch it is when you are home sick from school or even the old office it will make you feel a lot better trust me i am hardly home sick but i still know that it will make you feel better and to everybody that thinks the show is stupid well thats too bad for you because you wont get as far in life even if you are happy with your life you really should watch it and you will get hooked on it i am just telling you what happened to me and everybody else that started watching this awesome show well i need must go to have some lunch remember you must start watching full house and soon

6,this film was choppy incoherent and contrived it was also an extremely meanspirited portrayal of women i rented it because it was listed as a comedy thats a stretch and because the cover said andie mcdowell was acting up a storm in it she wasnt im a gal i watched this film with two guys and we spent an hour afterwards exclaiming over how bad it wasbr br warning plot summary below rampant spoilersbr br the movie starts out with a fairly hackneyed plot about an older woman who takes up with a younger man to the severe disapproval of her two jealous single girlfriends they want her to marry a boring guy their own age who is kind of in love with her but shes so happy with her oversexed puppy that youre rooting for them to stick it out and sure enough she decides to marry the guy but her harpy girlfriend aided by the wishywashy one sets up a plot to trick our heroine into thinking the guy is cheating on her it works she has a fight with him he runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck remember the movies title so now hes dead twothirds of the way through the film and although our heroine is a school headmistress who spends her time watching over girls she apparently forgot to use birth control and is pregnantbr br shes already broken off relations with her girlfriends because they were so unsupportive alone and pitiful she decides to marry the boring guy did i mention that the boring guy who kind of loves her is a minister she had asked him to marry her to the young guy nice huh but now she tells him shell marry him and apparently he has no objections to being dicked around in this fashion but her girlfriends rescue her at the altar and take her home where they notquiteconfess that they were mostly responsible for the love of her life getting smushed she has the kid in the final scene they leave it in a crib inside her house while they go out on the porch to drink smoke and be smug i kid you not its that bad i left out the part about the cancer redherring and the harpys ridiculous lesbian moment
0,pleasant story of the community of pimlico in london who after an unexploded ww2 bomb explodes find a royal charter stating that the area they live in forms part of burgundybr br this movie works because it appeals to the fantasy a lot of us have about making up our own rules and not having to listen to them a solid cast of british stalwarts especially stanley holloway makes this more believablebr br there are some very nice moments in the film such as when the people have ran out of supplies and other londoners on the other side of the barricade start throwing food and other things over to thembr br even though you always knew pimlico would become part of the uk again the people of pimlico and as a consequence the viewer doesnt mind when this happens leaving a nice happy feelingbr br its amazing to think that these low budget movies from a small studio in london still remain so popular over fifty years later the producers must have got something right
0,an italianamerican coproduction costarring linda blair and david the hoff hasselhoff how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treatbr br well based on the uneventful extremely tedious and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so i would have said very easily thankfully however things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy a smattering of nudity too unfortunately my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive materialbr br the hoff stars as gary a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend leslie leslie cumming to a rundown hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project a book about witches whilst there frustrated gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving leslie of her virginitybr br his plans for nookie are scuppered however by the unexpected arrival of property developers freddie and rose brooks robert champagne and annie ross their pregnant daughter jane blair son tommy michael manchester pretty nymphomaniac architect linda sullivan catherine hickland and estate agent jerry rick farnsworth who have come to inspect the islands hotelbr br after explaining their unexpected presence on the island gary and leslie are welcomed by the propertys new owners and when a violent storm suddenly picks up making it perilous to return to the mainland everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building unfortunately unbeknownst to the hotels new guests the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch hildegard knef who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life one by one victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs before meeting a terrible fatebr br none of this makes much sense and the acting is atrocious manchester as tommy is particularly bad whilst hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers which speaks volumes about the others but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore rose has her lips sewn together before being roasted alive in a fireplace jerry is crucified and burnt alive linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish freddies veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood and gary gets stabbed in the backbr br oh and leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and blair gets possessed again

3,i was excited when i heard they were finally making this horrific event into a movie the whole era 1980s southern california and subject matter drug and porn industry is intriguing to me i thought this would be a sure fire hit i was not thrilled with the choice of kilmer as holmes they do not resemble each other in physical appearance or mannerisms i guess he sells tickets however i was willing to overlook this and give it a fair shot i was a bit shocked that there were only like four other people in the entire theater with me on that first day of showing now the whole crime and story in the film is hard to do i will admit that there were no witnesses to this very violent and brutal act john holmes was there but he was also a pathological liar and worried about what would happen to his family and self if he talked to police about it in fact holmes never really testified about what happened and the crime did go unsolved so this was still really one big mystery a mystery that this movie does nothing to cast light on the person writing the screenplay had a whole lot of discretion and most of the principal characters are dead however there is no real storyline it is fragmented claptrap the script is light and the actors try to hard to beef up paper thin lines by overacting the film gives no insight into holmes or the other people involved kilmers character disappears for long stretches his girlfriend is dull the police are jokes even kudrow tries hard to make a flimsy role look substantial it is a very shallow piece and dare i say boring the director even tries to turn it into a love story which is nice unless you know anything about what a piece of trash john holmes really was perhaps a couple of viewings of andersons boogie nights might have helped here boogie nights was innovative and exciting in all regards this film on the other hand was flat and without any real charm or style even the music is out of place with duran duran being played in a scene that was supposed to have taken place in 1980 then we have gordon lightfoot gordon lightfoot there could have been a great film based on this gruesome event but i have not seen it yet i have not seen even a decent one yet unless you consider the rahad jackson scene from boogie nights
7,i considered myself to be quite melancholy especially when i watch a great touching and tearjerking movies but not for this one which surprised me and it is also really surprising me to see how many people praised this movie so highlybr br there are several disturbing facts throughout the movies despite guiltridden bens real intention to save lives to redeem his past i find it disturbing that the film seems encourage this type of suicidal action some people may perceive this is a heroic action and some others think he behaves cowardly in the end this was a disturbing action to mebr br the movie story line is overdramatized but the logic is oversimplified medically blood type match is required to be an organ donor toward the end of the film we learnt that emily had rear blood type that limited her chance to get the donor within short time period nevertheless it seemed that ben had the rare blood type same as hers which allowed him to be her donor and conveniently despite the rarity of bens blood type he was able to donate not only his heart but also his kidney his cornea and his bone marrow which in all cases require not only matching blood type but also tissue antigenbr br why the doctors allow bens organs being donated despite the jellyfish venom he used to kill himselfbr br i might be overanalyzing the whole story as after all this is just a movie however some disturbing facts outlined above hopefully will help you reconsider your plan to go to watch this movie if you go for a soapopera type of film go for it but it you go seeking for an intelligent entertainment give this one a miss

0,with the exception of family this new season is worse than season one i cant imagine what they are thinking as a fan of horror can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless mayhem but this series gets worse with each outing i cant imagine how disheartening it must be for the actors and crew to go to work each day toiling to churn out such crap story is that too much to ask for character how can we give damn about the fate of anyone in these stories if we are not engaged who cares if they get carved up or whatever almost every episode ends with mindless blood letting going for gross out shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion or reason why we have been subjected to an hour of bloodletting even dantes effort this season had some disturbing sexist violence and wandered off to a pointless conclusion ironically the production values and performances tend to be up to speed while the content is utter crap i have great hopes for exec producers garriss valarie under the stairs but we shall see

1,william h macy is at his most sympathetic and compelling here as a hitman and loving father who wants to step out of the family business without angering his overbearing parents treads much of the same territory as tvs the sopranos in terms of the midlife crisis of a criminal theme here too he visits a shrink but is still worth watching thanks to some taut direction from brommel i look forward to what this guy directs next an excellent script and all around great performances macy is excellent as always this is probably his best role since fargo donald sutherland is at his creepy best as the domineering father tracy ullman gives a surprisingly riveting dramatic turn as macys wife young david dorfman is excellent as macys bright and sensitive son many of his lines sound adlibbed and are wonderful even neve campell who i usually find abhorrent is compelling as the troubled young woman who captures macys eye all of this is punctuated by a moving score and crisp pace that lead up to a predictable but still powerful climax and meaningful and touching aftermath this film deserved a much wider release as i suspect it would have connected with audiences
5,i grew up on the superman ii theatrical version s2t and as a kid i loved it more than part i since not only did it contain more superman and three supermantype villains it started off with a bang  the best clark kent to superman transformations and rescue scenes kids no longer had to impatiently wait for superman to appear on screen as in part i now as an adult i can see how the mighty had fallen with s2t see my review ive always heard of the backstory on how they prematurely and unjustifiably fired the originals director richard donner from part ii it must have been a rarity back then to film two separate movies simultaneously now its common back to the future and matrix  for example unfortunately after finally seeing the richard donner cut or s2rd i still cant fully recommend it gone was the great superman change scene the entire paris rescue as was the wonderful recap of part i in s2ts opening in fact they all but wrote the words previously on superman in s2rd the special effects werent great in either part i or s2t  but s2rd they were mostly downright laughable  such as lois falling from the daily planet window i will admit some new scenes worked and some they took out were welcomed departures such as any scene in the honeymoon suite overall if you grew up on s2t as i did and loved it as a child  not nitpicking as i do as an adult you should absolutely see s2rd as its almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes spoiler alert unfortunately the worst change comes last gone was also the weird amnesia kiss from s2t replaced with the exact same ending as i this is not only a lazy unoriginal copout it doesnt make sense on why clark would go back to that diner if those events never actually happened and will he continue to turn back time for every confrontation

3,witchery might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80s but luckily enough it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices honestly the screenplay doesnt make one iota of sense but who cares when linda blair with an exploded hairstyle portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and david hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer who cant seem to get laid in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo sewnshut lips upside down crucifixions vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of massachusetts the young couple is there to investigate the places dark history the dysfunctional family with a pregnant linda blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are considers reopening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex theyre forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady  an aging actress or something who always dresses in black  starts taking them out in various engrossing ways everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window anyway the plot is definitely of minor importance in an italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spinoff of the evil dead the atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the makeup effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film theres something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried
5,for years i remember reading about this show trouble with tracy in the tv guide cftotv toronto every saturday morning at am i lived about a twohour drive north of toronto and we couldnt get cfto but you know how it is  we always want what we cant havebr br well i knew what i wanted and what i wanted was to see what this trouble with tracy was all about did it have a beautiful girl in the starring role was there nudity was there suspense was it a comedy it wouldve been fine if there was some promotion of the show at least i couldve known what i was missing but no the mystery drove me bonkers until ctv affiliate ckco built a retransmitter in wiarton ontario and began to broadcast trouble with tracy at the same time as cftosaturday mornings at am one saturday morning i got up and turned the tv on at 559 and at last i got to see what the trouble with tracy was yes the trouble with tracy was that it was canadian content and stuck in the harmless am spot so no one would ever see how awful it wasbr br talented canadian actor steve weston died a few years afterward but many would argue he effectively died the first time he appeared on this show when i saw it for the first time that cold saturday morning and fell despondent back into my bed part of me died too
2,the movie aimed at adults is a rare thing these days but moonstruck does it well and is still a better than average movie which is aging very well although its comic moments aim lower than the rest of it the movie has a wonderful specificity italians in brooklyn that isnt used to shortchange the characters or the viewers ie mobsters never appear in acomplication it never becomes grotesque like my big fat greek wedding the secondary story lines are economically told with short scenes that allow a break from the major thread these are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary movies where their immediate value cannot be impressed upon producers and bigwigs i miss these scenes it also beautifully involves older characters the movie takes its own slight quiet path to a conclusion there isnt a poorly written scene included anywhere to make some executives sphincter relax cage and cher do very nice workbr br moonstruck invokes oldschool ethnic workaday new york much like marty except moonstruck is way less sanctimonious
6,i had some reservations about this movie i figured it would be the usual bill of fare  a formula movie about christmas being in the middle of a heat wave in late june we decided to give it a shot anyway maybe we would see some snowbr br this movie turned out to be one laugh after another ben affleck was believable in his character but the real star of this one is james gandofini he delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great dadbr br if you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours definitely check this one out
5,emma is a horribly flawed film based on jane austens classic novel i have not read the book so i really didnt know that much about the plot and yet i still predicted nearly the entire plot there were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing the film is though for some reason very entertaining and i loved it of course there were all the scenes i disliked but the majority was well acted and funny gwyneth paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in emma the film also stars toni collettewho has okay but has been much better ewan mecgregerwho has also been better but he is still very good here alan cummingwho i have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here and jeremy northamwhos performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle even if that was not what it needed there have been much better adaptations of jane austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching
1,i expected a bad movie and got a bad movie but i couldnt really imagine in my worst fantasy how bad this movie was i dont even want to try to explain what blood surf is about is not about blood surfing but a big a crocodile they are complaining about the fake shark in jaws but spielberg was wise and didnt show the shark until the end here the crocodile is shown a lot of times and its the worst fake crocodile i have ever seen and they dont try to hide it if you want to see a good fake crocodile watch lake placid br br the director had an opportunity to make a decent surfshark movie but he had to make a bad bmonster movie he had the chance to make an original surf movie but he wanted to make a monster movie so you have understand how bad this movie is does it have some good parts not really it got some nudity and a sex scene that is taken straight out of a playboy movie the acting isnt half bad either and kate fischer looks good too bad she doesnt take her top off the lead actors arent bad either they had some potential the location was beautiful and the movie start good with some nice surf scenes the blame is on the untalented writer and director the dialogue is some of the worst i have ever seen and the script is really badly written and the director got no talent what so ever and not much of a fantasy eitherbr br dont watch it even if you want to watch the beautiful kate fischer it isnt worth it watch sirens to watch kate nude and watch lake placid if you want some good crocodile actionbr br 310 because im in a good mood and maureen larrazabal looks good naked and kate looks good but is bad actressand dex miller joel west and matt borlenghi did a good job with the piece of sht they had to work with
3,besides the fact that my list of favorite movie makers is 1stanley kubrick 2god allmighty 3the rest this movie actually is better than the book and the tv miniseries though this is an easy feat considering the director the flawless filming stile the acting and kubricks all time number one skill the music  make it the masterpiece of horror i watched the tv miniseries a few years ago and liked the story and i had my hopes about this when i got a hold of it it blew me away it is far better than i ever imagined it it starts slow kubrick trademark and has a lot of downtime that builds up the suspense the intro scene is a classic by all means and i watched it about 20 times just for the shear atmosphere it induces to the whole film also the film doesnt offer a lot of gore it has just enough and it is by no means tasteless a trend that i hate in recent day horror films just watch it
6,when i really began to be interested in movies at the age of eleven i had a big list of must see films and i would go to blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend some of them were not for all audiences and my mother would go nuts i remember one of the films on that list was a chorus line and could never get it so now to see it is a dream come truebr br of course i lost the list and i would do anything to get it back because i think there were some really interesting things to watch there i mean take a chorus line a stage play turned into film i know its something we see a lot nowadays but back then it was a little different apparently and this film has something specialbr br most of the musicals made movies today take the chance the camera gives them for free to create different sceneries and take the characters to different places a chorus line was born on a theater stage as a play and it dies in the same place as a movie following a big audition held by recognized choreographer zach michael douglas richard atenborough directs a big number of dancers as they try to get the jobbr br everything happens on the same day the tension of not knowing the stress of having to learn the numbers the silent competition between the dancersand it all occurs on the stage where douglas puts each dancer on the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experiences there are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic but they list shortens as the hours go bybr br like a movie i saw recently a prairie home companion the broadcast of a radio show atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity on or behind the stage things are going on and time doesnt seem to stop again i dont if atenborough cut a lot to shoot this but it sure doesnt look like it and anyway its a great directing and editing john bloom work but in that little stage what you wonder is what to do with the camerawith only one setting ronnie taylors cinematography finds the way making closeups to certain characters zooming in and out showing the stage from different perspective and also giving us a beautiful view of new yorkbr br in one crucial moment douglas tells the ones that are left before we start eliminating youre all terrific and id like to hire you all but i cant this made me think about reality shows today where the only thing that counts is the singing or dancing talent and where the jury always says that exact words to the contestants before some of them are leaving even when they are not good its hard you must imagine at least here where all of them really are terrificbr br to tell some of the stories the characters use songs and in one second the stage takes a new life and it literally is a dream come true the music by marvin hamlisch and the lyrics by edward kleban make the theater to film transition without flaws showing these dancers feelings and letting them do those wonderful choreographies by michael bennett the book in the theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay by arnold schulman which is very touching at times so if its not with a song it will be with a word but in a chorus line its impossible not to be movedbr br during one of the rehearsal breaks in the audition cassie a special dancer played by alyson reed takes the stage to convince douglas character that she can do it the words let me dance for you never sounded more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyrics
1,cinematographycompared to the wrestler a degree of verite and cinematic skill that disarms the viewer and then hypnotizes as wellbr br actingthe dialogue is minimal but the pauses and silence poignantbr br storythe conflict in a balkanized denmark is volatile as we saw recently jihad murders in the netherlands and riots in france while i harbor no love for islam the departure from the west from christian values holds no cause for celebrationbr br the director of this film managed to mirror the two societies in a way that belabored neither emphasizing the development of aicha as an individual who became a champion not so much in the ring but to all those around her even her worst    i will stop here to avoid the spoiler
5,need i sayits a stinker i gave it a rating of 2br br only watch it if you suffer from insomniabr br theres plenty of scenery chewing and hamming it up but not much else happens in this movie there is no suspense no deep shocking secrets revealed no real threat to the heroines well being a few disagreements slight raising of voicesthats pretty much it the secrets are nothing that couldnt happen to anybody  the last secret revealed in the film is totally predictable by that pointbr br the plot such as it is revolves around a young woman named faith meg tilly who is an artist who is hired to paint a series of mural panels in a huge ballroom in a vast mansion by a very very wealthy older widowed woman and a growing motherdaughter type relationship that the older woman craves with herbr br it turns out the older womans daughter cassandra is dead you can pretty well fit the rest of the pieces togetherbr br even the scene with the mysterious man menacing our heroine does not advance to the point where you really fear for her safety beyond maybe a second or two why hes still hanging around years after cassandras death is a good questionbr br theres also the question of the fact that in this vast mansion there is only one servant a faithful butler who seems to do everythingcooking cleaning serving the meal answering the door etc everything except apparently locking the doorsince that would be the only explanation for how one of the characters just walks into a room where faith isbr br theres nothing that will have you grasping your chair arms and leaning forward on the edge of your seat because there is no mounting tension in this filmjust bland pathetic revelations that get tossed out from time to timebr br 
6,many of the lead characters in hideo goshas 1969 film hitokiri manslayer aka tenchu  heavens punishment were actual historical figures in western nameorder format ryoma sakamoto hampeita takechi shimbei tanaka izo okada ____ anenokoji the name hitokiri a historical term refers to a group of four superswordsmen who carried out numerous assassinations of key figures in the ruling tokugawa shogunate in the mid1800s under the orders of takechi the leader of the loyalist ie ultranationalist proemperor faction of the tosa clan what was this struggle about sad to say you wont find out in this film brilliant history lesson indeedbr br no gosha is much more interested in showing you the usual bloody slicing and dicing and at absurd length the inner torment of the notverybright killer izo okada than in revealing actual history sakamoto for example was someone of historical significance considered to be the father of the imperial japanese navy the closest gosha comes to providing a history lesson is the scene in which sakamoto whom takechi considers a traitor to the loyalist cause comes to takechis mansion to try to sway him ideologically he begins by talking about the international political situation with foreign warships in japans ports and a japan that is too weak militarily to defend against them want to know more sorry gosha cuts off this potentially fascinating lecture in mid sentence so much for informing his audience about a turning point in japanese historybr br the film left me in utter confusion about the aims of the two sides in this struggle for the two and a half centuries that the shogunate held central power in japan it was an institution dedicated to preventing social change to preserving the feudal relations of society it was fearful of outside contamination both ideological and technological in keeping with this spirit it outlawed firearms those instruments of leveling in europe and the americas with which a peasant could have stood up to a samurai throughout this period the emperor was nothing more than a spiritual figureheadbr br but in the towns which stood in neutral zones between the feudal fiefdoms a new class of merchants landlords and craftsmen was developing  the class known in europe by its french name the bourgeoisie inevitably as this new class gained strength it chafed against the many confines of feudal society as in europe the king emperor became the central figure in the bourgeoisies struggle for power against the feudal aristocracy but a political leadership does not always fully understand the interests of the class it serves when the outside world arrived with a bang in 1853 in the form of us admiral perrys black ships the ruling elite of japan was thrown into a crisis their military was no match for these foreigners also they had heard about the havoc the british and french imperialists were wreaking in china what should japan do to save itself from the fate of its weak neighbor surprisingly some elements within the usually isolationist shogunate were inclined to open trade with the foreigners in order to obtain some of their advanced technology this is the point of view represented just barely in the film by sakamoto on the other hand the emperorloyal ultranationalists represented by takechi believed they could keep out the foreigners by force if only they could prevent the other faction from selling out the country sound familiar thus the assassination of key shogunate figures is in order  and away we gobr br takechis motivations were for me the films biggest puzzle gosha suggests that he is fighting mainly for his personal advancement rather than for the loyalist cause can we take this to represent the tenor of the loyalists as a whole do you carebr br several reviewers have compared this film favorably with goyokin which gosha made in the same year but where goyokin is a crackling suspenseful adventure yarn with a hero worthy of sympathy hitokiri is plodding nowhere near as compelling and lacks such a hero sakamoto could have been this films hero but we are not allowed to know him  nor what he stands for  well enough for him to achieve that statusbr br in view of his wonderful scores for five previous kurosawa films masaru satos score here was very disappointing sounding like something rejected from a bonanza episodebr br barry freed
0,a friend of mine lent this video to me and i was fairly excited to watch it but after ten minutes of james hetfields slow pitched vocals and lars banging on his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion i began to think why am i watching this that question will be coursing through your minds in  10 minutes after you hit play i gave the tape back the same day as you would suspect not worth buying or watchingbr br just my opinionbr br 
7,this movie shows life in northern cameroon from the perspective of a young french girl france dalens whose father is an official for the colonial french government and whose family is one of the few white families around it gives a sense of what life was like both for the colonists and for the natives with whom they associated its a sense consistent with another movie ive seen about africa in a similar time period nirgendwo in afrika 2001 but i have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is its not just an impression  things do happen in the movie  but the plot is understated the viewer is left to draw his own conclusions rather than having the filmmakers forced upon him although the framing of the story as a flashback from the womans visit to southwestern cameroon as an adult provides some perspective
1,me and my girlfriend annette watched this together and well both commentbr br both of us really enjoyed watching this even though it took some liberties with dickens work a lot of dickens works are somewhat dark and dreary including oliver twist but this movie changed all that it was fun colourful both visually and musically and the characters were more lightheartedbr br travis normally i dont care a lot for musical and dance movies but the tunes in this production were catchy and lively and the choreography was awesomebr br annette thats really saying a lot coming from travis i cant emphasise enough how really good the dance numbers were you can tell for example that those boys really worked hard getting the routines down to perfectionbr br travis three actors really stood out imo nancy shani w bill sykes oliver reed and artful dodger jack wild man that oliver reed can really do a good villain that one scene where you see his eyes thru the mail slot gave me chills down the backawesome and that kid jack wild was a perfect artful dodger and nancy was fantastic man i felt bad when she got killed she can sing too kudos to the casting department on their choices there i hated the oliver twist kid tho he was just too whiny and wimpy for my taste i kept wishing bill sikes would drop him off into the mud during the chase scene and they shouldnt have had him sing eitherbr br annette acting was truly superb in addition to the three stars travis mentioned i felt ron moody fagin did a tremendous job he was so funny and at the same time lightly sinister too the supporting actors were great too harry secombe carried his mr bumble role extremely well and he has a wonderful singing voice i saw mr secombe perform in another movie entitled davy where he played an opera singer with pleasing results the talented harry secombe should have been in a lot more moviesbr br travis as i mentioned earlier the story isnt quite true to the book but imo it was more robust this movie was not boring either as some musicals seem to be and the continuity kept you moving right along with the characters the tunes did not detract from the plot or put you to sleep by being too longbr br annette any musical movie which travis watches completely has to be a rare find and this one is indeed a rare find it is a very easytowatch production which carries the viewer smoothly and enjoyably through to the end in a day when movies all seem to be effects combined with pretty faces this was a refreshing interludebr br our combined rating for this was 85 of 10 well round up to in this casebr br travis i rated this a mainly because the oliver twist kid mark l irritated me and his songs were torture to my overly sensitive ears otherwise it was an outstanding moviebr br annette my rating is a 10 movies dont get much better than this and you can tell everyone involved in this production really worked hard to make it what it wasa masterpiecebr br please dont miss this oneeven if you normally dont like musicals it really is a rare treat
5,wow i went to the video store tonight because i was in the mood for a bad b horror movie and i found this gem i looked at the cover and i thought it looked like just the movie for my mood i brought it home and put it onbr br this movie was not the b horror movie that i had in mind this was much worse i wanted a bad movie but what i got i didnt know that crap like this existed amongst man this movie seemed like a year old wrote and directed it and that is being nice about itbr br i am an aspiring director and this movie made me so mad that someone out there is actually paying this guy to direct movies he needs to work at a garbage dump shoveling crap where he belongsbr br if you are thinking about renting this or buying it i will tell you the same thing that i would tell someone getting ready to commit suicide dont do it its not worth it i really have nothing nice to say about this movie dont do it
2,anyone who could find redeeming value in this piece of crap ought to have their head examined we have the submissive heroinaddicted parttime hooker wife with lacerations all over her body lacerations received from repeated beatings by an abusive son now she is squirting breast milk all over the kitchen floor the release so gained somehow akin to helen keller placing her hands in running water we have the husband who starts out by patronizing a prostitute who just happens to be his daughter shes upset with him because he came too quicklyand ends by murdering his female colleague having sex with her corpse and then chopping her up we have the kid who is relentlessly bullied by his classmates and who comes home and beats his mom you see its all circular deep huh the only decent moment in this horrendous pile of tripe is when the dad murders his sons tormentors its a good thing this turkey was shot on video because otherwise what a waste of expensive film it would be if that guy who thinks artists ought to be interested in this slop is really serious no wonder most people think artists are insane we saw this lousy movie then put on zero woman the accused oh my god it was a tossup as to which one was worse what is going on in japan these days sick sick sick
7,we tend to forget that the masterslave context of the past centuries lead to more than welltended estates powered by large groups of enslaved people and a lot of money for the white owners it lead to a group of people caught in the middle  the offspring resulting from slave owners interferring with their female slavesbr br some of these children just became more slaves and others were freebut free and coloured which back then meant anything but relative to the lot of their siresbr br a class formed around these offspring  the gens de couleur libre or free people of colour  and that class was able to a certain extent to own property raise themselves from downtrodden to educated and to attain a comparative dignity that is to say they werent slaves but they were still exploited to a certain extentbr br often the women lived as mistresses to the white plantation masters and men of wealth set up in their own houses with allowances schooling paid for for their children and a kind of gentility dependent on the respectability they chose to impose on their families in essence they were prostituting themselves to ensure their own prosperity and relative independence from labour  an arrangement called plaagebr br feast of all saints is a beautifully written story about the children of one such woman the result of just such an arrangement with a local gentleman and the people who touched on their lives in both a negative and a positive way the tale was an eyeopener for me a new zealander with no real conception of the blackwhite lines let alone that grey area in the middle where the gens de couleur libre trod gingerlybr br the characters are very three dimensional and have been wellrendered in this adaption of the novel by anne rice the parts are wellcast the costumes are wonderful and the brutal way the lines are drawn out with the blurred areas made all the more distinct by the conflicts the protagonists go through the gens de couleur libre could not marry the whites the slaves could not help themselves and the whites even the sympathetic ones couldnt bear to face the economic reality of doing right by the people they depended onbr br i recommend this story both the novel and the miniseries to everyone unreservedly if you cant handle the truth youll cringe and cower through some parts as one injustice after another is meted out on those of colour both by their white oppressors and by their own people bear in mind though that this is nothing more than reality and this tale is an absorbing way to learn about itbr br i know it may sound callous but this miniseries both entertained me and enthralled me despite the sour taste i found in my mouth at what went on and i thoroughly enjoyed it watch it if not read up on the period because theres a lesson to be learned from it all
7,firstly there are some good things about this film but its all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie in the advertising of this movie that ive seen a large emphasis was on the fact that denise richards is in it but shes a poor actress and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be not that that has anything to do with the movie and whats with that look she gives everyone perhaps its part of the character but like i said the acting still the writing is fine you know who it is all throughout the movie and you can almost predict what is about to happen but not in an irritating way i think the book its based on is probably good judging by the plot line but next time ill read the book to find out rather than watch this
5,i really love this movie i remember one time when i was in 2nd grade my teacher showed it to us on a 16mm film reel this movie however can be a little frightening for 2nd graders such as the scene where bill murders nancy and seeing fagins face for the first time on the screen one of my relatives is sick of seeing this movie because she studied over it in music class if i were a teacher and could grade the people who produced this wonderful film i would give them an a
5,begin spoiler fitfully funny and memorable for mr chongs literal roachsmoking scene chong coolly mashes a stray kitchen cockroach into his pipes bowl lights up coughs and hacks violently for a seeming eternitythen with perfect aplomb and not skipping a beat reloads the bowl properly relights retokes end spoiler alas i began to lose faith less than halfway through the proceedings it occurred to me that the lackadaisical duo are way obnoxious and less than relatable i have come to appreciate the relative sophistication of contemporary stoners harold and kumar i simply prefer brighter company yet the movie is probably a perfect fit for baked frat bros or those viewers who are so feebleminded as to be outwitted by a stoner when they the former are sober notable guest appearance by paul reubens spouting obscenities in prepeewee form
1,a surprising misfire from the usually reliable larry cohen god told me too q etc full moon high tries so hard to be funny and fails miserably even with decent turns by ed mcmahon and kenneth mars alan arkin looks embarrassed throughout his performance and son adam simply looks numb this makes teen wolf look like a comedy classic
0,this movie is great if you enjoy watching bclass movies that is this is a classic college 80s slasher movie in which one song is played throughout the entire soundtrack a horrible film but worth renting to make fun of or just to watch old men pop out of closets with knives kinda funny if you ask me
5,the second coming of suzanne is yet another one of those surrealistic films that tries to come across as extremely sophisticated yet all it does is put the viewer to sleep like other movies of this type there is limited dialogue everyone is much more interested in the visual aesthetic of the shot however the cinematography stinks so there is nothing at all to keep your attentionbr br the video box states that this film is one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen on film yeahsure its right up there with watching such stimulating events as a bucket of ice melting or a turtle walking for a mile 110
0,if you are a crispin glover fan you must see this if you are a sean penn fan you must see this if you are a movie fan in general you must see this if you have no idea who crispin glover is and you have no idea who sean penn is this film will probably still have a lot of value but the more work youve previously seen by crispin or sean the betterbr br this movie is so funny but it is also pure genius there is nothing that i know of that resembles this film it is its own genre i doubt that anything like it will ever be made again i cannot say anything more about exactly why without partially spoiling it and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job at doing that br br in response to any of the reviewers here that gave it a bad review i ask that you view the film again in reality there is no point at which this film could fairly be called boring this is possibly the funniest most entertaining and least boring film ever made and it only gets better with age and repeated viewings a timeless classic that unfortunately very few will be able to claim to have seenbr br beaver trilogy is the brilliant work of director trent harris also responsible for the amazing rubin and ed which crispin glover also stars inbr br unfortunately copies of this film are rare and hard to find i managed to find a vhs version after some diligent searching though and there are a couple of ways to find it that i know of but i really wish someone would put this onto a dvd

7,considering the risk of showing samesex relationships before the late 1980s personal best could have done better to play the samesex relationship between hemingway chris cahill and donnelly tory skinner as a more than experimental phase of cahills lifebr br it seems to me that the creators of this movie threw in the samesex relationship between two fairly attractive women in order to attract viewers also consider the 90 seconds of exposing the crotches of several women jumping backwards over a high jump pole this random scene had very little relevance to the movie and it appeared as though this was done merely to keep the audience interested in this bland movie i suppose the producers were trying to counteract the boring plot and the even more boring setting of the movie the 1980 oregon track and field competitionbr br this review may seem harsh but it is the truth the exploitation of young muriel hemingways body and the samesex relationship ruined any credit that i would have given to this filmbr br pepper thompson
2,this film is really bad with a script full of memorable lines and incredibly bad performances the special effects are also bad not the worst ones i have seen either and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it to believe it just two short themes 30 seconds long or so are repeated constantly throughout the whole filmbr br all in all one of the worst films i have ever seen
5,once upon a time there was a director by the name of james he brought us wonderfully thrilling sciencefiction such as terminator and aliens these movies were the stuff blockbusters were made of and he looked to have a fantastic future ahead of him as the dawn of computer generated special effects landed upon the film industry terminator showed gave us glimpses of what was possible in this new erabr br and then it happened1997countless awardsobscene amounts of moneyoutlandish barrage of advertisingmaximum profit margintitanic was herebr br i have never ever been one to jump on the bandwagon and be overly critical for the sake of it in fact i have often taken the opposite stance from the majority just to get an argument going titanic however was a film i only took one single positive out of  that of kate winslett being absolutely gorgeous throughoutbr br quickly  the dialogue was like something out of beverly hills 90210 the acting was more wooden than my nephews tree house images meant to terrify were actually comical man falling from ship and hitting propeller historically false dont even get me started because theres too much it had dire theme music up there with the bodyguard for cheese and the pointless love story was so tedious self absorbing and pathetic that it disrespected the plight of everyone else involved i was glad when he died and disappointed when she did notbr br it was plainly obvious from the word go that this picture was designed to appeal to mtv watching bubblegum chewing boywithcar chasing teenage girls decaprio himself resembled something less heroic than the weedy member of a boy band who would drag their sexstarved boyfriends out for a three and a half hour chickflick hoping to get lucky later the worst aspect was that it did not stop at that point millions of dumbed down culture vultures went to see this expensive waste of celluloid because it cost so much to produce it must be great and steve and barbara said it was good and they know their movies br br the crowning glory arrived when titanic swept the boards at the academy awards king james of hollywood had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the fatal evening on which his three and a half hour farce was based it looked to me as if he was praying for forgiveness after making a fortune off inaccurately portraying the circumstances that lead to the death of a lot of people br br however if people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy into this kind of rubbish they deserve to get ripped off good luck to hollywood if that is how they want to make money id do it if i had those kind of chances in lifebr br it is right up there on my all time worst movies list with other silly historically falsehuman interest tripe like the patriot and pearl harbor
1,a good idea badly implemented while that could summarize 99 of the scifi channels movies it really applies here i love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed and i like action movies and i like all of the main actors so this could have been great however despite some good acting this movie fails due to bill platts bad writing and directingbr br another review made the good point of needing to know where youre going so you can get there this movie doesnt its put together in such a haphazard way that you know the words second draft are not in bill platts vocabulary there is one scene that is entirely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone noticing this scene even begins and ends with them driving a car so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middlebr br this movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others some to the point where you can guess the entire plot up front it also had a habit of aborting a fight early probably just because they couldnt afford it there are also a few laughably bad scenes where the plot is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed toxic adhesive seriously what is thatbr br if you are a fan of shiri appleby watch this movie because shes ok she does manage to break out of her roswell persona a few times and make for a good tough chick but not always john de lancie plays the same character he plays in everything hes ever done since playing q back in sttng so thats nothing newbr br in all i gave this movie a 410 rating
2,excellent gritty and true portrayal of pioneer ranch life on the western plains with an emphasis on the womans role and place a moving film lovingly made and based on real people and their actual experiences low budget independent film never made any money definitely not the romanticized unrealistic hollywood version of pioneer life
0,the folk who produced this masterful film have done fine service to a novel that stands as perhaps the best fiction work centering upon human guilt and human responsibility ever published nolte takes the role of howard w campbell jr and makes it his own remaining true to vonneguts depiction of a man who has lost all to and for lovebr br no weaknesses in this fine adaptation
5,so you might be reading some of the comments posted on this film and you might be thinking to yourself huh there were sure a bunch of rave reviews posted on december 30 funny thing is most of these rave reviews sound like theyre coming from the same person or at best a small coordinated group of open house groupies the truth my friends is that this film is truly unwatchable just because its independent doesnt mean it gets a free pass if youre going to make a musical whether on film or on stage whether on broadway or at the local community playhouse you should probably make sure that a your actors can sing b your actors can dance c you have decent sound equipment d you have a wellwritten score and e you have lyrics that are witty and charming even anthony rapp cant save this one its one of those unfortunate moviegoing experiences where i actually felt deeply embarrassed for everyone involved
0,thre isnt a single scorsese movie id place on a list of my favorite movies but this is the best thing ive run through my dvd player in about five years scorseses patient elucidation of favorite film moments and how hollywood works is incredibly gracious calm and intelligent br br its dvdsides worth of material it would have to be a british production since everything about american corporate culture would have trampled the quiet methodical no frills putthefocusonthecontent approach that is taken here and an american production would have demanded he say he liked only movies that were popular favorites i wish everyone took a page from his love of movies you should love the movies you do for personal idiosyncratic and specific reasons not just more metoo votes for the godfather etc people have no clue what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies if they did movies would be more interesting than they are scorsese does know what ideas are being explored and that makes him a compelling involved speaker on the topic i really appreciate his articulate generous interviews over the last decadebr br on a negative note scorsese is best when hes excited to show you some obscure movie rather than when hes didactically teaching you something wellestablished about film history and i do wish he pluck those three hairs out of the bridge of his nose its very distracting
6,let me say first that this show was top tier when john ritter was there upon his death the show did drop off a bit but the producers didnt give up on the show adding james garner and david spade to the regular cast from 2003 to 2005br br the show centers around the hennessy family paul john ritter may he rest in peace his wife cate katey sagal their daughters bridget kaley cuoco kerry amy davidson and their son rory martin spanjers when ritter was on the show i would shriek in laughter and proud to admit it i am but now that hes gone ill only laugh a little with the occasional hearty laugh im very glad that i fell for this shows trance after ritters untimely death because it made the eps with ritter so much betterbr br ritters character is just so well acted and well rounded that you cant help but love him he is always bossing the girls around about dating but he really wants them to be happy its the ultimate daddy hates boyfriend entertainmentbr br katey sagal is great as well and she too is a likable character after ritters death her character provides such good influence and strength for not only her kids but i believe sagal has shaped the lives of cuoco davidson and spanjers because she and ritter had been friends for a long timebr br the funniest person on the show would have to be bridget hennessy played by kaley cuoco she is the ultimate blonde gorgeous slow dimwitted yet she is a smart person she is off the wall hilarious with her innocent blonde humor and how conceited she isbr br amy davidson can get a tad annoying as kerry but thats the purpose of her character the only fault of the show is that the show never really gives kerry anything to be happy about shes always after bridget and her character feels like its just thrown in therebr br martin spanjers as the lone hennessy son is hysterical and when ritter is on the show hes mostly comic material upon the death of ritter the show does provide some story lines for rorybr br david spade and james garner are all nothing but laughs with the occasional side story for cj spades character garner plays cates father as a bit of background informationbr br all in all i give this show a great review because it is a great show that had a tragic event happen that crippled it youll enjoy itbr br 910 spy
1,words really cant describe how bad this film is i thought zandalee was bad but at least that had some nice shots and the occasional good chin stroking moment here and there to stop you from nodding off this is just laughable terrible script poor direction awful acting and you know what i cant think of a single thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it isnt too long if you want 100 minutes worth of entertainment book yourself in at the dentist and have some root canal work  far more enjoyable and much better value for money assuming that you need it incidentally i need to type 10 lines of text to complete this review  please do not buy this movie it is terrible
3, possible spoiler br br youd think a story involving archie grey owl  an englishman posing as a red indian  would have a massive amount of humour involved  in fact id say the only way to treat a film like this where a remarkable man cons the gullible public is to treat it as a comedy  however richard attenborough commits something akin to a crime by making grey owl a serious drama  worse  hes made an extremely dire film too  pierce brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and the romantic subplot between grey owl and pony  played by the equally wooden annie gaupeau  lacks any type of on screen chemistry  but to be fair to the cast their not helped with the script which fails to portray archie as the cheeky chappy he is of fooling everyone into believing hes a native american  the producers and screenwriter have made the major error of having the film centre around the plot twist of archie being an englishman  thats why i wrote  possible spoiler  its not actually revealed untill late in the film that the title character is english  but its obvious that everyone who viewed this movie knew that beforehand hence theres absolutely no surprise involvedbr br yes i do agree with everyone that the scenery is lovely and that it has a deep ecological message which isnt actually a new concept  theodore roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the 20th century if truth be told  and it should also be remembered that with the exception of soylent green  and possibly the two towers if you want to class it as having a green message  that there hasnt actually been a great ecological film  in fact most environmentally concious films suck and that includes grey owl  a film that unsurprisingly had a serious problem in finding a distributor
6,i dont often give one star reviews but the computer wont let me do negative numbersbr br the opening titles tell us were in deep water already although this is a low budget exploitation film there are 17 producers credited no nobr br at the beginning of the story abusive husband kenneth comes home to his family in an upscale gated community the house is a pigsty his wife della kim basinger has let the children run amok all daybr br ok were already in deep water ms basinger was 55 years old when the film came out uh are these her children or grandchildren its christmas eve della drives to the mall a lengthy scene that could have been cut to bludgeon home the idea of eeeeeeevil male aggression rampant in the universe she drives past football players in full uniform playing in pouring rain on christmas eve sure for a bonus she sees a vehicle with a slaughtered deer tied to itbr br we get some actual suspense in the driving scenes though its raining and traffic is bad first we see della try to drive and smoke at the same time then later della tries to drive and talk on her cell phone at the same time at one point turning completely around to check the cluttered back seat for the charger for the phonebr br she wanders the mall sees an old friend from college tries to buy stuff but her credit card is declined gosh maybe her husband is grumpy because hes going broke but thats too complicated for the script to followbr br in the parking lot she runs afoul of the most ludicrous gang in the history of films one white boy lukas hass watching his career go down the toilet one black one asian and one hispanic imagine a company of up with people gone to the bad and youll have the ideabr br although they have a gun she gives them attitude a mall cop comes to investigate the ruckus and they shoot him in the head firing more than once the parking lot is crowded as can be people everywhere and nobody noticesbr br della escapes in her car and rather than choosing a police station or well lighted safe area she drives to a construction site where she kills all four bad boys one at a time with simply the tools literally at handbr br major spoiler aheadbr br she drives back home the car poops out so she walks through the pouring rain checks on the children goes downstairs and when her husband petulantly asks what she got him at the mall shows him the gun and shoots him at point blank rangebr br the experience with the four punks was supposed to result in personal empowerment for della instead we know that her children will probably spend christmas in foster care or a group home because the state will collect them while she answers to murder one charges the four punks can be classified as justifiable homicide in self defense the husband different storybr br im so glad i saw this on cable if id seen it in a theater did it get any release id have been furious as is im just sad seeing talents like ms basinger and mr haas waste themselves on garbage like thisbr br one very good thing though this was written and directed by susan montford ms montford has not gotten another writing or directing credit since passing this turd there is justice in the world
0,for all of you that dont speak swedish the swedish original title of this film rnarna translates into something in the line of the robbers this fact is the main problem i have with the film cause its not really about the robbers at all its about a young woman working for the swedish police researching robberies a regular desk job one would think but this girl is soon out on the field taking matters into her own hands as the story goes even shooting one of the robbers exactly weve seen this before the fact that theres a rather interesting twist to the plot halfway through doesnt really help as the ending is just as clich as the first two thirds of the filmbr br what saves it from being just another mainstream film is the fact that its masterfully executed in all ways that the actors are as great as they are and dont overact and that the director really manages to keep it as thrillingly exciting as it is for the most of the storybr br one thing that i really loved about this film is the fact that its music sets the right mood when its needed but is absent for the rest of the time which gives a nice sense of reality to the shootouts and carchases spread throughout the film a nice touch the fact that michael persbrandt is one of the few swedish actors that often tend to get typecasted sadly hurts the film as you know that hes not going to just play the boyfriend of the heroine and be a supporting character in the background but thats something you have to neglectbr br all in all its an entertaining film that steals more money in its plot than time from you 710
1,this really doesnt match up to castle of cagliostro lupin isnt as funny or wacky or as hyperactive the scenery and music are uninspired and plot just isnt interesting br br the only good thing about this un is the nudity only in the uncut version provided by fujiko it helped spice up some of the tedious scenes coc had a formidable villain and set up the movie for some imaginative setpieces the locations in tsotg are not very vivid or engaging br br zenigata goemon and jigen dont even provide decent sideshow entertainment this time its like they were just filling a contractual obligation by appearing br br the dvd is in fullframe with dolby stereo sound it has a decent amount of extras including quite a few trailers but one curious thing there is no chapter selection on the disc or timecode displayed on the player once inserted though you can still skip to the next scene number using the remote
4,this was a wonderful film how these women tried to save their husbands i thought that the performances of the actors were great i had to think about the film for a very long time i think that every student should see this film so that they can think about war relationships friendship and love i liked the film because it told and showed me how strong love can be i wish i could be so strong as a woman i really liked it because it told me something about relationships and that is what i like to see in a movie i think you can compare the film with der untergang the pianist if you put these three films together you have a great sight of what happened during the war we should remember something like the war forever
1,murder by numbers is one of those movies that you expect is madefortv but isnt considering the only actor of any note is bullock although michael pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things it isnt a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things like remembering to lock your front door when you go out or putting clothes back on when you come out of the showerbr br bullock plays cassie mayweather a cop with personal issues dont they all together with her new partner a wetlooking ben chaplin she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman nothing unusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think theyve planned and executed the perfect murder as the investigation continues a battle of wills emerges between cassie and the main suspect richie haywood ryan goslingbr br the crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless bullock though she is very nice to look at is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as rodney dangerfield actually hed be better chaplin for his sins is a complete nonentity and i feel sorry that he has to put this film on his cv in his attempt to break into hollywood at least gosling and pitt as the conniving sneering suspects acquit themselves adequately as if dodgy leads werent bad enough a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable but illogical ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to runbr br murder by numbers has absolutely nothing going for it even a pointless nude scene by bullock wouldnt redeem it well just a little but still not enough to save it forgettable predictable and redundant  this is one film that isnt going to move the cop genre forward as cassie probably says on her next case theres nothing to see here people move along keep moving
5,oh boy where do i go with this one herendous acting weak plot stupid deaths pointless nuditybr br this isnt entertainmentthis is hellbr br hellbr br dont waste your money time or life on this pit of evilbr br its justgod damn is this movie awful tom savini why why would you waste your life on this crap this movie not worth it id rather snort crack and smash my head up against a wall than watch thisthis sinful act againbr br please take my advice and stay the fk away from this elephant turd of a film no you know what i shouldnt even have to call this thing a film just stay away
1,this was a wonderful little american propaganda film that is both highly creative and openly discusses the nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed while late 1944 and into 1945 would reveal just how evil and horrific they were this film unlike other hollywood films to date is the most brutally honest film of the era i have seen regarding nazi atrocitiesbr br the film begins in a courtroom in the futureafter the war is over the film was made in 1944the war ended in may 1945 in this fictitious world court a nazi leader is being tried for war crimes wilhelm grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal grimms life since 1919 in a series of flashbacks at first it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how grimm was pushed to join the nazis however after a while it becomes very apparent that grimm is just a sadistic monster these episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate dramabr br all in all the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars secondtier actors there are many compelling scenes and performancesespecially the very prescient jewish extermination scene towards the end that cant help but bring you close to tears it was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some supercreative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first overall its a mustsee for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good filmbr br fyithis is not meant as a serious criticism of the film but hitler was referred to as that paper hanger this is a reference to the myth that hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper this is in fact not truepreviously hed been a starving artist homeless person and served well in the german army in wwi a horrible person yes but never a paper hanger
4,its nothing more than a weird coincidence that i decided to watch starlift on the 59th anniversary of the day in june 1950 when president trumans ordered us forces into the korean war starlift you see is set largely at travis air force base in california in the years when it was being used as a staging post for soldiers being shipped out to fight in korea but youd need to do your own research to know this because not once during the film is the name korea mentioned we see transport aircraft flying out fresh troops and returning with wounded soldiers but theres no mention of where these men will be fighting or getting injured which is kind of weird for a film designed to wave the flag and salute americas men in uniform released in december 1951 by warner brothers starlift is a very obvious effort to replicate the success of the studios starstudded world war two homefront morale booster hollywood canteen this 1944 crowdpleaser told the story of two soldiers spending their last three nights of leave hanging out at the famous armed forces nightclub in la hoping to get a date with joan leslie but really it was just an excuse for warners to trot out every star under contract from joan crawford john garfield and barbara stanwyck to peter lorre bette davis sydney greenstreet and more starlift features two air force soldiers hoping to meet fictional starlet nell wayne a masklike janice rule and persuading a bunch of warner bros stars to put on a show for the departing troops but in place of crawford garfield et al the best the brothers warner could scrape up in 1951 were doris day ruth roman gordon macrae virginia mayo gene nelson and phil harris with fleeting appearances by james cagney randolph scott and a clearly embarrassed looking gary cooper this threadbare cast whose combined star power would struggle to illuminate a standard lamp is perfectly matched by the crummy production values presumably in an effort to save money several long scenes were shot using really really bad back projection how bad is it you can see the join where the screen meets the floor of the soundstage to describe starlift as a sloppy lazy and third rate movie is to do a disservice to films which are sloppy lazy and third rate its just terrible avoid it
0,oh what a condescending movie set in los angeles the center of the universe from the pov of hollywood filmmakers this movie tries to be a deep social commentary on contemporary american angstbr br stereotyped smarmy characters of widely varying socioeconomic backgrounds cross paths in their everyday humdrum lives the plot is disjointed and desultory numerous unimaginative plot contrivances keep the film going like a driveby shooting an abandoned baby left in the weeds a gang of thugs intimidating a lawyer a guy flying through the night sky over the city a kid at summer campbr br and through all these events the one constant is the generous helping of sociological insights imparted through the dialogue as characters compare notes on their life experiences one character tells another when you sit on the edge of that thing the grand canyon you realize what a joke we people are  those rocks are laughing at me i could tell me and my worries its real humorous to that grand canyonbr br and another character pontificates about the meaning of it all theres a gulf in this country an ever widening abyss between the people who have stuff and the people who dont have  its like this big hole has opened up in the ground as big as the  grand canyon and whats come pouring out  is an eruption of rage and the rage creates violence br br aside from the horribly unnatural and forced dialogue aside from the shallow smarmy characters aside from the dumb plot the storys pace is agonizingly slow acting is uninspired and perfunctory the films tone is smug and selfsatisfied in the scripts contempt for viewersbr br this was a film project approved by hollywood suits who fancy themselves as omnipotent gurus looking down from on high they think their film will be a startling revelation to us lowly unknowing movie goers eager to learn about the real meaning of american social change
0,this could well be the worst film ive ever seen despite what mikshelt claims this movie isnt even close to being historically accurate it starts badly and then its all downhill from there we have hitlers father cursing his own bad luck on the fact that hed married his niece they were in fact second cousins hitlers mother klara called his father alois uncle because alois had been adopted and raised by klaras grandfather and brought up as his son when he was really his nephew alois was much older than klara and so as a child shed got into the habit of calling alois unclebr br the scene in the trenches where hitler is mocked by his fellow soldiers and decides to take it out on his dog is simply a disgrace and an insult to the intelligence of all viewers we see hitler chase the dog through the trench when he catches up with the poor thing he proceeds to thrash it for disobeying him in the distance we see and hear his fellow soldiers continue to mock and chastise the cowardly little man but then a shell lands directly on his persecutors and every last one we are told is killed outright how then if hitler was the only person to survive the scene did this tale of brutality and cowardice come to be told did hitler himself go around boasting about it  i dont think sobr br next up hitler bullies and intimidates a poor stressed out and war weary jewish officer into giving him an iron cross i can only assume that this jewish officer had been a pawnbroker before fighting for the fatherland and had thoughtfully brought along some pledged medals from his shop because im certain that iron crosses were not being handed out as shown in this comic farcebr br all the grotesque clichs are here not least the calming and hypnotic effect of wagners music upon the little man if only the producers had kept ian kershaw on side then they might have discovered that franz lehars merry widow was more likely to float the fuhrers boat than any flying dutchman from the cannon of richard wagnerbr br hitler may have been responsible for the deaths of 60 million people but how can he ever be forgiven for his appalling taste in musicbr br i could go on but id be at it for hoursbr br give it a miss
0,hamlet is by far my favorite of all of shakespeares works branaugh is one heck of an actor his portrayal of this was just amazing his soliloquies were breathtaking for as long as it was it is rare for a film to hold my interest however i was engrossed in this particular piece i recommend this to anyone both fan of shakespeare and those not so much this has everything the modern world looks for in its films murder betrayal and deceit not to knock mel gibsons version but branaughs touches the whole work this leaves no stone unturned when you finish the film it will feel as if you read the play yourself um how you say two thumbs up
6,snl is pretty funny but people who say this is like watching a short skit on snl is a little dumb minded its nothing like snl its just a stupid piece of crapbr br andy samberg tries to act like jon heder but fails although jon heder is only funny in napoleon dynamite andy tries his hardest and people think hes funnybr br only funny people in the movie were danny mcbride and bill hader the only part that was decently funny with andy was the pool partbr br they could have made the quiet place a lot better if they didnt make the falling scene freaking minutesbr br the part where hes pronouncing his hs more is retarded they try going with it too long and half the time it looks like andy is laughing while he actshes a horrible actor and doesnt deserve to be in a moviebr br this movie is a joke and is for the simple minded people with the brain of a 10 year old level of comedy which is about half the united states
4,oh dear  yet another example of  oireland  and religion  no doubt well be seeing some depressing nonsense featuring some  hunky and macho freedom fighters  from the ira  well that was my initial reaction when the credits started but just over an hour and a half later i was in a state of shock  what a superb movie br br the story starts on the day of the wedding between sean cloney and sheila kelly in the 1950s  there is a slight problem since theyre getting married in the catholic church and that is sheila is a protestant but in order for the wedding to happen sheila takes a pledge that her children will be brought up catholic and attend the catholic school when theyre old enough  the story  which is set in the 1950s  then jumps forward a few years when the cloney daughters are about to start school but sheila has decided theyll be attending the local protestant school much to the disgust of local priest father stafford  from there things escalate br br let me put my cards on the table and state that despite having both irish catholic and scottish protestant heritage i was brought up as agnostic and have considered myself as an atheist throughout my adult life  in fact when it comes to religion i consider myself a marxist and religion is a cynical weapon used to manipulate people  a love divided shows what happens when self appointed moral guardians take it upon themselves to tell other people what to think and believe  may i have the temerity to state that if karl marx saw this movie hed love it and call it a masterpiece  perhaps i shouldnt since the drama of this story shows what happens when other people do your thinking for you br br in reply to the couple of reviewers who have claimed this movie is propaganda of the worst sort i dont claim to know the exact details of what happened in county wexford and theres no denying that father stafford and his flock of catholic sheep are portrayed as being the bad guys but sheila isnt blameless herself  think about a woman living in a rural village in 1950s ireland who takes a pledge to bring her children up as catholics then changes her mind and believes there will be no consequences of this  this is a warning against taking pledges and not keeping to them  not only that but she disappears to let other people pick up the pieces of their shattered lives  theres also something that no one else has picked up upon and that is that the only character with any type of moral sense is former ira man andy bailey who is shown as being gallant not because he was a former ira member  that makes a change  were not talking about the devils own here  but simply because he is an atheist who has decided to think for himself br br a love divided is a superb movie that has a lot to say for itself  all of which i agree with  if theres any sort of criticism its that it feels too much like a tvm rather than a cinematic movie but believe me i can live with that and is essential viewing to anyone who thinks religion is the opium of the masses
2,this is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic achievement from the very start i was utterly hooked into the true story when lt viktor burakov stephan rea weeps while performing the autopsies on the remains of the childrens bodies this then is the compelling story of andrei chikatilo wonderfully played by jeffrey demunn the green mile in fact he plays it so well and so sympathetically that the viewer almost starts to pity him until we remember what he is the psychiatrist dr alexandr bukhanovsky wonderfully played by max von sydow was utterly believable in every detail and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the soviet union is made all too apparent by the behaviour of the local communist commissar bondarchuk played by joss ackland for me though the outstanding performance was from donald sutherland proving once again what a superb character actor he really is i was almost in tears when he told burakov how the fbi had so closely followed and admired his work this film puts silence of the lambs into the shade from the atmospheric and bleak soviet landscape to the superlative performances by everyone involved br br i rate this film 1010
5,ok first of all steve irwin rest in peace you were loved by many fans nowthis movie wasnt a movie at all it was the crocodile hunter tv program with bad acting bad scripts and bad directing in between steve capturing or teaching us about animals he was entertaining as an animal seekerspecialist millions will miss him but the whole movie idea was a big mistake the plot was so broken it was almost nonexistent casting was horrible the acting wasnt even worth elementary schoollevel actors the direction must be faulted as well if you cant get a halfway decent performance out of your actors no matter how bad the script is you must not be that good in the first place i could have written a better script i wish i had never been to see this movie of course i watched it for 150 for me 150 for my son while out with friends who insisted upon seeing this instead of scooby doo live action my son who is not so discriminating liked the movie alright but he still has never asked to see it again if you want fond memories of steve irwin buy his series on dvd avoid this movie like the plague if i were steve i know i wouldnt want to be remembered for this movie respect him avoid this movie
6,the only scenes wich made me laugh where the ones with christopher walken in itthe crazy filmdirectorthe rest of the movie was just boringin the first hour or so nothing really happensjokes which supposed to be funny arent and zeta jones douglas is really overactingjulia roberts does a routine job of the former ugly duck yeah right into the girl next door where did i see this before who gets the guyfor shorti really didnt care what would happen with the main charactersif cusack really fell of the building in a suicide attempt the movie could have been more interresting to watch
0,this is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just have to get because it just looks so horribly bad and indeed we couldnt take most of it there was a lot of fastforwarding going onbr br but then we came across a scene where robert englund seduces the female protagonist her name somehow slips my mind at this time cripes ive never watched a single scene from a film so many times im estimating forty or so and ive never laughed so hard in my life you see englund has this thing for showing off his loins i last saw the film a couple months ago but i cant stop laughing as i type anyway the scene is a montage of shots englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl englund riding a horse naked and some mysterious woman fellating a snakes head this is absolute genius youve got to see it for yourself
7,when i first went to watch the shining i was expecting a decent film from what i had heard about it and i liked a lot of stanley kubricks other work but when i started to watch it it was so much better than i thought it would beat times i seriously felt ridiculously uneasy and i couldnt take my eyes of the screen still theres something very disturbing about everything in the film now some people dont like kubricks version of the shining since it doesnt entirely follow stephen kings book but in my opinion both kubricks versionthe miniseries and the book are all greatjack nicholson gives an awesome performanceif you are looking for a good original movie that will keep you thinking even after the movies over then watch the shining
0,i agree with everyone who says that this series was the best of the spy genre my husband and i were captivated by it when it first aired in the us and watched every episode i tried at that time to purchase the series i did tape all of it but was told by wgbh that it was not available i even considered writing to ian holm to see if he might have a copy like others i purchased and read the deighton series in part to understand the complicated plot if the original version ever comes available on dvd ill be among the first in line to snap up a copy ian holms portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous bernard samson was amazing he is always amazing
4,i got this dvd from a friend who got it from someone else and that probably keeps going on even the cover of the dvd looks cheap as is the entire movie gunshots and fist fights with delayed sound effects some of the worst actors ive seen in my life a very simple plot it made me laugh till my stomach hurt with very few financial resources i must admit it looked pretty professional seen as a movie it was one of the 13 in a dozen wannabe gangsta flicks nobodys waiting for so if youre tired and want a cheap laugh see this movie if not throw it out of the window
0,its so rare to find a literary work adequately translated to the screen that i may have rated this film higher than it deserves but not by much as a longtime student of vonneguts works i have no hesitation in recommending the film to his readers at least to those that love him as i do the casting is inspired nolte is understated in triumph bewildered in defeat decisive in judgment sheryl lee is luscious throughout but her handling of the treacherous resi and her tragic crescendo almost makes you forget her beauty alan arkin delivers a totally lovable but equally treacherous soviet spybr br do not feel you have to read mother night to appreciate the film though if you havent read mother night you will probably want to after viewing the filmbr br notice the shifts from color to blackandwhite and back again and dont miss the final symbolism of campbells noose watch also for kurt vonneguts cameo near the end of the filmbr br bing crosbys white christmas will never sound the same i write in middecember when the song is getting heavy radio play and its driving me nuts
4,i cant believe that those praising this movie herein arent thinking of some other film i was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful but the script or lack thereof makes for a film thats also pointless on the plus side the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent but when youve got a sows ear to work with you cant make a silk purse ben g fans should stick with just about any other movie hes been in dorothy s fans should stick to galaxina peter b fans should stick to last picture show and target fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to peter bs amazingly awful book killing of the unicorn
1,angela johnson pamela springsteenyes shes related to bruce the killer from the first film is up to her old tricks again shes one of the counselors at camp rolling hills as long as the girls at camp are nice and stay away from sex drugs and swearing things are fine but a few step over the line and angela kills themcracking bad jokes all the waybr br the original sleepaway camp was a vicious and nasty splatter film but had some good points to it this is vicious and nasty too but has no good points to it the plot has been done to death and this adds nothing new to the formula there are plenty of gory killings in here people are burnt alive heads are cut off throats slashed but all the gore is so obviously fake it actually become comical this also has the smallest amount of campers ive ever seen and virtually everyone is far too old for their roles especially higgins as expected theres the gratuitous female nudity here provided by the tremendously untalented valerie hartman and the obligatory good girlgood boy team renne estevez and tony higgins with the sole exception of springsteen and higgins the acting is lousyeven by slasher movie standards theres also a cruel edge to this movie in which one character is drowned in an outhouse boring and sick with a stupid plot pointless nudity and bad gore skip it
2,the silent onepanel cartoon henry comes to fleischer studios billed as the worlds funniest human in this dull little cartoon betty long past her prime thanks to the production code is running a pet shop and leaves henry in charge for far too long  five minutes a bore
2,i saw this movie about a week ago and still keep thinking about it i was very moved by this movie i found the characters very believable and likable almost to a fault as in real life though sometimes people disappoint as was the case with leo who even though i liked his character i could not have been more disappointed when he was willing to have unprotected sex even though fully aware of his hiv status i was also disappointed with leo for rejecting the medicine available to him and the awful way he treated marcel when he decided to ship him back home on the train i think this movie showed in a very real way why hiv numbers are up in young gay men this is in no way meant to bash gays i am gay and movie very well could have been made about a young straight person who makes bad choices and seems unaware of the consequences to himself and others the only part of the movie i couldnt understand was why the gay friendly family was unwilling to include marcel in leos illness to the point of not allowing him to go to the funeralbr br i think the biggest message from this movie is that whether gay or straight is do not have unprotected sex
3,end game started well the least said about the end the better it seemed like things were happening just to keep the plot going for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive intelligent person half way through does something really stupid and totally out of character we are given no reason for this apart from the next scene wouldnt make sense without it the whole story could have been told in about 30 minutes it would have made an average tv political drama the brilliant cuba gooding jr is very watchable however and james woods does an admirable job consideringbr br the end game was honestly one of the worst films ive ever seenand thats saying something ive seen gigli
5,this movie is all about subtlety and the difficulty of navigating the evershifting limits of mores race relations and desire granted it is not a movie for everyone there are no car chases no buildings exploding no murders the drama lies in the tension suggested by glances minimal gestures spatial boundaries lighting and things left  sometimes very ostensibly  unsaid its about identity memory community belonging the different parts of the movie work together to reinforce the leitmotifs of self and other identity desire limits and loss it will reward the attentive and sensitive viewer it will displease those whose palates require explosive massive spicy action it is a beautifully filmed human story that is all
2,a journey of discovery this film follows the lives of one family living in a sleepy island town in british columbia languorous and dreamy the inhabitants are satisfied to allow life to go on around them until a young freshfaced teacher with new ideas arrives and brings with her life from the mainland slowly their indolent state is awakened the father and principal of the local school looks for excitement the mother for stability the oldest daughter for love and the youngest for power while not an incredible or groundbreaking piece of cinema the movie is quietly enjoyable and good for a tired night when the wind is blowing unfortunately i doubt anyone outside of canada will find it easily accessible
4,if there has ever been a worse comedy than gray matters i am unaware of it the new york jewish comedys funny premise is that siblings sam  gray are mistaken for a couple and so decide to fix sam up with a girlfriend only to find that gray is equally attracted to their target  charlie the revelation that gray is secretly gay is apparently only a surprise to her there is a deeply offensive wedding sequence a deeply embarrassing drunk act from moynahan and graham and a performance that would embarrass forests everywhere for its woodenness from tom cavanagh sissy spacek demonstrates a complete inability to do comedy and will want this excised from her resume molly shannon plays the homely friend with lumpen insouciance only alan cumming emerges with any credit but is seriously underemployed and given nothing with which to work the whole disaster is cemented by grahams bizarre eyerolling performance culminating with the penultimate scene where she wears a comedy hat and an overcoat despite the scene being set in a lesbian bar it is astonishing that this film was ever released it has no redeeming feature and should be avoided at all costs
1,i love the way that this game can make you literally jump out of your seat while you are playing it the way that the screen jumps and flashes when you get hit its very realistic while at the same time you have to remember that its just a game and your not really there the sound effects and audio are amazing there are a lot of weapons and different spells to cast and you can even choose which spells to make stronger or not you get this stone that can knock back enemies while you recover mana to blast your foes with even more magic the best part is that the whole time you are playing it you are really jumpy and afraid of what might lurk around the next corner or what might jump out behind you if you want to get the full experience try playing it with head phones on
2,robert taylor as the mad buffalo hunter charlie gilson is the main character in this film at the beginning i was thinking that charlie would end up redeeming himself like john wayne in the searchers or james stewart in the naked spur but as the film goes along gilson keeps doing more atrocities until you realize there is no hope for him stewart granger is sandy mckenzie who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that the buffaloes will soon be gone and he becomes disgusted by the act of killing gilson is a natural killer who makes no distinction between animals or human beings debra paget as the indian girl is a surprising character considering the self imposed censorship of that time she lies with gilson in total resignation even though she hates him the last scene of a frozen gilson is unforgettable
0,i have never seen a show as good as full house full house puts all of the newer shows to shame big time anyone who has never seen it which i dont see how it is possible should see it it is a great show for anyone of any age full house will make you laugh it will make you cry it will amaze you true some people feel that there are some cheesy aspects to the show but the positive aspects out weigh all of the cheesy aspects full house ran its first episode on september 22 1987 entitled our very first show and ran its last episode on may 23 1995 entitled michelle rides again part iibr br the plot of the show is very believable danny tanner bob saget losses his wife pam in an accident involving a drunk driver danny has his brother in law jesse katsopolis john stamos which is pams younger brother and danny also brings in his best friend joey gladstone dave coulier to help him raise his three daughters dannys daughters are named dj candice cameronbure stephanie jodie sweetin and michelle marykate and ashley olsenjoey and jesse plan on moving in with danny and his three girls for a few months just to help out and end up living with them for eight years which is the number of years the show ran forbr br the following is a short description of some of the characters and the actoractress who played himher john stamos jesse john stamos is a great actor he plays jesse jesse is a rock star waiting to get his big break in full house john stamos does a great job portraying his character he looked and played music like his idol elvis presleybr br bob saget danny bob saget is also a great actor he looses his wife in car accident involving a drunk driver he has to raise three girls without a having the girls mother bob saget does a great job portraying a single parent who works full time and still has time to raise his three girlsbr br dave coulier joey one word can describe dave coulier funny he is great playing the character of joey was perfect for him he does a great job playing the standup comedian waiting for his big breakbr br candice cameronbure dj she is a tremendous actress she plays the oldest sister dj which is short for donna jo she is one of the best actresses i have ever seen her acting ability in full house was very believablebr br jodie sweetin stephanie two simple words can describe jodie sweetin incredibly amazing i wish i could say every thing that i would like to say about jodie but i would use up the 1000 word maximum just on her she got her start in a kids show called mother goose stories and when she came to full house she blew the audiences and creators mind her great looks and absolutely amazing acting ability helped to make the show the success that it was according to dave coulier jodie was supposed to be the star of the show it was supposed to be where she was going to get her big break jodie at five years old when the show first aired could hit every line perfectly she showed great enthusiasm most young kids cant do this as you can probably guess jodie sweetin stephanie is my favorite character in full housebr br marykate and ashley olsen michelle great actress full house is where they got their start they received the part of michelle because they were the only babies who did not cry while in front of a camerabr br there are many more cast members that should be recognized these are the original characters from when the show first went on the air in 1987br br the only negative thing that i can say is how full house became the michelle show towards the end i think it was to focused on her towards the end especially when i think jodie and candice were much better at actingbr br full house is a great show for everyone it can teach you a lot one of the biggest things it can teach you is that everyone can live a great life even if a tragedy such as loosing a family member occurs full house continues to attract new fans with all this said there is only a couple things left to say full house will never die and thank you the cast of full house for giving everyone a show that they can enjoy
7,i think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943 though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness the film is set in 1940just before the entry of the us into the war paul lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family hes a german who has spent seven years fighting the nazis and avoiding capture bette davis is his very understanding and longsuffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time as the film begins they are crossing the border from mexico to the usa and for the first time in years they are going to relax and stop runningbr br the problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decentmaking them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems while this had a very noble goal at the time it just seems phony today in particular the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didnt ring true it sounded more like antifascism speeches than the voices of real children they were as a result extremely annoyingparticularly the littlest one who came off at times as a brat about the only ones who sounded real were bette davis and her extended american family as well as the scumbag romanian living with them though he had no discernible accentbr br its really tough to believe that the ultrafamous dashiel hammett wrote this dialog as it just doesnt sound true to life the story was based on the play by his lover lillian hellman and the basic story idea and plot is goodbut the dialog is just bad at times overall an interesting curio and a film with some excellent momentsbut thats really about all
4,i was duped into seeing this movie after reading a positive review from another website and man was i pod it took me at least 15 minutes to pick it up off the shelf bc i didnt want anyone to see me then another 10 minutes to build the courage to take it to the counter and actually use real money to rent it i thought that all my stress would pay off by the time i got home to and watching the movie bc the review i read said the movie was a pleasant surprise what a joke if you can make it through the first hour of the movie then your in luck bc its not until then the movie turns into a horror dont bother with this one folks your better off watching dankness falls

1,first and foremost speaking as no fan of the genre the bourne ultimatum is a breathtaking virtuoso superb action moviebr br secondly it is a silly malarky of cartoonish superhero stuffbr br thirdly the film carries a complex important point about crimefighters turning into criminals themselves no reference is made to abu ghraib or the executive branchs outrageous domestic assaults on constitutional rights none is necessarybr br so the latest in the bourne series in the hands of paul greengrass of the 2004 bourne supremacy and last years united 93 is a significant achievement perhaps held back but not actually diminished by the unavoidable excesses of the genrebr br breathtaking above is meant both as a complimentary adjective and a description of the physical sensation for more than an hour from the first frame the viewer seemingly holds his breath pushed back against the chair by the force of relentless globetrotting utterly suspenseful action there is no letup no variation in the rhythm and pull of the film and yet it never becomes monotonous and tiresome the way some kindred music videos do after just a couple of minutesbr br oliver woods inyourface cinematography is making the best of tony gilroys screenplay from robert ludlums 1990 novel which doesnt stack up well against the bourne identity written a decade earlierbr br matt damon is once again the inevitable irreplaceable bourne the deadliest of fantasy cia agents this time taking on the entire agency in search of his identity his past and the mysterious agency program that has turned him into a killing machine nothing like his quietly heroic edward r murrow the alwaysmarvelous david strathairn is the nasty top agency official pitched against bourne in trying to hide some illegal takenoprisoners policies and brutal proceduresbr br joan allen plays what appears to be the good cop against strathairns bad one and there is julia stiles as the agent once again coming to bournes aid a combination of greengrass direction and stiles acting results in a surprising impact by a mostly silent character her lack of communication and blank expression more intriguing than miles of dialoguebr br so good is the bourne ultimatum that it gets away with the old onemanagainsttheworld bit this time stretched to ridiculous excesses as bourne defies constraints of geography time gravity and physics in general can you fly backwards with a car from the top of a building why not  it looks great br br all this realworld magic  leaping from country to country in seconds to arrive at some unknown location exactly as when and how needed  outdoes specialeffect and superhero cartoon improbabilities and yet only a clueless pedant would allow facts interfere with the entertainmentbased ecstasy of the bourne fantasy
0,shame really  very rarely do i watch a film and am left feeling disappointed at the end ive seen quite a few of ira levins adaptations  rosemarys baby and the stepford wives  and liked both them but this just didnt appeal to mebr br when i read the plot outline  an award winning playwright michael caine decides to murder one of his former pupils christopher reeve and steel his script for his own success  i was excited i like thrillers michael caines a good actor sidney lumets a good director and ira levins work is generally goodbr br i wont spoil it for anyone who hasnt seen it yet but all id say is there are loads of twists and turns so many its kind of hard to explain the films plot line in detail without giving it away i enjoyed the first  45 minutes before the twists and turns began to occur and at that point my interest and enjoyment began to fade out though i have to give lumet credit for the very amusing ending which did make me laugh out loudbr br the main cast  michael caine christopher reeve dyan cannon and irene worth  were all brilliant in their roles though worths obvious fake russian accent got on my nerves slightly nothing personal irene i think any actors fake accent would irritate me not sure if cannons character was meant to be annoyingly funny but dyan managed to annoy and amuse  at the same timebr br anyone reading this  i dont want you to be putoff watching this because of my views  give it a chance you may like it you may not its all about opinion
0,legendary movie producer walt disney brought three of the worlds greatest fairy tales to the screen they remain among the most popular animated films of all time the first was his groundbreaking classic snow white and the seven dwarfs released in 1937 the last was the thenunder appreciated sleeping beauty which made its debut in 1959 in between these two was perhaps his most satisfying adaptation of a classic fairy tale cinderella 1950 of the three films cinderella is the one most faithful to its origins ironically unlike snow white which for better or worse became for many the definitive version of the story cinderella did not follow the same path although it was a hit and like snow white was responsible for restoring the dwindling disney fortunes it never achieved the same audience recognition which it certainly deserved disney for once did himself proud electing not to tamper with a classic instead elaborating and adding substance to the tale rather than rewriting it for the screen the result was enchanting br br a combination of superb animation in beautifully soft technicolor and the perfect voice talents brought the story to life with a radiance that endures to this day ilene woods who was a radio performer recorded demonstration discs of the songs as a favor to the authors of the material al hoffman mack david and jerry livingston when disney heard them he knew he had found his cinderella and indeed he had woods heartfelt renditions of a dream is a wish your heart makes so this is love and oh sing sweet nightingale are perfect eleanor audley who would go on to voice maleficent in sleeping beauty masterfully captured the icy cruelty of the stepmother while rhoda williams and lucille bliss were convincingly nasty stepsisters luis van rooten admirably performed as both the king and the grand duke and james macdonald was endearing as both jaq and gus cinderellas devoted mice william phipps has little dialog as the prince future talk show host mike douglas provided his singing voice but film and disney veteran verna felton was born to play the fairy godmother and she made the best number the oscarnominated bibbidibobbidiboo her own showstopper br br among the artists responsible for the look of the film was mary blair whose inspired use of color was greatly admired by disney her elegant frenchperiod backgrounds add tremendously to the quality of the movie but most important of all are the believable charactersfrom cinderella right down to lucifer the stepmothers deliciously evil cat they bring both life and vibrancy to the often told story something very difficult to create in an animated filmbr br in conjunction with the films 55year anniversary and not so coincidentally the coming holiday season cinderella has just been released on a special edition dvd it simply has never looked better the fully restored film must be seen to be appreciatedsuffice it to say it looks wonderful an enhanced stereo soundtrack has been added and serves the music well the dvd extras now a standard part of disney platinum editions are too numerous to list here but as usual some are directed towards children some are slanted to adults and the rest fall somewhere in between but real fans will want to get the deluxe gift set because along with an actual cell from the film and eight character sketches it includes a 160page hardback book which not only incorporates most of the material found in the book with the 1995 special edition home video release but much more as well as usual for disney cinderella will only be available for a limited time so if like me you are a cinderella lover get it now this edition is truly a dream come true

0,return to the 36th chamber is one of those classic kungfu movies which shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of hollywood and the protagonist gordon liu the counterpart to the westerns clint eastwood digitally remastered and a new print made for the fantastic film fest this is presented in shaw scope just like the good old daysbr br this film is a simple story of good versus evil told in acts which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that erabr br act one sets up the premise workers in a dyemill of a small village are unhappy with their lot having their wages cut by 20 by incoming manchu gangsters they cant do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters and their boss at first they had a minor success in getting liu to impersonate a highly skilled shaolin monk one of the best comedy sequences but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many timesbr br act two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob however without real martial arts he embarks on a journey to shaolin temple to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly after some slapstick moments he finally gets accepted by the abbot whom he impersonated but is disappointed at the teaching methods  kinda like mr miyagis style in karate kid but instead of painting fences he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple nothing can keep a good man down and he unwittingly builds strength endurance and learns kungfu the unorthodox waybr br act three is where the fight fest begins with cheesy sound effects each obvious noncontact on film is given the maximum impact treatment but it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners and the use of slowmotion only to showcase stunts in different angles you may find the speed of fights a tad too slow with some pause in between moves but with yuen wo ping and his style being used adnausem in hollywood flicks they sure dont make fight scenes like they used to return to the 36th chamber gets a repeat screening on monday so if youre game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane what are you waiting for
6,this movie was charming an accountant wants more from life than the approved conventional success what makes it work so well and makes it so different from the standard dance movie is that it really isnt about becoming great it is simply about finding a way to express ones self the big triumph at the end is not the winning of a contest not the discovery of a whole new life style but the simple joy of doing what you want to fulfill the other parts of your life no one is discovering their passion they are finding their quiet soulbr br the japanese background makes the subtle oppression and secret life of ballroom dancing both understandable and personal we can all see ourselves in the everyman
6,i hate to even waste the time it takes to write 10 lines on this atrocity hyungrae shim is lucky that bad filmmaking isnt a capital crime or hed be put to death twice for writing and directing this disaster im amazed that this film had a 75m budget but actually glad in the sense that it was such a tremendous flop that shim will hopefully never get to make another movie the rest of the life and therefore not waste any more of filmgoers time i would think the actors would have gotten together and lynched him by nowbr br with the effects resources available to them a great film could have been made with this budget as usual the failure should have been spotted at the very beginning with the terrible script and story transformers was another visual feast with a weak script but this makes it look like citizen kane
3,i rented this film because of my interest in american history and especially the somewhat weird story of the mormons this movie attempts to make some sense out of how joseph smith could turn his vision into a major world religion it first focuses on the troubles the mormons had in their settlement at navuoo illinois it portrays the trial of joseph smith within the course of that trial brigham young stands up to tell of his conversion to mormonism and of his belief in the spiritual message of smith then smith is assassinated and young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the mormons to a new land despite his grave doubts he perseveres and finally has a vision that utah is the place for his colony that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership later as crops are destroyed by crickets he again doubts that he has truly been chosenhowever a miracle occurs which cements his place in historybr br i found the performances to be moving and the story to be convincing and interesting i would love to know whether mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal polygamy is a part of the story but the reasons why this is central to lds are not raised the issue is not emphasizedbr br im sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subjectmatter but it has a great cast and will hold your interest throughout

0,you will recognize the plot immediately daughters of a divorced couple trying to get mom and dad back together again yes that was the theme of the parent trap in the 60s 80s and 90s but heres the spooky thing even though deanna durbin was younger than the 21 year old hayley mills while playing the doting daughters roles durbin looks much older as in adult and so do all of her socalled siblings br br and this confusion between adult and child goes throughout the film the girls are dressed in cute little sailor outfits but look ridiculous in them as the director seems to take pains to point out their ample tops and tushies throughout the film so youre constantly torn between thinking of them as children or women when ray milland and others start hitting on them you get the feeling as if theyre pedophiles and you might be one too for noticing those tushies and tops the director was pointing out teens or temptresses little girls or little foxes you are never quite sure what youre supposed to be thinking of them asbr br the parents too seem very old and the whole film seems very datedbr br it is a rusty version of the parent trap and you should avoid it or at least ensure your tetanus shots are up to date if you dont believe me
1,what a fun movie st ives is it reminds me of the type of film made during the 40s classic story rounded off by characters and a plot that is neither over dramatic nor overtly complicated in fact it isnt over anything robert lewis stevensons story  here adapted for the screen  reads like jane austen for men we do get a tale that has a romance at its heart but there is plenty of fun too battle scenes sort of prison escapes mistaken identities swordplay and the funniest line ive heard in years only in scotland would guests be announced by name at a masked ball there is much hilarity hardship and not a little heartbreak as st ives tries to fight and find his way back to a family and life he barely knewbr br the cast is absolutely stellar with the too infrequently seen jean marc barr absolutely perfect in the title role anna friel is a refreshing delight as the resourceful flora and miranda richardson nearly walks away with the movie as her wise and worldly been there and seenitall aunt susan richard grant provides comic relief of the highest orderbr br this is not going to be the greatest movie anyone has ever seen but its charms are undeniable and the entire film fairly bristles with an energy that bursts with life
1,this is amazinglooking movie with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors when it came out over 15 years ago it stunned audiences with its color scheme being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film those colors for me at least make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch there are literally thousands of scenes i wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artworkbr br the characters and the story dont match up to the greatness of the photography but they are all overthetop especially the villains the famous actors who played them here must have a had a lot of fun on the set playing flatop pruneface lips mumbles etcbr br meanwhile warren beatty and gleanne hedley are good as dick tracey and girlfriend tess truehart and shes as sweet and soft as her name another good addition is charlie korsmo as the delinquent young boy dick and tess take under their wing the colorful other characters are played by al pacino dustin hoffman william forysthe paul sorvino mandy patinkin madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here check the full credits on the main page and youll amazedbr br the only negatives i found were pacinos voice which grates on you after awhile madonnas offkey singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about 10 minutes those faults are all minor because overall this is a fun moviea cartoon strip coming to life in an incrediblycolorful fashionlike nothing you have ever seen
7,kurt russell is at his best as the man who lives off his past glories reno hightower robin williams is his polar opposite in a rare low key performance as jack dundee he dropped the big pass in more ways than onebr br youll see some of the most quotable scenes ever put into one film as jack hisses at a rat reno poses and the call of the caribou goes outbr br dont miss this classic that isnt scared to show football in the mud the way it should be played
6,this indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in connecticut the plot is fairly thin what drives the film is the characters excellently played by mostly unknown actors standouts in the cast are brewster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper the two actresses give natural performances and work well together this is an impressive feature film debut for writer schechter and director setton the latter keeps the narrative moving at a fast clip the film title and poster suggest something raunchy but this is a marvelous little comedydrama
1,the crush is a pleasant enough 40something friends romantic chick flick for the first twothirds or so as it tries to be a brit sex and the city br br i particularly enjoyed the turnaround of the trophy young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out come to think of it we didnt see all that much physical flesh of him either and kenny doughty is worth seeing more of br br they sure make a lot more deal of young manolder woman than was made of the opposite in either version of sabrina neither movie do i like or for that matter with the douglaszetajones or dionsvengali nuptialsbr br surrounding andie macdowell as an ex pat otherwise are welcome familiars from brit dramas and comedies such as tarttongued anna chancellor br br the plot twists towards the end feel very deus ex machina but it wasnt until the credits came up at the end that i realized what might really be wrong just as with sex and the city the writerdirector is male here firsttimer scot john mckay and i think he really wanted to do a script about three gay men probably about them coming out in relation to their lovers and at work the characters are a school principal a cop and a doctor which would have been a better and more interesting movie the working title for the film was the sad fckers club which would have made its parallels with the gay broken hearts club even more obviousbr br originally written 462002
4,being an independent filmmaker and a huge fan of edward d wood jr i purchased this documentary believing that this would finally set the record straight on how gifted and brilliant ed wood actually was br br what i got was a disappointing selfcentered conflictive contradictory compilation of bitter selfaggrandizing hasbeens br br where people do remember ed wood jr do people actually remember the second cousin of the guy with the duct tape who knew someone who was in plan nine from outer space br br it appears as though the very minute there is a renewed interest in ed wood these people come out of the woodwork only to take mean spirited swipes at someone who actually gave them a chance when noone else would after 50 years i would suggest that many of these people should let go of the fact that they didnt get the 75 they were promisedbr br ed wood was a brilliant creative filmmaker who knew how to entertain infact that was all he lived for you may giggle when you see eds films but somehow you are aware that you are laughing with him and not at him br br but i digress back to the film at hand if you are expecting a film about edward d wood jr you wont get it here if you want a film about cranky bitter old actors this is the film for you
7,there is nothing not to like about moonstruck im from a new york italian family and i actually get a little homesick when i watch it the actors  actresses the plot the subplots the humor they were all fantastic it starts a little slow but a lot happens in that two days i fell in love with laboheme because of this movie on my list of favorite movies moonstruck is number its a feel good movie where you leave the theatre humming thats amore or repeating some of your favorite lines old man if you give those dogs another piece of my food ill kick you till youre dead chrissy bring me the big knife whos dead do you love him loretta good because when you do they drive you crazy because they know they can i always put moonstruck on when theres nothing good to watch because it makes me happy
7,i enjoyed this film yet hated it because i wanted to help this guy i am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music businesswho are now still trying to become adultsno more fansgroupiesmoney etcand they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular lifeas they see the new bands etc getting the spotlightit is almost like they have to begin anewthis film is a testament to what a lot of the old rockers from the 70s and 80s are going through nowand thats where i find the film sad and depressingbut it portrays the life of an old rock starabandoned and lostin a believable waythe young girl who arrives at his decrepit home reminds me of hollis maclaren outrageousand she is one lady in a film you will cheer for this film is a must have for folks in their 50s who have seen the rise and fall of bandspeople who knew the members and have watched them hurt as age creeps inand popularity fadesthis is an almost perfect moviesad but in a way positivebecause of the whales a must see
6,i watched the movie the flock because of the casting of gere and danes and because the story synopsis sounded interesting this was one of the worst movies ive seen in a long while and ive seen some turkeys ive never posted online before but this movie was so awful i had to do so i suppose the problems begin begin with the script which was so amateurish its unbelievable the story makes zero sense and the dialogue is so trite its nauseating poor gere he deserves so much better as for the geredanes on screen matchup because of the horrible writing one doesnt believe either character for a single minute ill bet gere wishes he could buy back the negative were such a thing possible its a shame to see talent wasted so badly not to mention i wish i could get my hours back i know what youre thinking how do i really feel
0,on stage tv or in a book the woman in black is an outstanding ghost story other reviewers have already said just about all there is to say about this film but i thought i would add my belated little review too the madefortv movie has a deliberately slow first act which chronicles the main character arthur as he goes about his business as a solicitor in 1920s london i can understand why this might not appeal to all palates nevertheless for me i love this britishstyle of storytelling similar to any of the bbcs ghost story for christmas adaptations of the great mr james work in the second act the ghost story kicks in as arthur is sent to the provinces by his boss to tidy up the affairs of a deceased client the third act relentlessly builds up to a spinetingling conclusion as a londoner i have seen the play i own the book dvdr and have the unabridged audio book on my ipod too what is sure for me the women in black on any medium is a ghost story with few equals it is about time that we had a legitimate region dvd release
5,this is the first of a two part backstory to the conflict between the machines and mankind in the matrix world and it delivers spectacularly by combining observations on mans fear of the unknown and of being usurped with politics extensive religious and historical imagery subverting expected portrayals of parties involved and an at least partially believable and thus terrifying vision of our near future it isnt perfect and some plot points and images are at once obvious and contrived but it has the desired effect and impact and tells a visceral and cautionary talebr br this first part sets the scene  human societies have developed advanced and capable robots mostly humanoid to serve people doing menial unskilled jobs labour construction etc and thus the populace has become lazy and derogatory towards them one robot however rebels and kills his owner stating at his subsequent trial that he simply did not want to die he is destroyed but when the robot masses destruction is ordered to protect humanity many robots rise up in protest with many human sympathisers alongside thembr br the imagery here is exploitative recounting race riots and abuse tiananmen square the holocaust and an overly provocative scene of a robot in a human girls guise getting harried hammered in the head and then shot dead as it pleads im real it lays on the ground clothes and skin torn and breasts hanging out its an obvious and obscene image designed to present human fear towards uncontrolled elements and aggression towards groups based on the actions of individualsbr br anyway this first portion is much like a compressed version of the film i robot but it soon develops into a recognisable matrix backstory as the surviving robot contingent is exiled and congregates in the middle east in the cradle of civilisation as the narrator informs us there the machines regroup and begin to produce new ai and to manufacture mass technology and trade it with human nations we see a commercial for a car that uses the circular energy hover engines that the ships the rebels in the movies use and we see sentinel type robots flying around zero one the name of their city their goods and trade make their economy soar affecting other economies detrimentally and human governments and authorities establish a blockade in response the machines send ambassadors in the form of adam and eve resemblances to a un congress to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the blockade but they are forcibly removed and the scene is set for war in the second partbr br the animation is by studio 4c who work on quite a few of the animatrix and its evocative and visually stimulating rendering different scenes like imagery montages cctv footage and particular scenes of import distinctive and overall presenting the story perfectly the plot may not be an original concept and it may draw on simplistic sheep mentalities and plot models and resort to provocative material for impact but after the tantalising mystery offered by the first film and morpheus vague brief infodumps this is a nice exposition of the cataclysmic events that left the world ravaged and in the hands of the machines that serves as a warning and as a vehicle for many observations and comments on the human condition the development of ai and the importance of harmony and cooperation and the devastating consequences of conflict and prejudice themes expanded on in the movies
5,astronaut steve west alex rebar and his comrades undertake a space mission that sees them flying through the rings of saturn his comrades are killed instantly but it would seem that they are in fact the lucky ones steve returns to earth a constantly oozing mass of humanoid pulp as he turns into a savage killer melting every step of the way he is tracked by his friend dr ted nelson burr debenningbr br this is often so uproariously funny  with enough absurd lines and situations to go around  that its hard for me to believe that the laughs are all unintentional it seems to me to be kind of a goof on lowbudget genre efforts from the 50s and 60s and as such its a marvelously entertaining movie that sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious were even treated to a split screen sequence that doesnt really add anything but is still a gas to watchbr br writer  director william sachs deserves credit for coming up with this ingenious idea his ultraslimy character is a memorable one indeed i think his pacing is a little off some scenes like the one with the elderly couple go on a little long but ultimately he delivers solid schlocky bmovie goods with a degree of panache the climax is especially funbr br arlon obers music is enjoyably shuddery yet also amusingly silly during some moments and willy curtiss cinematography creates some really great shots at times that brings me to rick bakers fantastic and convincing makeup effects which form a highly respectable centerpiece for the movie right down to the ultimate final meltbr br rebar is under the heavy makeup for almost the entire movie sachs also gets my praise for having the movie hit the ground running and does what he has to do well enough debenning makes for a rather oafish and silly hero and ann sweeney isnt so hot either as his wife but myron healey michael alldredge and lisle wilson are fine in support its also worth it to see folk like cheryl rainbeaux smith doing an appreciable topless shot janus blythe of tobe hoopers eaten alive and wes cravens the hills have eyes and even director jonathan demme in a bit partbr br this is a highly entertaining midnight movie with enough gore chills and laughs to rate it as worth catching for lovers of lowgrade scifi  horror everywherebr br 810
5,el mar is a tough stark utterly brilliant brave work of cinematic art director agust villaronga with an adaptation by antoni aloy and biel mesquida of blai bonets novel has created a film that traces the profound effects of war on the minds of children and how that exposure wrecks havoc on adult lives and though the focus is on wars heinous tattoo on children the transference to like effects on soldiers and citizens of adult age is clear this film becomes one of the finest antiwar documents without resorting to pamphleteering the end result has far greater impact because of its inherent story following childrens march toward adulthoodbr br a small group of children are shown in the spanish civil war of spain threatened with blackouts and invasive nighttime slaughtering of citizens ramala nilo mur tur david lozano julia sergi moreno and francisca victoria verger witness the terror of the assassination of men and the revenge that drives one of them to murder and suicide these wideeyed children become adults carrying all of the psychic disease and trauma repressed in their mindsbr br we then encounter the three who survive into adulthood where they are all confined to a tuberculosis sanitarium ramala roger casamajor has survived as a male prostitute protected by his john morell juli mira and has kept his life style private tur bruno bergonzini has become a frail sexually repressed gay male whose cover is his commitment to catholicism and the blur of delusional selfmutilationcrucifixion francisca antnia torrens has become a nun and serves the patients in the sanitarium the three are rejoined by their environment in the sanitarium and slowly each reveals the scars of their childhood experiences with war tur longs for ramalas love ramala longs to be free from his morell and francisca must face her own internal needs covered by her white nuns habitbr br the setting of the sanitarium provides a graphic plane where the thin thread between life and death between lust and love and between devotion and destruction is played out to detail more would destroy the impact of the film on the individual viewer but suffice it to say that graphic sex and full nudity are involved in some of the most stunningly raw footage yet captured on film and the viewer should be prepared to witness every form of brutality imaginable for this viewer these scenes are of utmost importance and director villaronga is to be applauded for his perseverance and bravery in making this story so intense the actors both as children and as adults are splendid roger cassamoor bruno bergonzini and antnia torrens are especially fine in inordinately difficult roles the cinematography by jaime peracaula and the haunting musical score by javier navarrete serve the directors vision a tough film this but one highly recommended to those who are unafraid to face the horrors of war and its aftermath in spanish with english subtitlesbr br grady harp
1,what a waste of time ive tried to sit through sky captain about times and every time within about minutes i start doing something else  anything else its a downright boring movie the acting is terrible the writing dull and obviously a firsttime director because its stiff and i wanted to love it i love scifi the old cliffhangers and i can appreciate the attempt at nods to flash gordon and metropolis but my god what a waste of money i used to work for paramount pictures and i had written sherry lansing in 1993 about using blue screen for screen tests she told me theyd never have an interest or need to do it 10 years later paramount releases this piece of crap sherry was right in 1993 but must have forgotten her own advice when she greenlighted this dog blue screen an effect shot but not an entire movie lets not forget neither jude nor jolie are terrific actors but easy on the eyes paltrows performance reminds me of a high school effort too bad  it couldve worked but only under a skilled director the funny thing is sky captains director will keep getting work even after this dreck its commerce not art
4,its not quite the timeless masterpiece you would hope it would be based on the acclaim it garnered but 1969s midnight cowboy is still a powerhouse showcase for two young actors just bursting into view at the time directed by john schlesinger and written by waldo salt the movie seems to be a product of its time the late 1960s when american films were especially expressionistic but it still casts a spell because the story comes down to themes of loneliness and bonding that resonate no matter what period the films cinematic influence can still be felt in the unspoken emotionalism found in ang lees brokeback mountainbr br the meandering plot follows joe buck a naive young texan who decides to move to manhattan to become a studforhire for rich women full of energy but lacking any savvy he fails miserably but is unwilling to concede defeat despite his dwindling finances he meets a cynical sickly petty thief named ratso rizzo who first sees joe as an easy pawn the two become dependent on one another and rizzo begins to manage joe things come to a head at a psychedelic druginfested party where joe finally lands a paying client meanwhile rizzo becomes sicker and the two set off for florida to seek a better life this is not a story that will appeal to everyone in fact some may still find it repellent that a hustler and a thief are turned into sympathetic figures yet their predicaments feel achingly authenticbr br in his first major role jon voight is ideally cast as he brings out joes paperthin bravado and deepening sexual insecurities as rizzo dustin hoffman successfully upends his clean postcollege image from the graduate and immerses himself in the personal degradation and glimmering hope that act as an oddly compatible counterpoint to joe the honesty of their portrayals is complemented by schlesingers film treatment which vividly captures the squalor of the times square district at the time the director also effectively inserts montages of flashbacks and fantasy sequences to fill in the characters fragile psyches credit also needs to go to salt for not letting the pervasive cynicism overwhelm the pathos of the story the other performances are merely incidental to the journeys of the main characters including brenda vaccaro as the woman joe meets at the party sylvia miles as a blowsy matron john mcgiver as a religious zealot and barnard hughes as a lonely outoftownerbr br the twodisc 2006 dvd package contains a pristine print transfer of the 1994 restoration and informative commentary from producer jerome hellman since unfortunately neither schlesinger nor salt are still living there are three terrific featurettes on the second disc  a lookback documentary after midnight reflections on a classic 35 years later which features comments from hellman hoffman voight and others as well as clips and related archive footage such as voights screen test controversy and acclaim which examines the genesis of the movies initial x rating and public response to the film and a tribute to the director celebrating schlesinger
1,first there is no way the remake can be as good because japanese society is quite different from ours and plays such a major part in this film as explained in the opening narration it adds to the humor as well as warmth of this movie there is slew of different supporting characterspersonalities each does there part in making this movie wonderful this movie is full of comedy that isnt vulgar in anyway like most of todays grossout comedies yet it can still have you laughing out loud the reality is in real life you dont have a choice of who you work with or go to school withetc this movie truly emphasizes that and shows that the natural good in people can overcome petty differences not to mention it makes for a great subplot and much of the humor this is a story about dance that actually has a story and a good one at that there are a few back stories that are not out of place but actually support the main storyline truly a well written film the dancing is great too i happen to be a fan of any movie with dancing of any sort for that aspect however this movie goes beyond any other with dance in the fact that it is a story first and just happens to be written about dancing in japanse society highly recommendedbr br 10 out of 10
7,you cant really go far when the initial story isnt all that great the premise of cyborgs needing blood is just dopeybr br the script is blas the actors dont have much to work with the sets were staged out in the desert to cut costs its a trademark that if the background is the desert then the movie has no budgetbr br lack of budget is okay if theres a story solarbabies and blood of champions are examples of decent work from no  but this movie looks as if they had to scrape their change together just to buy the cameraman a sandwich again forgivable if only the story didnt just plain suckbr br finally this movie commits the biggest crime of all it doesnt finish it simply ends as if its a commercial break away from the rest of the movie but the rest never comes just oddbr br just bad

2,this movie is bufoonery and i loved it the dragon lord jacky chan and his buddy cowboy totally made the movie fun meaningful and just plain silly the movie is a rare blend of a good vs evil fight and somehow the wonders and fun that is growing up long shao ye takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young dragon lord so named because he is the son of a wealthy family and cowboy which include implementing clever elaborate ways to escape studying with the help of the entire household including the tutor competing in rather boyish and idiotically interesting ways to gain the affection of a local girl competing in soccer you will see what i mean and the list goes on somehow they find themselves in the midst of a fight to save the a shipment of valuable antiques and the lives of several peoplebr br the movie has its serious moments but they do not depress but rather inspire the playfulness of the boys are not lost in this exchange but is actually employed against evil what i really loved about this movie is how it ends not the typical confrontation which in itself was awesome but well youll see let me just say it truly captures the spirit of the moviebr br silly witty meaningful and nostalgic great movie
0,i think everyone was quite disappointed with this scifi flick for one thing it was directed by tim burton another thing its a remake of what is supposed to be a classic i found it boring gross and ridiculous if youve seen it you know what i mean just about everyone at imdb say its crap and boy are they right if you havent avoid it its a snorer out of 10
2,one of the joys of picking up the recent bela lugosi collection is getting to see delightful movies like the invisible ray boris karloff and bela lugosi team up in a movie that delves into meteorites and radiation and while the science is all perfectly absurd especially the camera technique karloff as janos rukh uses to determine the site of a certain meteorite and downright laughable i didnt care in the lease because the movie is thoroughly enjoyable the effects are done well for the time the acting is great and the finish is particularly strong it reminds me of the pulp scifi comics and novels of the 1940s and 50s complete with ray guns and ridiculous science you must watch this movie
0,lars von triers europa is a worthy echo of the third man about an american coming to postworld war ii europe and finds himself entangled in a dangerous mysterybr br jeanmarc barr plays leopold kessler a germanamerican who refused to join the us army during the war arrives in frankfurt as soon as the war is over to work with his uncle as a sleeping car conductor on the zentropa railway what he doesnt know is the war is still secretly going on with an underground terrorist group called the werewolves who target american allies leopold is strongly against taking any sides but is drawn in and seduced by katharina hartmann barbara sukowa the femme fatale daughter of the owner of the railway company her father was a nazi sympathizer but is pardoned by the american colonel harris eddie considine because he can help get the german transportation system up and running again the colonel soon enlists or forces leopold to be a spy without giving him a choice or chance to think about it to see if the werewolves might carry out attacks on the trainsbr br soon leopold is stuck in an adventure by being involved with both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and film noirish way where everyone and everything is not what it seems its amazing to watch the naive leopold deal with everything his lover the terrorists the colonel annoying passengers his disgruntled uncle even the railway companys officials who come to examine his work ethic before he finally boils over and humorously and violently takes control the film is endlessly unpredictablebr br the film stylishly shot it always takes place at night during the winter with lots of falling snow its shot in black and white with shots of color randomly appearing throughout also background screens displaying images that counter act with the images up front add max von sydows hypnotic narration and europa becomes a dreamlike place thats out of this worldbr br this is now a personal favorite film of mine
1,kid found as a baby in the garbage and raised at a martial arts academy has a knack for sinking baskets with the help of the man who found him he gets in to college and is promoted to the championship as he searches for his real parents infinitely better in pieces action comedy is a real mess as a whole it seems to be striving for a hipper basketball version of shaolin soccer but the comedy is scatter shot its focus wanders more than a chihuahua with add on quadruple espresso i kept asking what am i watching i watched it from start to finish and i still dont know what the hell happened its a shame since there are some great action scenes some amusing jokes and the occasional moment but nothing none of it ever comes together id take a pass
4,joel schumaker directs the script he cowrote and has a group of georgetown grads confronted with adult life situations the story line is a scrambled mess but some scenes are actually good there is a lot of wasted talent and time here the cast is more impressive than the movie featured are demi moore rob lowe judd nelson andrew mccarthy emilio estevez ally sheedy and mare winningham the most notable being mccarthy and moore lowe is quite obnoxious coming of age is not so damn easy
0,or listening to for that matter even the soundtrack is a bore br br honestly this isnt the worst gay movie ive seen that would be regarding billy but its down there very close to the bottom of the barrelbr br this thing drags and drags and drags its not that the plot is inanein the hands of a good writer it might have worked    it certainly could have been much more entertaining theres not one plot point you cant see coming for ten miles down the road the dialog is flat the jokes are old to add insult to injury its full of onedimensional stereotypical gays br br nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or the relationship of the two leads was possible much less real there was no chemistry no dynamic in fact no evidence of why the leads love each other    were just told theyre in love hard to figure when they have nothing in common and arent compatible sexually they like the same book huhbr br the acting is not totally bad but the pacing is excruciatingly slow i mean almost jarmusch slow but without jarmusch quality in fact that would be a good barometer for you if you like jarmusch films avoid this one
4,a toothsome little potboiler whose 65minute length doesnt seem a second too short my name is julia ross harks back to an english tradition of things not being what they seem  hitchcocks the lady vanishes is one example outofwork julia ross nina foch finds a dream job at a new employment agency in london whose sinister representative seems very anxious to ascertain if she has living relatives or a boyfriend after reporting to duty she wakes up having been drugged in a vast manderleylike pile on the cornish coast supposedly as the barmyinthecrumpet wife of george macready who displays an alarming interest in knives and ice picks his doting enabling mum is the irresistible dame may whitty this time a model of bustling efficiency on the other side of goodvsevil than she occupied in the lady vanishes the nightmare vision of this tale unfolds claustrophobically we know whats going on but are powerless to tell poor julia this movie curiously is regularly accorded a place of honor as one of the earliest and very few british films noirs i think its closer to the gothic olddarkhouse tradition than the american one of wet cobblestones and urban corruption it does however evince a more modern psychoanalytic cast of mind whatever you call it it remains a sharply satisfying thriller
3,rented a batch of films from blockbuster last night and this was the first one i watched it was late on a saturday night wanted a horror film fixbr br wow this was awful almost embarrassingly so stupid slashertype story i really thought films like scream had put an end to amateur actors delivering clichd and insipid dialogue that is hard to believe was actually typed and read off a page and gore scenes that are nothing to get excited about especially when occurring in a film this poorly scriptedbr br but ive always believed no film is 100 percent totally worthless heres the few good things i can say about this mess br br bobbie phillips love this actress shes the only member of the cast who displays any acting talent whatsoever the only reason i took a chance on renting this is because her name was on the front cover she acquits her presence in this dreck with professionalism even though she looks bemused at times that shes acting in such a moronic storybr br unintentional hilarity this is the kind of film i can remember seeing back when there were still grind house theaters around the country and they used to include crap like this as the third movie on a triplebill with some prestige thriller movie that was finally making its way to the hinterlands unfortunately in this directtovideo age most viewers have to endure these turkeys alone now without the communal experience of being part of an audience jeering and throwing stuff at the screen because the film is so terrible which leads tobr br porn stars trying to act mostly on hand because the producers dont need to cajole or plead with them to disrobe for extended sex scenes but this tradeoff usually means they actually get to speak some lines that are supposed to advance a story other than ooh yeah baby or harder and proudly they all deliver expertly at looking foolish when trying to act id almost exclude ginger lynn allen from this group if her character wasnt supposed to be an irish mom and shes actually attempting at times to do an accent which just keeps the smiles comingbr br its nice to look for the positive in all experiences and thats what i took from this cesspool aka evil breed
0,spoilers included this film surely is the best amicus production ive seen so far even though i still have quite a few to check out the house that dripped blood is a horroromnibusan anthology that contains four uncanny stories involving the tenants of a vicious hellish house in the british countryside a common mistake in productions like this is wasting too much energy on the wraparound story that connects the separate talespeter duffels film wisely doesnt pay too much attention to that it simply handles about a scotland yard inspector who comes to the house to investigate the disappearance of the last tenant and like that he learns about the bizarre events that took place there before all four stories in this film are of high qualitylevel and together they make a perfect wholesome high expectations are allowed for this film since it was entirely written by robert bloch yes the same bloch who wrote the novel that resulted in the brilliant horror milestone psycho were also marking peter duffels solid and very professional debut as a director br br the four stories  chapters if you will  in the house that dripped blood contain a good diversity in topics but theyre almost equally chilling and eerie number one handles about a horrorauthor who comes to the house along with his wife in order to find inspiration for his new book this starts out real well but after a short while his haunted and stalked by the villain of his own imagination the idea in this tale isnt exactly originalbut its very suspenseful and the climax is rather surprising the second story stars hammer horrorlegend peter cushing as a retired stockbroker still haunted by the image of an unreachable and longlost love he bumps into a wax statue that looks exactly like her cushing is a joy to observe as always and  even though the topic of wax museums isnt new  this story looks overall fresh and innovating this chapter also contains a couple of delightful shockmoments and theres a constant tense atmosphere its a terrific warmup for what is arguably the best story number another legendary actor in this one as christopher lee gives away a flawless portrayal of a terrified father hes very severe and strict regarding his young daughter and he keeps her in isolation for the outside world not without reason since the little girl shows a bizarre fascination for witchcraft and voodoo besides great acting by lee and the remarkable performance of chloe franks as the spooky kid this story also has a terrific gothic atmosphere the devilish undertones in this story along with the creepy sound effects of thunder make this story a must for fans of authentic horror the fourth and final story in which a vain horror actor gets controlled by the vampirecloak he wears is slightly weaker then the others when it comes to tension and credibility but that the overload of subtle humor more or less compensates that theres even a little room for parody in this story as the protagonist refers to costar christopher lee in the dracula series most memorable element in this last chapter is the presence of the gorgeous ingrid pitt the cultqueen from the vampire lovers certainly is one of the many highlights in the filmher cleavage in particular br br no doubt about itthe house that dripped blood will be greatly appreciated by classic horror fans i truly believe that with a bit of moodsettling preparations this could actually be one of the few movies thatll terrify you and leave a big impression intelligent and compelling horror like it should be highly recommended one extra little remark though this film may notrepeat may not under any circumstances be confused with the dorm that dripped blood this latter one is a very irritating and lousy underground 80s slasher that has got nothing in common with this film except for the title it stole
1,spoilers im always surprised at how many people gave this game good reviews it was awful the script and voice acting alone ruined it gabriel and grace are the most unlikeable characters in the game you almost pray for their deaths and worst of all there are less vampires in this game than there were werewolves in the beast withinbr br the lack of real vampires was incredibly disappointing if youre expecting some kind of anne rice style vampire story forget it this games story has very little to do with vampires you wont even see any till about the very end and even then you wont get to fight thembr br the story has radical and pretty much blasphemous views of christianity im amazed it got off the drawing board im not even christian and i found it offensive mostly the story centers around a search for the holy grail and buried treasure the kidnapping of a royal baby which should have been the focus really gets pushed aside there is no sense of urgency for gabriel to find the baby in fact he almost never asks anyone about the baby after the first few time blocksbr br the graphics are pretty bad the characters move about at a snails pace even on the best of systems they are chunky and outdated and its hard to go from the fmv of the beast within to this horrible game engine for blood of the sacredbr br the relationship between gabriel and grace takes an awful turn too i really dont know why it was so horribly rushed but they do sleep together and its not fun gabriel spends most of the game telling his best friend mosely how he thinks of grace as more of a sister and he doesnt think shes the one for him and he seems really grossed out that they slept together but hes so unlikeable throughout the game that you almost dont even care at that point his dialogue was the worst in the game and he was constantly making stupid sexual innuendos at anything female the entire game by the end of the game grace leaves him with what appears to be a dear john letter i guess she was as fed up with him as most of the players werebr br i found the story to be annoying and boring i was expecting to play a story of a royal baby who was kidnapped by vampires and i was expecting to get to see and fight vampires maybe even have gabriel or grace turn into one but no instead the story focused on the authors warped vision of christianity what a shame here they had the elements for a great adventure and instead we got thisbr br for me the only interesting parts of the game were actually at the very end we do get a few action style puzzles at the end but it wasnt worth suffering through the entire game to get to thembr br i cant really recommend this game i had gotten it back when it came out years ago and i hated the game engine so much that i shelved it for years i only recently dusted it off to see what id been missing and now im very sorry that i did my favorite characters were ruined i hope there will be a fourth game just to redeem the series and i hope they get it right next time it would be a terrible shame to end the series with this installment
3,this movie has a lot of comedy not dark and gordon liu shines in this one he displays his comical side and it was really weird seeing him get beat up his training is unorthodox and who wouldve thought knot tying could be so deadly lots of great stunts and choreography very creativebr br add johnny wang in the mix and youve got an awesome final showdown dont mess with manchu thugs theyre ruthless
1,i sat down to watch midnight cowboy thinking it would be another overrated 60s70s movie some of my favorite films come from the 70s in the same vein as midnight cowboy taxi driver mean streets panic in needle park etc but there are many many overrated ones as well that have gained strong reputations amongst critics for being groundbreaking  unfortunately a vast majority of them dont hold up as well today i sort of feel this way about easy rider although it too is one of my favoritesbr br so i didnt expect much from midnight cowboy but got a lot back its a touching story wellmade and welltold with some of the best performances of all time dustin hoffman as enrico ratso rizzo gives one of his best  its a bit funny at times he sounds like a cartoon character when he speaks  maybe because of the lennysimpsons connection but hoffman is entirely convincing half of the films budget went towards his paycheck as he was just becoming a major star in hollywood opposite him is the secondbilled jon voight as joe buck the cowboy who travels north to the big apple in the hopes of becoming a male prostitute soon his naive ways land him in trouble and he pairs up with a crippled scam artist named ratso  who offers to become joes manager for a certain percentage of profitsbr br the movie is quite long at two hours but never really seems very long some films can tend to drag especially some of the films that were made in the 70s because as its been said in easy riders raging bulls the directors were the stars of the movies in the 1970s and occasionally they got a bit too infatuated with their material going on too long examining charactersscenesetc that arent important just about the only scene i felt was a bit too long and unnecessary was the drug party  it makes the film seem extremely outdated similar to the drug odysseys in easy rider and really harms its flow because its not neededbr br other than that midnight cowboy is an almost flawless motion picture i was pleasantly surprised it does have its flaws flashbacks are a bit tacky and never used as well as they could have been for instance and some of the scenes are a bit uneasy such as the gay movie theater sequence but if you can handle its content midnight cowboy is a truly great motion picture an uncompromising examination of life on the streets in the late 60searly 70s its a depressing movie yes and by todays standards might seem a bit outdated and heavy on the liberal perspective of life is horrible etcbut i still love it and particularly the extremely touching ending will stay with me for a long long timebr br highly recommended one of the best films of the 70s it was technically released in late 1969 but id still categorize it as a 1970s film it also won the best picture oscar being the first  and only  xrated motion picture to do so it was later rerated r on appealbr br 455
6,i notice the dvd version seems to have missing scenes or lines between the posting of the frf and the launch br br they are to prove they can win the right to sit in the frf other than the green teambr br another scene is like during their failure at the simulation kevin gets joaquin to clam downbr br i think the vhs edition other than the abc one might have all the missing stuffbr br otherwise i like to know which dvd release has the missing stuffbr br the dvd i have watched feels edited for television
0,ok i didnt have high expectations but this film descending into depths i could not imaginebr br the plot as it were involved a priest of an obscure member order investigating the death of the founder of the order by a sin eater the sin eater allows for catholics to achive salvation outside the authority of the church and is yet another immortal in film with loads of ennui nevermind that this makes no sense since then a baptist could give you salvationwell move onbr br ill layout the plot wo giving much away the priest goes to rome with his buddy to investogate he brings with him a mental patient im not making this up who shot him during an excorism and who loves him not one lick of this btw is explained a drunk irish priest and peter weller as a cardinal they get to rome find some creepy kids who do nothing in the film meet with a bondage gear sm antipope that the drunk irish guy knows not explained and who gives information by killing people oh btw hes a bad guy so he has an industrialtechno soundtrack and thenumm seriously im not sure the plot meanders about heath chills with the sin eater flies to new york with the sin eater for an overnighter and then some other stuff happens and then all off camera the antipope falls and the film endsbr br about hour into the film one really wonder if anything has happened by the end something has happened but you cant be at all certain that it matters and since most of the drama takes place either before the movei or offscren youre really feeling cheated
0,i am surprised than many viewers hold more respect for the sequel to this brilliant movie i have seen all the guinea pigs and this one is easily the bestbr br even though ive seen the making of i still have doubts when watching those 35mins of pure torture  its that powerfulbr br a 10 out of 10 because this movie achieved perfectly what it set out to do  be the best fake snuff film ever made
2,from its uninspiring title to the flat acting performances curdled is very much an unremarkable film throughout the film has gained some fans by way of the fact that quentin tarantinos name is attached to it and the silly and out of place nod to the rodrigueztarantino flick from dusk till dawn these things do not make a great movie however and this is more than evident all the way through curdled the film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas and it tries to mask this with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are supposed to be disturbing the mexican music score that accompanies many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cool but its becomes annoying very quickly especially as aside from the fact that the lead character is mexican it doesnt fit with the tone of the movie the films plot is typically offbeat and it follows a gorehound who because of her obsession with grisly murders takes a job with a firm that cleans up murder scenes it sounds boring and it isbr br william baldwin is the only name on the cast list and even he doesnt make an impression he hasnt been given anything to do in the movie and aside from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look menacing hes pretty much wasted angela jones or rather the taxi driver from pulp fiction takes the lead role as the murder obsessed young woman and it is always clear that its her involvement with pulp fiction that won her this role not her acting ability she may have been good enough in her small role in tarantinos masterpiece but she doesnt have the talent to lead a film by herself she looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film and if it werent for her latino accent she wouldnt convince the audience that shes a weirdo on any level curdled is a one hundred percentproof piece of forgettable trash films like this often win themselves praise for invention or black comedic antics but this one fails on all levels whether youre a tarantino fan william baldwin fan horror fan or just a movie buff this is one to miss
0,ive never been huge on imax films theyre cool but once you get over that initial rush of whoa it feels like flying the movies themselves are usually pretty corny and ordinary br br the exceptions have been the powerful everest the exhilarating wild california and now the bbcs the human body a supersized look at the insides of our bodies br br our bodies are machines of a complexity that is simply inconceivable this 50 minute film could be 10 hours long and still wouldnt get to all of the systems working in tandem just as i type this review and listen to my radio and most of us take it all for granted br br here you can see the inside of a pumping heart looks like an alien spaceship the inside of your lungs the tiny hairs in your eardrum that process sound the development of a baby inside a mothers womb and surprisingly a few of theum less attractive functions that i thought it would shy away from pimples the churning of acids in the stomachbr br this film also has a rather funky style to it which sets it apart from other imax documentaries for instance weve all seen sperm finding its way to the egg but have you ever seen it set to the tune of marvin gayes lets get it on its creative moments like that that make the human body not just a health lesson but fun as well
1,i saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed its so bad that it is actually funny in a very cringe worthy waybr br gael is absolutely terrible i mean he just cannot act period he should give up now as acting is clearly not his thing his costars are about the same caliber im sure my year old cousin could do a better job than all of them the director should be ashamed to have put his name on something so ridiculous somehow i dont think an oscar is on the cards for this guybr br i have never written a comment on imdb but this movie was so bad i felt compelled to do sobr br if you get the chance to see this film dont 010 if there was a
6,this movie was bad beyond belief i saw it during the 2004 san francisco film festival before it started the owner of the theatre got up and told us how half the audience had left the theatre the night before which happened to be its world premiere i dont think anyone in the theatre understood just how bad the movie was going to be at that point we all understood by the end br br its not a documentary though it was sort of sold as one dark angel was a bad biography and misguided homage to bettie paige in which half the movie is actually just remakes of old bettie paige movies the movie is only 90 minutes long and the content of those 90 minutes is sub par to say the least a scene would start going then someone would say wow youre so great bettie why dont we make another movie this would be followed by a minutes of a bettie paige remake which was almost as ridiculous as and even more boring than the normal part of the movie by the end of the movie people were laughing every time another bettie paige movie remake came up it was that ludicrous i heard a lot of laughter in that theatre but people were not laughing with the movie maker they were laughing at the movie and its poor content and structure this was easy to tell as the parts that would get the most laughs were the ones which were supposed to be serious or revelatory br br i know movies are expensive i have seen many cheaply made independent films but somehow the cinematography and quality of this movie set it apart from anything else i have ever seen the movie looks like it was made for 12 the cuts the graininess and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience this movie makes dude wheres my car look like citizen kane br br my friends and i left the theatre feeling like we had just paid dollars to be tortured the only redeeming part of the experience was that we got to laugh about the fact that someone had actually made this movie and thought it was good apparently the previous night the night of the world premiere the directorwriterproducer had been in the audience and had gotten to witness people laugh at and walk out on his movie bettie paiges movies were destroyed they should destroy this movie too
3,this movie is brilliant in every way it touches on the complexities of loving relationships in a meaningful way but never lectures the script never condescends toward any character not even the hapless johnny it also and benefits from spoton direction production design casting and performances the fact that cher is so perfect in the film and is more unlike cher than she has ever been is a wonder to me i watch moonstruck at least once a year and i just viewed it again this christmas eve with my 16 year old twin daughters and they loved it as well it has something for everyone with a heart and leaves you filled with joy in the end
4,you know youre in trouble when the film your watching has numerous alternate titles generally it means that they tried and retried to hide the turkey in various markets such a turkey is the brain machine which has seven different titlesbr br its about some super secret government project that is suppose to be able to use a computer to read people but instead it drives people to kill each other or themselves or something like that its filled with b level tv actors sitting in paneled room with lawn chairs trying to act a script that makes almost no sensebr br its a turkey of the untastey kind avoid it
7,when it comes to horror movies i am more than willing to suspend disbelief ignore subpar production values and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare this movies simply has no good scares to offer it cant even be enjoyed as camp bad dialogue bad acting bad direction the kills were predictable and poorly staged the music was annoying the camera work was wretched even the costumes were bad i felt really bad for the actors who were obviously trying but who had to deal with terrible contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction i doubt they got any rehearsal either its embarrassing to watch and so boring than making it through to the contrived surprise ending requires tremendous endurance its quite easily one of the worst movies ive ever seenbr br i dont normally write reviews but this one was so bad that i felt compelled to warn others this movie is a complete waste of time if you must watch this movie dont miss the making offeaturette the writerdirector seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold daring move seen it he and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if its a newage citizen kane its like listening to a group of thirdgraders take you behind the scenes of their christmas pageant they truly think theyve created something of substance its sad really the only reason i gave this movie a is because i think should be reserved for true atrocities like manos hands of fate and space mutiny so american nightmare isnt the worst movie ive ever seen but id have to say that its somewhere in the bottom fifty
3,this movie is a bad to alright rip off of friday the 13th the movie is about a killer named bernie who kills people around a camp councilor training camp he kills people because the camp councilor training camp is on land that was owned by his father and when the police came to forcefully take his fathers land they accidentally killed his mother another f13th take off the intro is seeing bernie killing his first victims then we are introduced to a family going camping in the same woods soon after they arrive they are joined by a strange old man who likes talking about his son later we learn that his son is bernie and that he has him locked up in the back of his caravan after having broken him out of a mental institute he sets bernie after the family so they can take their stuff and then the chase is onbr br this movie is only recommended to those who enjoy b grade 80s slashers
2,monika mitchells showbiz satire has some laughs and some premeditated violence i wouldnt say bloodsoaked but there is insult and injury max matteojohn cassiniis a character actor that has a quirky adaptable presence on screen but he has a terrible track record of being chosen for the parts he goes after there is always a producers nephew or seemingly trivial reason for his not being awarded the role he seeks well the best thing to do is get rid of the competitionmax becomes obsessed with such thoughts the rewarding career is just a swing push and shot away other cast members rene rivera molly parker jennifer beals frank cassini and cameos by eric roberts and sandra oh well thats show businessor is it
2,verhoevens movie was utter and complete garbage hes a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed by his own admission he read chapters of the book got bored and decided to make the whole thing up from scratchbr br heinlein would have never supported that trash if hed been alive to see it it basically steals the name mocks politics of the book which is a good portion of it and throws in some ta so the average idiot american moviegoer doesnt get boredbr br this anime isnt perfect but its at least mostly accurate as best i can tell
0,there are so many incorrect statements in this socalled documentary that i found myself shouting at the televisionbr br bart sibrel might be able to produce a flashy looking dvd but he is sadly lacking at looking at the science behind his claimsbr br he relies on either being inaccurate not telling the full story or the old favourite government always lies to us innuendos and people believing what is told to them and not checking on the accuracy or details behind the claimsbr br whats more his exclusive or unreleased footage is freely available over the internet from various sitesbr br further reading about the circumstances regarding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses to gain interviews and has used creative editing of the responses in order to promote his own opinionsbr br all of the claims made by mr sibrel about inaccuracies mistakes or whistleblowing in the apollo programme have been thoroughly disprovenbr br how do i get that 40odd minutes of my life back
7,i knew absolutely nothing about chocolat before my viewing of it i didnt know anything about the story the cast the director or anything about the films history all i knew was it was a highlyacclaimed french film had i known more i probably wouldnt have viewed the picture with an open mind on paper the premise doesnt sound interesting to me had i known what chocolat was about ahead of time my interest while watching would have been limited however not knowing about the story helped me enjoy it throughout i had no clue has to where the story would go what the characters would do and what the end result would be it was if nothing else not a predictable film indeed it could have been as the story is told in flashbacks telling a story in flashbacks is often a risky move on the part of the filmmakers since the lead character is seen in present day the audience knows she will remain alive by using the flashback technique director claire denis is able to ensure the audience that the young girl makes it to adulthood without any serious physical damage giving the viewer the sense that chocolat is a story more about emotions than what is on the outside a lesser filmmaker would give france a haggardlooking face one that screams of a confused and unusual childhood instead denis presents france as a beautiful girl someone who looks fine on the outside br br it could be argued that chocolat is more about frances mother since she is given far more screen time though i believe it is ultimately about france to me what chocolat is really about is how a mothers actions affect her daughter it is about how parents behavior stays with their offspring france is not ruined by her mothers actions in the story yet her mothers actions clearly made an impression on france had france not been affected at all by her mothers actions the flashback aspect would be irrelevant br br for a movie that deals with two time periods the past and the present chocolat was a very well paced there were no scene of excess fat none of the scenes felt gratuitous or out of the place the film had nice rhythm the editing crisp leaving only what was necessary to tell the story with a well told story solid editing and organized directing chocolat is one of the better french films i have seen it was responsible for launching claire denis career and with good reason its an incredible directorial debut
0,the movie itself is not too bad many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script but it is watchable what really gives me the creeps though is that people like justin timberlake even get cast for movies and on top of that for movies like this one i have to admit i had never heard the mans name before watching this but the very instant he appeared i was just plain annoyed the voice is crap the face is a bad ripoff of legolas the posture is horrible and he cannot even properly coordinate all three of them said to say i was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco because i was hoping from then on it would be morgan freeman and kevin spacey only too bad i was wrong these two and also ll cool j give a very decent performance and they are the main reason i give this a br br i see many upcoming movies with the little timberlake cast and cannot believe it
6,i absolutely loved this soap it has been one of my favorite will highly recommend  i just love brazilian soaps they deal with real life events im really sad that the soap ended but im sure ill be able to find it somewhere for those of you who have not seen it please see it i loved the characters the plot and how things turned out in the end for the villains the only thing i would have changed is the end for xica and her long life love i cant wait to see it again and highly recommend it xica has been by far the best soap i have ever seen forget everything else go xica hope you all like it as well
0,this movie struck home for me being 29 i remember the 80s and my father working in a factory i figured if i worked hard too if i had pride and never gave up i too could have the american dream the house a few kids a car all to call my own ive noted however without a degree in something unlike my father that quit at ninth grade and a keen sense of greed and laziness you cant get anywherebr br i would like to know if anyone has this movie on dvd or vhs its made for tv and i just saw it an hour ago ic ant find it anywhere id love to show this to my friends my pseudo friends family and other relatives see what they think and remind them that once upon a time americans would work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished i think the feeling is still there but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas
1,by rights there should never have been a first blood part ii the original script for first blood had john rambo committing suicide at the end of the film but this was changed to allow him to live not because the producers wanted to make a sequel but because test audiences found the original ending too depressing nevertheless someone obviously thought that the character was too good to waste because he ended up as the hero of two more films in the eighties plus the recently released fourth instalmentbr br the official title of this film was rambo first blood part ii but it is more commonly known simply as rambo it starts with the title character in jail where he is presumably expiating the crimes he committed in first blood although this is never made too explicit he is removed from prison by his former commanding officer colonel trautman for a secret mission rambo is to return to vietnam to investigate reports that american pows are still being held captive by the communist regime he is under strict instructions not to attempt to rescue any prisoners or to engage the enemy his is to be simply a factfinding missionbr br what rambo does not realise is that he is being set up not by trautman who is portrayed as brave honourable and incorruptible but by the organiser of the mission a military bureaucrat named murdock murdock intends that the mission will prove that there are no american prisoners in vietnam partly because that will improve relationships between the american and vietnamese governments partly because it will make his own life easier unfortunately for murdock rambo discovers that not only are americans still being held prisoner they are also being kept in hellish conditions of course he is far too much of a hero to leave them to their fate and tries to rescue them the rest of the film is more or less one long battle between rambo and a few allies including a beautiful vietnamese girl and the evil commie soldiers and their russian allies most of the evil commies of course end up dead although i was surprised to learn from your trivia section that the total death toll was as low as 67 at times it seemed as though rambo was trying to wipe out the entire vietnamese armybr br the tone of this film is very different from the first in first blood rambo was unquestionably a criminal even though his responsibility for his crimes was lessened by severe provocation and by his mental instability in rambo he is a bona fide allamerican hero a few years earlier the director george pan cosmatos had made the cassandra crossing a biased piece of leftwing antiamerican propaganda cosmatos however was nothing if not versatile and rambo proves that he could also turn his hand to biased rightwing proamerican propaganda the one thing the two films have in common is that both are laughably badbr br first blood had its faults but it also had its virtues its stance that the antiwar movement was partly to blame for the problems faced by vietnam vets in readjusting to civilian life was a controversial one but at least the film was trying to make a statement about war social attitudes to war and the roots of violence in society rambo by contrast has very few virtues except that the action sequences are well enough done to please those who like that sort of thing it is essentially a sort of jingoistic revenge fantasy for those americans who were still sore about the vietnam war rambo refights the war singlehanded and this time the right side wins take that charlie cong br br by this point no doubt the films admirers and there seem to be plenty more than 2000 voters have already given it ten stars will have concluded that i am a liberal commieloving pinko far from it in fact i have always despised communism as a pernicious ideology what i dislike about the film is not its politics but its lack of subtlety and its suggestion that the solution to all problems including ideological disputes is to go in with all guns blazing and to try and kill as many people as possible it makes no attempt to understand the political complexities of southeast asia or why not everyone in the region was proamerican for all its anticommunism the film is the sort of moronic sledgehammer propaganda that the communists were very good at churning out themselves except that they attributed all the worlds problems to capitalism or imperialism or revisionism or whatever other ism they had taken a dislike to compared to rambo the green berets was a masterly piece of political analysis 310
0,life in some future fascist or near fascist state which severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurrent theme both in modern literature and for film makers such works post us warnings about undesirable trends in our society to watch out for but to be effective they must also be entertaining unfortunately most of the books are probably more effective in posting the warnings than in entertaining us enough to become really widely read whilst with the films the problem is usually the other way round the first such work to become really widely known was probably george orwells 1984 first published in 1948 and this is still readily available both in the form of a book and as a filmbr br watch or read it and then when you are feeling a little depressed by mans inhumanity to man reach for cinderella 2000 this is a feather light low budget film comedy based on the same theme which provides effortless but unrewarding viewing and as with 1984 the calendar has now passed beyond its erstwhile period most of the comedy is laid on with a trowel although there are just a few genuinely funny moments to exercise your mind in the long intervals between these you can focus it on the question of whether this film will gain a new extension of life by being released as a dvd or whether it will finally disappear into oblivion as existing tape copies deteriorate past redemption there are many worse films appearing as dvds these days and frankly i do not care much what happens either waybr br so far the best of the films of this genre has probably been the handmaidens tale but i would very happily swap them all for a well made film of jack londons towering novel the iron heel ambitious as this would be it still seems incredible that no modern film maker has yet dared to attempt it imdb only lists a bw silent version made in russia in 1919
1,first and foremost zorie barber zeke might be one of the worst actors i have ever seen as a character thats supposed to be a hip village writer into the martial arts and proud of being mysterious why is he so hyper overdramatic and plain horrible did he know anything about his character before they started filming did the director dont the martial arts teach discipline aside from that this film misses the target with its lame jokes and seenitalready grossout humor hand in toilet itrainspottingi masturbation hmm ifast times at ridgemont highi iamerican piei the list goes on bad dialogue in one sequence eric says its none of my business ibuti   and 30 seconds later mia says why is this any of your business bad editing at least five minutes worth of film are wasted on nyc traffic shots hrits also impossible to believe that the four main male characters would be a tightknit group of friends in any world i cant comment on what makes everyone laugh but if you enjoy lowbrow basic bathroom humor and insults by all means enjoy if you want something a little smarter but on the same lines see iboomerangi if you want a solid whatgoesaround romantic comedy go for ithe tao of stevei but anyone who thinks iwhippedi is witty and an accurate portrayal dating well i cannot agree at all
6,oscar wildes comedy of manners perhaps the wittiest play ever written is all but wrecked at the hands of a secondrate cast sanders is as one would expect casually indolently brilliant in the role of lord darlington but the rest of the cast makes the entire procedure a waste of time jean crain attempts a stage accent in alternate sentences and the other members of the cast seem to believe this is a melodrama and not a comedy indeed the entire production has bookends that reduce it to tragedy  doubtless the hays office insisted premingers direction seems to lie mostly in making sure that there are plenty of servants about and even the music seems banal stick with the visually perfect silent farce as directed by lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with helen hunt as mrs erlynne or try reading the play for the pleasure of the words but skip this version
0,saw this film in august at the 27th annual national association of black journalists convention in milwaukee wi its first public screening the film is great derek luke is wonderful as antwone fisher this young actor has a very bright future the real antwone fisher did a great job writing the film and denzels direction is right on the money see it opening weekend you wont be disappointed
6,this movie had so much potential anyone who followed the story of jeffrey knows that there are so many details overlooked in this movie its ridiculous too much time and effort was spent in the movie on dahmers homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption where was the character development the origins of any villain are always interesting and dahmer was no exception where in the movie does it address his adolescence when he began killing and mutilating small animals instead we are giving a dizzying array of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer but fail to address the major point in dahmers development also the reason why the country became so intrigued with this story was the details  how he stored the bodies in his apartment and the lengths and measures he went to to accomplish this his cannibalism and his desire for flesh etc i could go on but to sum up too many lagging points in the film focused on his sexuality and not enough of the gore  the good stuff you would expect to see when the title of the movie is dahmer
2,modern viewers know this little film primarily as the model for the remake the money pit older viewers today watch it with wisps of nostalgia cary grant myrna loy and melvyn douglas were all superstars in an easier less complicated era or was it time of course has a way of modifying perspectives and with so many films today verily ulcerating with social and political commentary there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older seemingly less provocative films in mr blandings builds his dream house there may therefore be more than what audiences were looking for in 1948 there is political commentary however subtle finding a house in the late 40s was a truly exasperating experience only lightly softened by the coming of levittowns and the like politics in the movie the blandings children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them in school which in real life would get teachers accused of communism in real life too myrna loy was a housing activist a democrat and a feminist melvyn douglas was no less a democratic firebrand he was married to congresswoman helen gahagan douglas whom young richard nixon accused of being soft on communism and which ruined her jason robards sr has a small role in the film but his political activism was no less noticeable more importantly his son jason robards jr would be for many years a very active liberal democrat almost the odd fellow out was cary grant whose strident conservatism reflected a majority political sentiment in hollywood that was already slipping but this was 1948 communism was a real perceived threat and the blacklist was just around the corner it would be another decade before political activism would reappear in mainstream films and then not so subtly
5,this movie is slow spent most of the movie actually waiting for it to beginbr br the setting was bleak the script was bleak the cinematography was bleak the plot was bleak the budget was low not that all low budget movies are bad but this one had no redeeming featuresbr br the plot was more consumed with a vengeful slightly deranged hunter than the actual wendigo which made a very brief appearance toward the end of the movie this in itself was disappointing as this wendigo was just a bizarre mix of a tree and a stag everything about the movie was uninspiringbr br the parents of the little boy appeared to be rather aloof and at times seemed completely detached from their son whether this was down to bad acting or a bad script im not sure but it only heightened my disappointment and boredom levelsbr br there was no food for thought nothing to pique an interest with no real intrigue or chill factor this movie creaked along so painfully you just couldnt care less what happened by the endbr br wendigos ambiance reminds me of the dull movie shown at the awards ceremony toward the end of mr beans holiday a movie which is artistic and nonsensical trying too hard to to be deep and meaningful but coming across as pretentious and boringbr br i would never want to watch this again i only watched it to the end in the vain hope that something interesting might happen  but it didnt
1,to my surprise i quite enjoyed spacecamp i remember seeing it about 13 years ago and recently i hired it again i was quite impressed obviously the special effects in todays space films such as armageddon and deep impact are far superior to those in spacecamp however this film had a story a very stereotypical eighties story where you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before hearing it but thats what i liked about it they dont make films like this anymore so it was a refreshing change it was interesting to see kelly preston leaf phoenix and lea thomson in early roles with tom skerrit and kate capshaw to add substance to the light  fluffy plot absolutely loved the robot named jinx it was very cute but it unfortunately had more emotion than some of the main characters the film was almost inspirational in its own way and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at the nasa spacecamp in alabama i think
1,normally i dont have a problem with gratuitous swearing in films but this one really annoyed me all they did was swear for the whole film and as someone else noted get cancer it was boring rambling and pretentious i wouldnt if i were you br br its also not that i dont like films which as most people who like it will claim observe life i love eat drink man woman and all that happens in that is that a load of taiwanese people lead their lives but i could relate to them i have never met anyone who swore as much as the actors in this film and i used to work on a construction site so go figure having said that william h macy made me grin once br br 210 avoid unless you enjoy tedium

6,when i think about this movie all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world texture smell color thats how i think this movie should be judged in terms of see the rich golden tones surrounding the young concubine asleep by the fireplace or the sweltering turkish bath and let it flood your senses with impressions of spice coarse cloth smooth skin scented oils flickering flames satin rustle dont just watch and listen be absorbed let the droning voice of the storyteller mesmerize you
0,wonderful movie with good story great humour some great oneliners and a soundtrack to die forbr br ive seen it times so farbr br the american audiences are going to love it
5,i watched cabin by the lake this afternoon on usa considering this movie was made for tv is was interesting enough to watch the sequel so i tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely disappointed i knew i wouldnt like the movie but i was not expecting to be perplexed by the use of dv digital video the movie would have been tolerable if it wasnt for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere i expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots but there seemed to be no logical explanation warning the following maybe a spoiler the open ending in cabin by the lake was acceptable but the open ending on the sequel is ridiculous i can only foresee return of return to the cabin by the lake being watch able is if the movie was shown up against nothing but infomercials at oclock in the morning
7,i love this film its one of those i can watch again and again it is acted well by a good cast that doesnt try too hard to be star studdedbr br the premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pot to make ends meet could have been made into an americanised turd of a movie or an action thriller either would have killed the film completelybr br the film plays out like an ealing comedy with a terrific feelgood factor throughoutbr br it is worth watching just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes no thats not a spoiler
0,when i first read the plot of this drama i assumed it was going to be like sex and the city however this drama is nothing like it the stories the characters seem more real and you empathise with the situations more the concept of the drama is similar four 30 something women guide us through there friendships and relationships with problems and strife along the way katie the gp is a dark and brooding character who you find difficult to relate too and is best friends with trudi a widow trudis character is heart warming as you can relate to difficulties she is having along with the fact she is the only mother of the four jessica is the party girl very single minded and knows what she wants and how to get it she is a likable character and is closest to siobhan the newly wed who whilst loving her husband completely cant help her eyes wandering to her work colleague over all the drama is surprisingly addictive and if the bbc continue to produce the series it could do well it is unlike other female cast dramas such as sex and the city or desperate housewives this if played right could be the next cold feet plus the male cast are not bad on the eyes too
0,the premise to this movie was one which focused on the polarization of of ideologies in the united states this was a highly combustible scenario in america whereby two entirely different cultures collided what justified such heinously depraved actions anyway as this film presents the scenewhile hickock and smith drank these two men were not intoxicated nor were they under any kind of influence of drugs it was a clear cut case of cold and calculated deliberation basically these violent acts were the end result of emotional and social neglect anytime past 1975 we as a nation have nurtured an empathy for deviates who have been victimized by their environment however this incident takes place in 1959 this dreadful revelation sideswiped us and mired the nation into a tailspin of conflicting ethics with the recent release of the movie capote based on truman capote who was the creator of the documentary in cold blood the american people have cultivated a new found fascination with this film robert blake played the role of perry smith one of the villains in this movie this is seemingly appropriate given the notoriety he has been involved with concerning his personal life in cold blood centers on the element of the unexplained there was no vengeance involved there was no material gain to be acquired there was no potential for social advancement here either this is merely an instance of a latent and insidiously belligerent anger which ends certainly did not justify the means the situational diatribes which hickock and smith lamented about were always ambiguous under the circumstances why then should they take their frustrations out on an anonymously unsuspecting and innocent kansas family will geer grandpa walton plays the prosecuting attorney who is sickened by this act of macabre capriciousness his argument is thoroughly convincing his contention being these two men who demonstrated no mercy are now asking for yours this is a line of logic which would induce me to render a verdict of a conviction if i were to be one of the members of the jury absolute disdain for your precarious plight in life does not serve as vindication for orchestrating a capital crime it was capotes instincts that dictated that such a deranged act of violence should have been brought to the american publics attention as it turn out it was a harbinger of things to come in cold blood did just that this incident was the calm before the storm relating to a pertinent aspect of emergence to the radical 1960s such a lethal charade also served as an insight to the isolated interests which would besiege many typical americans for the futurebr br truman capote does a tremendous job on authenticating this savage occurrence with his book which was a best seller and with this documentary as well the acting in this film by robert blake and scott wilson as well as people like john forsythe was incredible the director richard brooks cat on a hot tin roof blackboard jungle elmer gantry and key largo to name but a few was outstanding in his collaborative efforts in this movie i think that in cold blood is one of the best films in the history of movies the film depicts two reprehensible spawns of depravity who delved into demented theatrics and wound up captivating a trite gratification for being acknowledged at a pejorative nationwide level this movie pinpoints a psychological discontentment which spurs on an emerging bevy of counter culture purveyors of violence our nations ideologies are incredibly different now than they were in 1959 this movie introduces the american people to the emotional and vacillating culprits who initiated such a precarious metamorphosis in our overall value system i recommend to everyone that they see this moviein cold blood was the focal point to the film capote think about it making a movie about a movie constitutes a rare and coveted accolade in hollywood in the case of in cold blood it is an extreme example of a movie which is vicariously clairvoyant intellectually elevating and of course it goes without saying in cold blood was utterly spellbinding as well as a totally remarkable movie
6,im not going to bother with a plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and theres almost no plot anyway ive seen several reviewers call isoyg an antirape film or even a feminist statement and i just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claimsbr br first of all what do we see on the cover of this movie thats right a shapely womans behind whether it was zarchis attempt to make an antirape statement  and i absolutely dont believe it was  is entirely beside the point the film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic everything but actual penetration is shown that no one but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy itbr br the rapes in the film is uncomfortable brutal and hard to watch theres something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes none there was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed mere moments before hes murdered so the scene isnt at all engaging on an emotional level really its just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies isoyg is associated with on imdb caligula cannibal ferox etc that it attracts only the exploitation crowdbr br finally a few reviewers have commended zarchis socalled documentary style and lack of a soundtrack but considering how inept everything else in the film is acting script etc i suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porncaliber actors do their thingbr br im not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of isoyg im all for exploitation  horror and love video nasties in fact im giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films however its also poorly made and after the rape occurs just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of hohum mostly goreless murders and wait for the credits to rollbr br this is probably worth watching once if youre a hardcore 70s exploitation fan but im telling you the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation
0,theres little to get excited about dan in real life first off the whole setup is incredibly contrived did you really believe that during that very long first meeting conversation at the restaurant marie wouldnt have told dan where she was going and since dan did all the talking during that conversation why would she be so attracted to him for that matter i never figured out why marie was so attracted to dan throughout the movie hes very narcissistic and does little to convince us that hes truly a good guy for example he lies to marie in the bookstore ridicules his brother about his past girlfriends and tries to make marie jealous with a blind date theres more contrivance such as that ridiculous scene at the bowling alley where dan and marie are caught making out by the whole family yeah like that could really happen dan in real life is slowpaced sappy and manipulative even chick flicks like the jane austen book club get higher marks than this predictable tearjerker
2,jeff wincott is not only a hunk he can kick butt this movie has some of the best martial arts moves ive seen in a very long time ok so maybe bridgette nielson isnt the first person id hire to play a ruthless politician she did a great job nontheless and lets not forget that wincott has a partner in this movie played by martial arts expertstuntwoman karen sheperd so shes not cynthia rothrock who cares shes just as good if not better just check out her fight scene at the end of the movie one word ouch my suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible because if you havent seen it youre really missing out on some great martial arts action

0,heather graham couldnt play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it who do the producers of the movie think they are the absolute worst most unrealistic movie ive seen in as long as i can remember this movie is so bad that i felt compelled to signup on imdb and make sure the rating of this film dropsbr br omg im heather graham i just kissed a drunk chick so while shes passed out im really going to pace around my room for hours asking myself frantically what have i done jesus heather get over it and grow up and id like to forward that same sentiment to the idiot producers and while im at it instead of this movie being all about an pathetic excuse for a coming out story perhaps it would have been more suitable to focus the plot onto a character whos mentally unstable like your socalled lesbian character after all i know the first time i had gay sex when i left the next morning i jumped to the sky in excitement in the middle of the street honestly btch get a grip br br what a joke and please note there are many many many more flaws and appallingly stupid aspects to this lame flick but im so sick of even thinking about it anymore bottom line if youre a smart person youll hate this movie and if youre not a smart person then youll love it its as simple as that
3,the directors cut version which was the one i saw was very long for this type of movie almost two hours is way too long if you have the choice definitely go for the nondirectors cutbr br the main plot is almost not taken up at all the movie consists to the main part of several murder scenes which are connected but the feeling is that theyre only shown in order to fill the movie with splatterish violence the connection is not revealed until the latter part and the lack of context bored me out long before i was therebr br as a horror movie it doesnt work you never get the required feel for the characters due to mediocre acting and the general disposition character is presented 15 minutes later character is dead this pictures strong side lies in the splatter part
0,after reading several good reviews as well as hearing nice things about it by word of mouth i decided to rent come undone i must say i was rather disappointed the story was hard to follow because the film is set as a series of flashbacks between the present and recent past that are very poorly executed the characters despite the actors best efforts are flat and uninteresting the sex is and nudity are more explicit than they need to be ive never seen a film where they seemed so unnecessary to the plot the ending is very anticlimatic and leaves many unanswered questions to a story line that wasnt explained well to begin with in my opinion a waste of time
1,this is a docudrama story on the lindy chamberlain case and a look at its impact on australian society it especially looks at the problem of innuendo gossip and expectation when dealing with reallife dramasbr br one issue the story deals with is the way it is expected people will all give the same emotional response to similar situations not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis just because the characters in the movies and on tv act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so this is especially apt for journalists and news editors who appear to be looking for the the big sob scene that will pull the ratings its an issue that has to be constantly addressedbr br the leads play the characters with depth personality and sensitivity and they are ably supported by a large cast all playing basedonfact individuals some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting cast in this story are people better known in australia as comic actors it reenforces my idea that comic actors make some of the best supports in dramas because with comedy they know how to establish quick impressions of individualsbr br spoiler warningbr br i have to say something very personal here in that i am actually an exadventist who was a practicing member in australia at the time this incident occurred so i have a slightly different impression of the story than most i think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality and emotional heart i think the best scene is the one where the couple are hounded by the new choppers it captured the themes of the story brilliantlybr br i once heard fred schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to play the best case for their character they could while this is especially apt for this story i think it is also a general principle that should apply to all acting as well

5,one of the great things about many of the superb chinese movies you can find if you are lucky in the video stores is they are very accurate retellings of actual true stories farewell my concubine the emperor and the assassin and this movie are perfect examples the film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience  the hallmark of much hollywood and especially disney filmsbr br in this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the king of masks for his mastery of sichuan change art along an having lost his only son many years earlier he searches to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that forbids females to have such work master wang is sold a son by a slave trader all is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art but the son eventually is found out to be a girl from there the story get very interesting with a good performance by master liang of the sichuan opera  a regional operatic style related to peking opera fans of farewell my concubine should look carefully at master liangs portrayal of a male playing the female role in chinese opera it may help them come to understand that the players of these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrati but people who have be so psychologically conditioned as to be totally unaware of their own sexuality
3,in the ten years since wildside aired nothing has really come close to its quality in local production this includes the two series of the enjoyable but overrated underbelly which have brought to life events in the recent criminal history of both sydney and melbourne the miniseries blue murder which also starred tony martin but as someone on the other side of the law may be the exceptionbr br wildside is currently being repeated late at night on the abc having not watched the show in quite a while im still impressed by its uncompromising story lines and very human characters the cast is excellent tony martin as a detective haunted by the disappearance of his son rachael blake who later hooked up with martin in real life as a community worker struggling with alcoholism and alex dimitriades as a young cop whose vice is gambling equally good support roles are provided by aaron pederson jessica napier mary coustas yes effie herself and a young abbie cornishbr br the abc inexplicably released only the first three episodes on dvd a couple of years ago the logic of this sort of marketing is beyond me but im guessing it may have something to do with licensing disagreements with the original producersbr br a great series which has aged remarkably well heres hoping the abcs dvd department gets its act togetherbr br according to a moderator on an abc message board some sort of further dvd release is due in december 2009
0,the second half of steven soderberghs revolutionary bio on che guevara deals with his last campaign to export revolution to bolivia in order to maintain his saintly visage of che soderbergh conveniently leap frogs the mass executions he presided over after the revolution in cuba and the folly of his congo adventure this is the history of a failure he writes in the preface of his congo journal to concentrate fully on ches attempt to rally support to rise up against the government in bolivia it would turn out to be a disaster and guevaras final actbr br what plagued the first chapter follows suit here as soderbergh slows his film to a crawl to study the beatific countenance of the contemplative guevara once again being played like james dean in east of eden by bernicio del toro the problem is guevara has little success in gaining converts and he soon finds himself and his starving comrades being swallowed up in the heart of darkness bolivian jungle unlike werner herzog in the magnificent aguirre the wrath of god soderbergh fails to utilize the jungles metaphorical possibilities to heighten the desperation of the guerrillas he seems more concerned with keeping ches nimbus above his head than exploring the panic setting in on the dead enders there is one herzogian moment where che sits astride an obstinate horse kicking and screaming to get it moving but overall soderberghs mise en scene remains flat sloppy and uninteresting br br in both of his films soderbergh shows he is clearly a che groupie and because of it his focus remains myopic and narrow he spends too much time building his monument to che and too little in developing his relationships with key players in his saga especially fidel castro making matters worse he does it with a slow and dispassionate approach that never catches fire one would think he was steeped in enough eisenstein and vertov to realize that sweeping change is showcased a lot better with sweeping style

2,this seems like two films one a dreary pretentious lengthy saga about an actor who is taken over by the parts he plays the other a brilliant social comment about a middle aged divorce who is picked up by a waitress shelley winters is wonderful as a waitress with another business on the side she drops heavy hints about the need for connections her certificate in massage and her desire to get into the modelling game i love the glimpse of her seedy flat with a kitchenette behind a curtain and her terrible seducing outfit of navelrevealing puffsleeved crochet topbr br do actors get oscars for shakespeare we know they oscars for impersonating disabled people wearing a lot of prosthetics or pretending to be mad the shakespearean scenes which go on and on are embarrassing and dated and so are the going mad scenes where tony looks distracted while listening to his own voiceoverbr br by the way anthony john is not aristocratic he makes it quite clear in an early scene that he used to be a chorus boy when he quotes his fathers advice he slips into a cockney accent
0,who could possibly have wished for a sequel to bert i gordons legendary bad trashfilm food of the gods nobody of course but director damien lee thought it was a good idea anyway and he put together a belated sequel that stands as one of the most redundant movies in horror history gnaw is a sequel in name only as the setting moved to a typical late 80s location a university campus and also the cheap  cheesy gore effects perfectly illustrates the 80s this script hangs together by clichs awfully written dialogs and plot situations that are not so subtly stolen from other and more successful horror classics neil hamilton is a goody two shoes scientist who performs growingexperiments on ordinary rodents in order to do a fellow scientist a favor due to some incredibly stupid animal rights activists the huge and ravenous rats escape and devour pretty much everyone on campus following the good old tradition that spielbergs jaws started theres an obnoxious dean who refuses to admit the problem even though severely mutilated corpses are turning up everywhere during a hysterically grotesque climax the rats invade the opening ceremony of the campus new sport complex gnaw food of the gods is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch the characters do and say unimaginably stupid stuff like descending into the sewers unarmed while they know its infested with rats the acting is atrocious and theres a genuinely bizarre sequence involving the hero having sex under the influence of growthserum i wonder what freuds theory would be on that theres a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and  it has to be said  the music is surprisingly atmospheric in case you just cant get enough of this junk there are quite a lot of creaturefeatures revolving on mutated rats like the italian schlock film rats night of terror the modest 70s cult film willard and its lame sequel ben the 2003 willard remake starring crispin glover and the surprisingly good recent ratmovies by oncefamous directors tibor ticaks rats and john lafia the rats go nuts

3,im not sure what diane silver was thinking when she was making this movie but it obviously had nothing to do with richard wrights novel which the movie is based onbr br we read the novel this past summer for ap english 12 and just watched the film during periodic notetaking and checking of the clock i contemplated the chances of being struck by lightning of course the sky was completely clear and i was forced to watch the rest of the movie and then write a 5paragraph essay on itbr br wrights novel discussed very real themes of the mind of a killer and the psychology behind it silvers movie turned a murderer into a victim which is not what wright wanted see how bigger was born 454br br im going to make this short and sweet if you want to leave your consciousness in raphael lamberts words unsullied skip the movie and read the book the 1986 adaptation is not thoughtprovoking materialbr br  sigh now i have to write the essay
5,i have never seen any of spike lees prior films as their trailers never caught my interest i have seen and admire denzel washington and jodie fosters work and have several of their dvds i was however entirely disappointed with this movie if this film is any indication of spike lees ability as a director my advice would be to get a job and stop wasting the time and talent of others br br i wonder if some of the other imdb commentators watched the same movie that id seen i can only assume from their sappy lovelorn reviews that their adoration of spike lee has blinded them to the banality of this piece of work i only paid 250 in a second run theater and still felt id wasted my moneybr br the imdb trivia page says it allbr br  shot in 39 days  how can you expect to shoot a big budget blockbuster as the media hype promised in such a short time no wonder there was such a weak performance by allbr br  ron howard was first going to direct the film  he may have done this project some justice given more time to do so of course though the writing was atrocious the premise had some merits br br ok maybe not im sorry this film was so rife with pitiful clichs implausible scenes and lousy characterizations that maybe even he couldnt have made much of it hey ron be sure to thank russellgood call br br  jodie foster filmed her part in three weeks  and it showed her portrayal of a fixer who makes peoples problems go away was as unbelievable as the script she was given did she even want to be therebr br other peeves br br  how many bank robbers would bother to come to the door and inform a uniformed police officer that they were inside robbing the bank and hed better keep awayor else br br  when detective frazier denzel washington comes into the bank to verify there are no corpses yet how many bank robbers without a gun would have led a cop much less let a cop back out to the front door allowing the police officer to walk behind him br br  det frazier later claimed to have given the robber every reason to shoot me why then in their brief struggle didnt he even try to expose the robbers face that may have gotten the response he was looking fora robber would have shot him just to prevent later identification and why did it take steve stevie steveo the robbers accomplice so long to come and help out br br  i understand that these werent your typical bank robbers they had a different agenda and didnt want anyone harmed but the cops had no reason to think that they wouldnt to them it was a desperate situation why then when two of the bad guys stepped outside to pick up the pizzas were they not taken down first of all how many robbers would have came outside without using a hostage as a shield is this spike lees version of ny city or snls taking them down would have reduced the bad guys numbers screwed up their plans and the remaining robbers would more probably have given up if not there at least would be fewer bad guys inside give swat something to do or send them homebr br  what police department in this country would have allowed madeline white jodie foster to just waltz right into the bank and discuss a matter with the robbers that she would not disclose to them first she had no authority no governmental credentials and besides this was after all already a hostage situationadd one morebr br  why wouldnt the bank ceo christopher plummer just have destroyed the incriminating documents a long time ago screw sentimentality the diamonds he could have soldbr br  who was that schmuck the character not the actor with the jersey accent that conveniently volunteered and said he knew the recording was 100 albanian but yet he himself couldnt speak itsir put your hand down and his exwife what a schlump she was both were totally unbelievable br br  when interrogating suspects why did det frazier continually harass the individuals who were obviously not a part of the heist ie  telling the elderly woman she could go and then she couldnt then could then couldnt give me a break br br  who after seeing the bank robbers demand that the hostages put on jump suites couldnt deduce their escape plan included coming out of the bank pretending to be some of the hostages br br  near the end of the movie a false wall was shown to have been built in the supply room behind which clive owens hid out for a weekwhere did the materials come from the drywall  studs it was also to be assumed that they cut into the sewer so he could relieve himself the bank employees hadnt complained about the smell all week long hellobr br  after such a debacle since the documents had fallen into the robbers hands what kind of references was ms white expecting to get from the bank ceo seeing that he was now to be a target for blackmail due to her failurebr br  and last but certainly not least whats with the electric glide that denzel did how stupid was that supposed to indicate his resolve to bring these guys to justice he looked rather like a man who hopped a ride on a shopping cart while trying to prevent a bowel movement cheeeezheeee br br other than the mediocre plot lousy script bad acting and overall pitiful directingyada yada yada br br hopefully this will give enough insight into the movie to help others decide whether to waste their money or notbr br 
7,i have been wanting to see cut since the day i have heard of it which was sometime last year anyway i got to see today and when the movie started i thought that it started rather week but it got better after 10 mins or so i thought that the movie was pretty good but the thing i didnt like was how the killer was created i was thinking just before i rented that it would probably suck just like urban legends final cut i almost died it mostly everything in ul final cut needed to be improved cut is 100 times better than ulfinal cut the best part of cut is the killer and the death scenes the killer kicks mo fing assbr br i give cut a out of 10
6,emilio miraglios the red queen kills seven times 1972 is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that i have ever seen mixing all the requisite elements into one sinister stew indeed first of all and of paramount importance for me it has a complex twisty plot that ultimately makes perfect sense and the killer here does not come completely out of left field at the end the story concerning a series of gruesome murders you already know how many from the films title right that takes place in seeming fulfillment of an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters is an involving one and the murderer a redcloaked figure with the insane laugh of a madwoman is both frightening and memorable every great giallo requires some lovely lead actresses and here we have quite an assortment headed by the ridiculously beautiful barbara bouchet as one of the two sisters and in one of her earlier roles sybil danning as a lustful tramp at barbaras fashion house another necessary ingredient of a superior giallo is a catchy hummable score and bruno nicolai provides one for this film that should stay with you for days gorgeous scenery check again filmed largely in wurzburg germany the picture is a treat for the eye indeed ok ok but what about those murders after all isnt that what gialli are all about well im pleased to report that most viewers should be well satisfied with the various knifings shootings impalements and other carnage that this film tastefully dishes outnot to mention the crypts freaky dream sequence rats and bats and lots of em too the drug references a rape scene the obligatory red herrings and in the person of ugo pagliai a hunky leading man for the female viewers as i said a perfect giallo and even better this dvd is from the fine folks at no shame and you know what that means a gorgeous print and loads of extras to boot thanks guys

1,id have given this film a few stars simply because it was a lifetime presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story  here new york city most on this channel whether set there in rural iowa oregon virginia la etc are filmed in vancouver ottawa toronto or some other canadian localebr br but if there ever were one deserving the top rating  10 on this site its this movie certainly not for originality for this story has been done many times in many variations with several very similar to this specific one its also been done pretty often on the big screen with megastars past and present from cary grant james garner harrison ford tom hanks et al  and deborah kerr doris day meg ryan and many more i can think of at least 1012 more just as prominent past to present off the top of my head who could be added now and there are probably many others which could be brought to mindbr br not to drone on but my point is that in my opinion this is by far one of the best of this genre ive seen i caught it by chance on a midday friday at a time when i had the tv on only because i was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week id never run across this flick in the years since it was made and while the two leads have done enough to be known to most they were completely unknown to me the only two actors i knew were phyllis newman annas mother whom id seen in some things from her younger days and michael rispoli henry charlies best friend who was outstanding as gramma the menacing juice loan tough street guy from rounders br br the chance meeting and coupling between both leads best friends as a substory romance with the correlation of their being such to anna and charlie being only revealed to all later is an oftdone plot contrivance within the genre but makes no difference to the enjoyment here in fact it enhances itbr br checking some other comments i agree completely with those which are the most positive the primary word describing this film is engaging in caps this adjective describes the performers the characters the chemistry between and among all of the characters in whatever combination presented and all of the supporting and even minor rolesbr br i love films with a harder edge rounders the escapist schwarzeneggerstallone fare goodfellows even the classics like casablanca gone with the wind citizen kane but for pure uncomplicated enjoyment this one was outstanding with a bare fraction of their budgets it was equal to the results achieved by youve got mail and sleepless in seattle and tom hanks and meg ryan couldnt have done better than natasha henstridge and michael vartan here the costars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these megafilms as well
0,a thief in the night is an excellent fictional account of the weeks leading up to the rapture and the weeks following that pivotal eventbr br i thoroughly enjoyed both the production values and the content values of this independent christian moviebr br the production values hey its an independent movie with a shoestring budget so ya its going to look a bit cheesy if your standard is alist hollywood fare but properly compared with other independent movies this film is perfectly acceptable more important than acting style costumes and music is the narrative itself is the story compelling do the dramatic moments work does the story trajectory build to a satisfying climax the answer to all these questions is an unqualified yes as a sidenote the truly important technical stuffcontinuity sound lightingare fine the viewer is able to watch the show without being distracted by sloppy craftsmanshipbr br content value the message of the movie is superb when you consider how many ideas the moviemaker developed within the brief span of 69 minutes you begin to appreciate his artistry he presents the message of salvation the consequence of unbelief the danger of backsliding the truth of the rapture and the threat of a worlddominating satanic government with flare imagination andmost importantly for an evangelical moviewith biblical accuracybr br the moviemaker is a good storyteller for example he develops the message of salvation in two important ways he shows us through action the reality of jesus christs sacrifice for our sake this is achieved in a subplot where the zookeeper is bit by a poisonous snake and nearly dies the only cure is blood from someone who is immune to the snakepoison the poison is like sin the cure is like christs blood shed on the cross the filmmaker also develops the message of salvation through dialog he has various characters explain the truth about human sin and the need for salvation through faith in christ so the moviemaker uses both action and dialog to tell his storybr br as a sidenote the fact that a movie produced by evangelical christians actually contains dialog and scenes that convey a clearly delineated message of salvation couched in explicitly evangelical christian language imagery and theology is also perfectly acceptable to criticize this film for being explicitly christian is absurd its akin to criticizing a nike commercial for promoting sportwear what else would evangelical christian movie makers make if not a film that states their case also the fact that the moviemaker employs the idea that the unbelieving will be left behind in a godless world is again perfectly acceptable the moviemaker uses the dramatic potential of that idea admirably how do i know i heard about a thief in the night from a woman who saw the show way back in 1974 it still lived in her memory thirty years later how many movies can you say that about all around a very enjoyable thoughtprovoking show i plan on showing it to my teen group at church
1,this is one of those feel good saturday afternoon movies its right up there with other retro flicks like flight of the navigator just a cute movie with some subtle comedy to lighten things up and its fun to see how 20 years has changed the stars like kelly preston and lea thompson not to mention joquin phoenixbr br i personally really like movies like this from time to time nothing too deep or too scary just a nice story line and i would have never known mr phoenix had i not recently read the credits he was just a baby really when he made this moviebr br kelly preston was quite the young budding actress then too she and lea did a wonderful job in this movie i agree its not an oscar caliber movie but very much worth watching especially if you have kids in the  lets say to 11 year old range or ones that are interested in the space program

5,having enjoyed joyces complex novel so keenly i was prepared to be disappointed by joseph stricks and fred hainess screenplay given the fabulous complexity of the original text however the film turned out to be very well done and a fine translation of the tone naturalism and levity of the bookbr br it certainly helps to have read the original text before viewing the film i imagine the latter would seem disjointed with very odd episodes apparently randomly stitched together without a prior reading of the text to help grasp the plotbr br its amazing to see how filthy the film is given that it was shot in dublin in 1967 the irish film censors only finally unbanned it for viewing by general audiences in ireland as late as 2000 it was shown to restricted audiences in a private cinema club the irish film theatre in the late 1970s joyces eroticism is not simply naturalistic and raunchy it offers many wildly perverse episodes never mind that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922  they were still utterly taboo when the film was made in 1967br br it is astonishing and heartening to watch the cream of the irish acting profession of the 1960s respected players all daring to utter and enact joyces hugely transgressive text with such gustobr br bravo
0,utter dreck i got to the 16 minute27 second point and gave up id have given it a negative number review if that were possible although pissible is a more fitting word unlike the sizzle you could see and practically feel between macmurray and stanwyck in the original the chemistry between dumb ol dicky crenna and whatsherface here is just nonexistent the anklet becomes an unattractive chunky bracelet theres no ciggylightingbyfingertip and i thought id be sick when they have a mortifiedlooking and rightly so believe you me lee j cobb as keyes practically burpingupchucking his way through the explanation of his little man to mr garloupis no offence to the nonsighted but it looks as though a posse of blind men ran amuck with the set design of both the dietrichson and neff houses the same goes for those horrid plaid pants that phyllis wears and crikey how much  does neff make that he lives overlooking a huge marina this folks again all takes place in the first 16 and a half minutes if you can get through more of it you have a much stronger constitution than me or you are a masochist but please take some alkaseltzer first or you will develop a little man of your own that may never go away proceed with caution obviously
6,the opening shot was the best thing about this movie because it gave you hope that you would be seeing a passionate wellcrafted independent film damn that opening shot for filling me hope as the film progressed in a slow plodding manner my thoughts were varied in relation to this film was there too much butter in my popcorn did the actors have to pay the director to be in this film did i get my ticket validated at the box office yes dear reader i saw this film in the theatre this would be the only exception i will make about seeing a film at home over a movie theatre because at home you can turn it off were there any redeeming values peter lemongelli as the standard college nerd had his moments especially in a dog collar other than that this film went from trying to be a comedy to a family drama to a spiritual uplifter it succeeded on none of these fronts oh and the girlfriend was realllllllllly bad her performance was the only comedy i found
1,well after three times through i still have no idea what this movie is about because quite honestly it failed to generate any real interest or concern but here it goes a bunch of too old to be teen teen actors dressed in horrifying latter 1980s fashions did we look like that too decide it would be a really good idea to get in a motorboat and go visit the abandoned alcatraz after one of them has nightmares of people being slaughtered in various horrifying ways that manage to rip off poltergeist the evil dead and freddy kreuger in one fell swoop the dimwit even envisions himself being roasted over an open fire with some deformed freak slicing off strips of tenderloin good thing it was only a dream or it might have hurt and good thing his dreams had a decent special effects budget mine are usually pretty lame girls model space ships blowing things up with a bazooka etcbr br once on the alcatraz island they find themselves in a slasher movie and meet up with tony basil who cannot help but break into a couple dance poses at times and had her own lighting crew complete with a smoke machine for that 1980s smoky haze infused light look which i kind of miss and such reminded me that ms basil helped choreograph david byrne of the talking heads for some of his videos and performances this of course has nothing at all to do with the film but kept popping into mind as the movie posed very little to actually think about it sort of happens and you can either watch or keep working on your page markup with it on the tv set off to the side but since the film isnt really interesting youll keep deciding to finish one last thing instead of wasting time the movie will keep ending and youll find yourself wondering what you missed every time you realize the end credits are starting to roll again dammit br br some 1980s teen horror movies can survive such specialized viewing umberto lenzis ghosthouse chopping mall  its killbots the hard to ignore night of the creeps and the overthetop sleepaway camp all come to mind they are films that like them or not demand your attention and usually pay off with some good gore or ta and typos in your work as evidence that you were watching the tv instead of your keyboard i am sure that hell island as the british version i glommed onto is titled does indeed have some good stuff in there but frankly i dont care and nothing is more annoying that encountering art of any genre that doesnt inspire admiration some decent dislike or even good old honest hatred for it the film is content with simpering away 80whatever minutes of time and never really accomplishing anything more than being a sometimes distraction in spite of my best efforts to try and give it a chance but no dicebr br there is some offbeat production design going on the use of lighting is striking at times and the occasional outburst of mayhem will probably keep fans of 1980s teen horror interested the rest of you be warned though you will wonder if you dressed like that in 1987 and the answer is probably more hideous than anything which happens on screen try to watch it as a free rental if possible so that if disappointed you arent stuck with the damn thing movies like this take up valuable shelf space that is often at a commodity these days what with the world coming to an end  all 
0,in the title i write that the story is ludicrous below ill elaborate and tell you why it in my humble opinion ruins this moviebr br gere and danes are doing their jobs and while its not their best work its quite ok the rest of the cast though is doing a really poor job mind you this is not entirely the actors fault the problem is that gere and danes are the only ones that have characters that have even the slightest room in the movie to really give any depth all other characters have either too little room in the movie to create any depth or the character is such a clich that it doesnt matter how hard the actors trybr br the director has a bit of a se7en complex but looking merely at the direction i think he does an ok jobbr br but the story this is the kind of script that is bad in two ways first of all its a bad movie script the characters are shallow except for geres and danes characters the villains are clichs and the actions of the characters is totally unbelievable besides this the writers must have an agenda where they want to bring back our views and ethics a hundred years its the kind of movie that are saying that some criminals are still criminals regardless of the fact that they have paid the price the society has given them its also the kind of movie that says albeit only between the lines that every form of sexual deviance should be punished without trial judge or jury and of course according to the movie everything that is not sex in the missionary position by a married couple is a sexual deviancebr br so if youre going to film school and need an example of a bad script or if youre writing scripts yourself and want an ego boost see it for everyone else i recommend another movie
5,this movie is by far the worst movie ever made if you have to create a film costarring the guy who plays lars in heavyweights than dont make the damn film i have to say that i could watch leprechaun in space times before i could watch the trailer for this pos of a movie adam sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace watching this movie is like a mix of listening to cher and willingly putting your dick in a blender anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime if i had an extra dollar and had to spend it id give it to the support lorraina bobbitt foundation before buying this movie
2,now days most people dont watch classic movies such as this most of friends only watch movies from the 90s to present thats kinda stingy br br most old movies like this are masterpieces unique in their own way only because back when these movies were being thought of and made thats when ideas were fresh now people strain just to think of new ideas br br anyway to the movie for true fans of classic horror this is for you the movie is based with a investigator from scotland yard investigating the disappearance of an movie actor and stumbles on to three other strange occurrences with past residents of the same house br br i wont say anymore for i will ruin the movie more than i already have but it is a terrific movie for as old as it is and would never mind watching it again
4,cut is a fulltilt spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do most of the standard slasher cliches are there the old creepy house the woods the anonymous indestructible serial killer buckets of gore and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while theyre having sex thats hardly a spoilerbr br the setup is simplicity itself filmschool nerds set out to complete an unfinished slasher masterpiece unfinished because of the murders of a couple of the cast this also neatly  okay messily  disposes of kylie minogue in the first reel they are joined by one of the survivors of the original film played by molly ringwald who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines the rest of the cast fit their roles well especially the lovely jessica napier who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around herbr br there are plenty of red herrings and fake suspenseful moments and there is very little time to try to work out who the killer is because the film moves at such a fast pace it also has an appropriate low budget look including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate good soundtrack too if there is a difficulty with this film it is deciding whether it is a sendup of or a homage to the slasher genre probably a bit of both
6,this reboot is like a processed mcdonalds meal compared to ang lees very good but very underrated 2003 the incredible hulkbr br ang lees the hulk is a comic book movie for the thinking person the hulk takes some time to appear about 40 minutes but when he does we see the conflict at our protagonists core he does his best to avoid losing control but as he admits when he does give in to his rage he likes itbr br now compare this to edward nortons turn where there is no display of conflict in his personality and he turns into the hulk whenever he becomes excited and his pulse rate hits 200 beats per minute not 183 not 197 but exactly 200 to this reviewer this felt akin to the introduction of midichlorians in the phantom menace which tell how strong the force is with one as if mystical abilities can be gauged through a blood test in the 2008 movie all ed nortons bruce banner has to do is to keep his pulse rate under 200 as monitored by a device strapped onto his wrist and for the record it is extremely difficult to get ones pulse rate up to 200 even through a very exhilarating run especially for a physically fit personbr br emotions drive eric banas hulk he has repressed memories of his mothers death and his fathers role in his early life on the surface he is calm but there underneath there is significant anger enough rage to fuel the hulk when it is unleashed but the hulk never kills intentionally even his attackers mostly he just wants to get away or close to betty ross jennifer connelly he incapacitates his shooters and in one critical scene saves a fighter jet pursuing him from a collisionbr br in the 2003 movie the visual effects are there but as necessary the action scenes and there are plenty of them are necessary to the plot unlike the 2008 movie where action is inserted for the sake of actionbr br in his quest to turn it into a fugitive story ed norton loses focus on how bruce banner feels about the hulk to him the hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment went awry and louis leterrier the director picking up on ed nortons cue fails to add any emotional dimension to the bannerhulk relationship the story can be summed up as banner is pursued and hulk kicks butt banner is pursed and hulk kick butt repeat as necessarybr br the only thing that went against the 2003 movie is that it is perhaps not as true to the comic books as the 2008 version however even as i am a fan of the comics i would prefer a movie that is not as true to the comics as a fanboys dream but has heart over the comicsloyal but manufactured and soulless 2008 version any daybr br perhaps ang lee should have read more comics iron man also released in 2008 is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comicbook roots and has heart
7,besides planes trains and automobiles and uncle buck this is john candys funniest movie when he gets hypnotized with the playing card similar to the manchurian candidate and becomes a horny guy who does not know what he is saying he makes two very memorable quotes both deal with the male anatomy the love scene involving grocery items has to be seen it cannot be describedbr br 
5,if jean renoirs first film whirlpool of fate first takes us into the world of the countryside the rivers the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards put the characters from the first two films together and you have the seeds of his great grand illusion and rules of the game this is beautifully filmed with the restless camera making full use of the amazingly huge apartments and backstage areas that dominate the films interiors and the acting though frequently overwrought offers some great moments as well particularly from werner krauss muffat but the glamorous and sultry ms hessling who at first appears as if she might give louise brooks a run for her money in vampishness never goes beyond a one note selfish harlot portrayal perhaps this is in part a problem with the script which does seem to mostly go for high points and outraged emotions not having read the novel im not really clear on whether the choices were wellmade or notbr br still the differences between nanas suitors are welldrawn and i particularly liked the relationship between muffat and jean angelos vandeuvres  the tragic understandings that each seems to have of his ultimate fate and their sympathy with each other particularly in the scene at the bottom of the enormous staircase where vandeuvres warns muffat and we wonder if violence will erupt  this and other gleanings of the ridiculousness of the idle rich help give the film the depth it hasbr br far from his greatest achievement and for me probably just shy overall of whirlpool of fate this is still well worth seeing for renoir fans or those interested in silent cinema generally
0,i just watched this movie today and not only is it terrible and awful but it looks like the director just got a few friends together to make a movie about a sick man i also think that this movie has the look of a porn video with its clear crisp just filmed viewbr br thank heavens i work in a video store and i didnt have to pay for it cause this movie is crap x infinitydo not buy or rent this movie youd have a better time watching dude wheres my car than this piece of crap and thats not saying a lot for that movie eitherbr br the acting is lousy and the movie is just very unwatchable i was watching this movie and i wanted to kill myself during and after the moviebr br i walked home and threw up after watching this piece of dirt movie i then took a shower and burnt my clothes br br if i had half a mind i would of took the movie outside and burned it too cause no one should be subjected to itwell maybe members of al quedaespecially the ones we have in custody and also child rapists who are in prison on life sentences with out parolejust make a set up like a clock work orange and then force these cheese head to watch it over and over again
6,now look i wont lie to you but i only got this movie for 399 from a friend because it had danni filth the lead singer of the ever popular death metal band cradle of filth in it i expected of course violence and gore at its finest as that is what mr filth can be portrayed as amongst a plot linebr br but dear god i was oh so wrong this movie seriously bites big time being a low budget film haha wait make that zero budget this obviously lacks the beautiful howard stern orchestra musical scores and the spielberg special effects nope its all one camera bad angles and bad blood scenesbr br take for example when our star and violent fiend mr filth violently kills a mugger a grab at the throat and blood spits out but oh my it looks like theres a juice packet filled with fake blood in the mans shirtbr br to you cradle of filth fans youll hear two songs throughout the movie but with the camera angles and shoddy filming they drag the overall pleasure of the song downbr br my final comment steer well away from it its blood gore breasts and hey even a shoddy story to go with it so if you like appalling violence near no voices yes theres hardly any words in this movie then by all means buy it but if shoddy movies isnt your thing then avoid it dont waste your money
6,i heard tell that madonna was briefly considered for the catherine tremell role compared to sharon stone madonna is too coarse and bauerisch shes not even close br br evil incarnate sharon stone is a bit long in the tooth the ameliorative effects of modern chemistry and surgery notwithstanding however she artfully treats us to a frightening personification of evil beyond redemption in the obligatory sex scene she projects pure crystalline lust especially her hooded luminous eyes and a face flat with pleasure thanks to brilliant use of lighting and other stage techniques the harsh lines of age are only occasionally manifest rather she seems to have a slight golden glow yes yeats br br the locations gave us a view of london that is a welcome departure from the usual londonscapes the catherine character is so powerful and menacing that i thank my lucky stars that our paths never crossed i wouldnt have had a chancebr br the original basic instinct attempts at censorship i must briefly comment on the original 1992 film set in san francisco a beautiful city worthy of this film it is outstanding from the music to the locations to the sets and so on paul verhoven pulled striking performances out of the cast and crew br br that the main baddie was a woman did not escape the scrutiny of bay area gay and lesbian activist groups attempts at censorship were vehemently denied swell these philosophical pygmies demanded editorial control over the script insisting on rewrites that would promote their political and psychiatrically driven agendas example sanctimoniously alleging sexism and misogyny they demanded that the lead role be switched from bad girl to bad guy br br on locations in san francisco the gentle tolerant activists did their best to sabotage filming of the scenes with noise flashing lights and other tactics the executive producers mario kassar and andrew vajna vowed to fight any efforts to restrict the artistic freedom guaranteed in our democracy and obtained restraining orders against the disruptive tactics br br blowback thanks to the fulminating activists the film got huge national press coverage  millions of dollars worth of free advertising their calls for viewers to boycott the film resulted in a backlash that had customers waiting in long lines wherever the film was launched it also received widespread critical acclaim it was in the words of the reptilian hackett in network a big titted hit sorry gentle reader i just couldnt resist that one yes its a gibebr br in conclusion i believe that both basic instinct and with their brilliant musical scores aesthetics and acting are works of art br br that deserve protection under our constitution
3,i havent seen this movie in about years but it still haunts me br br when asked about my favorite films this is the one that i seem to always mention first there are certain films works of art like this film dark city and breaking the waves that seem to touch a place within you a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer not unlike a lifechanging event such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend this film shook me when i first saw it it left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days
5,ive been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too some of the users are stuck in a realist type of mentality this film was meant to be a fantasya what if fun film it was never meant to be real or serious it was thoroughly enjoyable for everyone i knew when it came out  even though it shadowed the tragedy of the challenger explosioni was 30 at the time and totally enjoyed this one  my young son loved it too later i shared it with my daughter and she too loved it spacecamp is a fun family film that should be enjoyed for just that  fun all the realists in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film so sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real spacecamp one in alabama and one at vandenberg afb in california  they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt letdowni guess their parents didnt explain the difference between fantasy and reality oh well if you love fantasyfun films and havent seen this one i highly recommend it enjoy
0,well was morgan freeman any more unusual as god than george burns this film sure was better than that bore oh god i was totally engrossed and lmao all the way through carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe and aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance i for one dont consider her to be either ugly or untalented i think my favorite scene was when carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history see if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor i was rolling over this one well written and even better played out this comedy will go down as one of this funnymans best
7,all the bare chested women in the world couldnt keep me from hitting the stop button about a third of the way through this awful rubbish with the derisory acting equally terrible script plus the poor cgi fx to match this movie is an insult to the werewolf genre it is supposed to be serious which in itself would be funny if this film could even make it to the level of being a bad jokebr br this is one of those movies where the people behind the camera are obviously competent but are too lazy to make something even one quarter decent avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic werewolf movies insteadbr br out of 10
1,the remake of hb halickis classic seventies chase film is simply horrible along with vanishing point gone in 60 seconds represent the quintessential car chase films the remake takes the original and stands it on its head whereas halicki gave us 75 car chase and 25 supporting drama in giss 2000 we get 25 car chase and 75 supporting drama cage as super man saves his brother kisses the girl mtv edits tits and ass save your money rent the original at least halicki didnt live to see his baby he wrote produced directed and starred in the 74 film degraded in this manner
5,the cast of this film contain some of new zealanders better actors many of who i have seen in fabulous roles this film however fills me with a deep shame just to be from the same country as them the fake american accents are the first clue that things are about to go spectacularly wrong as another review rather astutely noted the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry decorated with a few of the multi colour flags stolen from a used car lot most of the cast appear to be from the great long running new zealand soap shortland street its as if this movie was dreamt up at a shortland street cast christmas party the result of too many gins and possibly a bit of salmonella imagine under siege meets the love boat staged by your local primary school and directed by an autistic and you get the ideabr br if you are an actor i recommend you see this film as a study on how to destroy your carer
3,at first i hadnt read the novel so far and i hadnt hear anything about the author yet but as i casually saw this movie i was totally captive by the story already as the jewish watchman primary said that he knows no one who have a bad conscience about the war except from howard w campbell junior was such amazing objective and dissociates from simply moralizing the war terrific and the fictitious story about the most effective spy for the usa in wwii who have lost everything that was important for his life is wonderful emotional transcribed this is the best story about the duality of humanity ive ever heard about the questions this movie is introducing are in my opinion very important for our society when does someone bear the guilt of something what is guilt who is a hero and who is a felon what is important in our life can you live without paying attention to the political changes is the protagonist guilty or not these questions are more up to date than in the last 60 years this is a must see for everyone who have to think about the acception of war this movie is a must see for everyone who meditate what matters in life and what doesnt
1,what can i say that hasnt been said about the haunting it has everything that would make a great picture wonderful sets moody music and sound design to die for were all in place the screenplay though sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird surrealistic way the entire team must have forgotten to read it through maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was each member of the cast gives a worthy performance although with little conviction to the material at hand lili taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her but thats about it all i can say is that it was a slightly enjoyable two hours but you will definitely want more a lot more
0,i commend pictures that try something different many films just seem like retreads of old ideas so that is the big reason i so strongly recommend passport to pimlicobr br the movie is set just after ww2 and the postwar shortages and rationing seem to be driving londoners barmy the film centers on a tiny neighborhood in london called pimlico they too are sick of not being able to buy what they want but can see no way out of it that is until they accidentally stumble upon a hidden treasure and a charter which officially named this neighborhood as a sovereign nation many hundreds of years ago with this document they reason they can bypass all the rationing and coupons and live life just as they want since it turns out they really arent british subjects where the movie goes from there and how the crisis is ultimately resolved is something youll need to see for yourselves leave it up the brilliant minds of ealing studios to come up with this gem
3,ive seen this film more than once now and theres always someone complaining about the obvious construction of the plot afterwards but then  this is part of petzolds game he plays along with the rules of genrebr br its very nice how the highly improbable story of how the two girls timoteohummer meet is again mirrored in another even more improbable story that the girls make up for a casting this film is a journey between fact and fiction its more about potentials things that might have happened in the past or might be happening in the future than it is about actual ongoings its a reverie sorts of  so apt enough there are a lot of motives freud might have found interesting for his dream analysis like all the doppelgangerconstellations br br also i think gespenster might be interesting to be watched in comparison to current asian cinema of the uncanny petzolds everyday urban architecture also feels haunted in an unobtrusive strangely familiar way this film is not about the obvious to describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers or as the story of an orphaned mother who searches europe for her lost daughter clearly doesnt say much about the nature of gespenster at all
2,lorenzo lamas stars as jack solider kelly an exvietnam vet and a renegade cop who goes on a search and destroy mission to save his sister from backwoods rednecks atrocious movie is so cheaply made and so bad that ron palillo is third billed and yet has minutes of screen time and even those arent any good overall a terrible movie but the scenes with lorenzo lamas and josie bell hanging from a tree bagged and gagged are worth a few unintentional laughs followed by an improved sequel
2,after the success of die hard and its sequels its no surprise really that in the 1990s a glut of die hard on a  movies cashed in on the wrong guy wrong place wrong time concept that is what they did with cliffhanger die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly stop or my mom will shoot stallones careerbr br cliffhanger is one big nitpickers dream especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing basejumping aviation facial expressions acting skills all in all its full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk stallone even managed to get outacted by a horse however if you an forget all the nonsense its actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills and unintentionally plenty of laughsbr br youve got to love john lithgows sneery evilness his tick every box band of baddies and best of all the permanently harassed and hapless turncoat agent rex linn as traversbr br he may of been henry in portrait of a serial killer but michael rooker is noteworthy for a cringeworthy performance as hal he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors that man never hurt anybody and whilst he surely cant be it really does look like ralph waites frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her deathbr br mention too must go to former londons burning actor craig fairbrass as the brit bad guy who comes a cropper whilst using hal as a human football yes you cant help enjoy that bit hal needed a good kickingbr br so forget your better judgement who cares if that could never happen lower your acting expectations turn up the volume and enjoy and if youre looking for qaulen hes the one wearing the helicopter
7,absolutely awful movie utter waste of timebr br background music is so loud that you cannot understand speech well if you really listen closely whatever they speak is actually unintelligiblebr br camera work is bad editing is not present background score gives a headache action is shoddy dialogs are unintelligible acting is abysmal and well kareena used to look like a wrestler now she looks like a starved wrestler hell you can slim down but you cannot gain gracebr br after spending three hours watching a movie i want to like it but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure br br please if you want to torture yourself go ahead watch this
6,this movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation women and performers both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in china this makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culturebr br the only problem i had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors performancebr br a welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies
1,first saw this gem from joe sarno way back when and i must say that after seeing it i could never forget jennifer welles at first i thought the film was moving a bit slower than i would expect for a sarno film but when jennifer made her entrance the first time i ever saw her anywhere i was sat up and took notice her presence in this film is hard to avoid and spices up every scene shes involved in ive seen most of the rest of sarnos films and the other films starring or featuring jennifer welles and i must say that this was both sarno and jennifer at their collective best sarnos direction in this film of domestic adult drama is superb and jennifer showed figuratively and literally an acting prowess that make this a must see costars rebecca brooke aka mary mendum and chris jordan both frequent costars of ms welles and also frequent stars of sarnos work turn in believable performances as a pair of adventurous yet normal housewives this film is sarno classic
7,sky captain may be considered an homage to comic books pulp adventures and movie serials but it contains little of the magic of some of the best from those genres one contributor says that enjoyment of the film depends on whether or not one recognizes the films influences i dont think this is at all true ones expectations of the filmsfiction and serials that captain pays tribute to were entirely different especially so for those who experienced those entertainments when they were children this film is almost completely devoid of the charm and magnetic attraction of those of course we know the leads will get into and out of scrapes but there has to be some tension and drama toward the climax of captain law and paltrow have ten minutes to prevent catastrophe and by the time they get down to five minutes they are walking not running toward their goal they take time out for long looks and unnecessary conversation and the contemplation of a fallen foe with 30 seconds left to tragedy of course one expects certain conventions to be included but a good director would have kept up some sense of urgencybr br one doesnt expect films like this to necessarily make sense one does expect them to be fun thrilling and to have some sense of interior logic captain has almost none remember when law and paltrow are being pursued by the winged creatures and they reach a huge chasm which they cross via a log bridge well how come they are perfectly safe from those creatures when they reach the other side they can fly the chasm itself means nothing to them the bridge is unnecessary for them so where is the escape if the land across the chasm is forbidden to the flying creatures the film made no effort to let us know how or why or even ifbr br i know that paltrow and law both of whom have given fine performances in the past were playing types but both were pretty flat only giovanni ribisi who showed himself capable of great nuance here and angelina jolie seemed to give any oomph to their roles although omid djalili seemed like he could have handled a little more if hed only been given the chance he did a pretty good job anyway considering how he was basically wastedbr br the film had a great look but there are so many ways in which cgi distracts cgi works best when it is used for the fantastical when it is used to create creatures who dont exist in nature or for scientific or magical spectacular when it is used to substitute for natural locations it disappoints there is no real sense of wonder a cgi mountain doesnt have any of the stateliness or sense of awe and foreboding that a real mountain does i know that the design of this film was quite deliberate and it wasnt necessarily supposed to look real but shouldnt it feel that way it just didnt br br as for the weak and clichd scripthomage is no excuse even so had the movie had some thrills and dramatic tension it might still have been enjoyable the last samurai was as predictable as the days of the week and i am no fan of tom cruise but it had everything that captain didnt most notably it drew the viewer into its world and made us accept its rules and way of being in a way that sky captain most definitely did notbr br id like to see a similar approach taken for films about comic book heroes of the 30s and 40s the original jay garrick flash or green lantern alan scott come to mind as being ripe for such treatment maybe the better more well known and fully realized characters that those character are would make for a much better film it would be hard to be worse
7,if this movie was about a fictional character the movie could stand on its own and be judged objectively unfortunately for the viewer the movie is based on facts that are shaded very unfairly toward ruben carter many of the smaller facts were disregarded carter was not number one contender at the time of the murders there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth but some of the larger facts like apparently being robbed of a decision to joey giardello because of racist judges is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape and completely disrespectful to giardello why hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who at best was in trouble and around trouble much more than any normal person should be was arrested multiple times for beating women is strange to me ruben carter was never by viewing his actions in the 60s and even now when he refuses to speak to his son a person that people can look up to everyone knows that jewison can direct and washington can act but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond me is hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all of their bio pics to make them believable heres a suggestion how about denzel playing a movie about himself now thats inspirational based on all of the inaccuracies in the movie i would suggest passing on this one

4,i have seen it  i like it melissa plays her part well it was actually believable my brother in law saw it with my sister  i and when i mentioned to my sister that i forgot it was based on a true story i had seen it a few years ago he said just because its on lifetime you think its true  both my sister  i were like it was so anyway i was wondering if anyone knew what murder it was or like who was really involved was because i want to prove it to him i love lifetime movies especially the ones that are true or just the ones that teach a good lesson i thought i saw something about it a week ago but i cant remember where any help would be appreciated
7,another comedy about a plucky little country struggling through the jungle of the modern for the forties global world with only native wit and pluck to guide them this is a fine entry in the ealing cannon terrythomas sparkles as usual in the lead as a feckless ministry man led to the brink of disaster when a nation he is supposedly in charge of starts attracting the interest of the world ian bannen makes a great romantic lead peter sellers puts in one of his quieter performances as a corrupt politico and the ubersuave john le mesurier plays against type as a rugged revolutionary leader lots of fun is had by all especially the viewer perhaps not in the very top echelon of ealing classics but pretty high up
6,american boy jesse took the train to vienna in order to take the plane for usa on the train he met a french girl celine although they met the first time they talked like good friends when the train stopped at vienna jesse begged celine to accompany him to have a tour on vienna then the romantic story unfoldedbr br at first they were cautious the funniest scene was their listening to cd in music store they peeked at each other though their eyes did not contact after indepth conversation they relationship became close then i saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their respective friend their deep love for each other was expressed completely by wordsbr br love is a strange thing when you really want it it will not come as you wished love needs mutual understanding without it love will not last long spiritual harmony is the most important for lovebr br excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the moviebr br one of the best romance movies 910
3,william powell is a doctor dealing with a murder and an exwife in the exmrs bradford also starring jean arthur eric blore and james gleason it seems that powell had chemistry going with just about any woman with whom he was teamed though he and myrna loy were the perfect screen couple the actor made a couple of other thin man type movies one with ginger rogers and this one with arthur both to very good effectbr br somehow one never gets tired of seeing powell as a witty debonair professional and the exmrs bradford is no exception the exmrs b has mr b served with a subpoena for back alimony and then moves back in to help him solve a mystery that shes dragged him into and this isnt the first time shes done that it almost seems as though there was a bradford film before this one or that this was intended to be the first of a series of films  mr b complains that his mysterywriter ex is constantly bringing him into cases this time a jockey riding the favorite horse in a raise mysteriously falls off the horse and dies right before the finish linebr br the solution of the case is kind of outlandish but its beside the point the point is the banter between the couple and the interference of the exmrs b jean arthur is quite glamorous in her role and very funny however with an actress who comes off as brainy as arthur does the humor seems intentional rather than featherbrained i suspect the writer had something else in mind  say the wacky side of carole lombard when arthur hears that the police have arrived she says ah its probably about my alimony ive been waiting for the police to take a hand in it its more of a rib to powell rather than a serious statement it still works well and it shows how a good actress can make a part her ownbr br definitely worth watching as william powell and jean arthur always were
6,in theodore rex poor whoopi goldberg is set up as a tough police cop who gets to work with a pathetic dinosaur on a case the movie tries to be funny and tries to make a story about abductions and more but it never works the movie is far from funny and the story is ridiculous i voted 110
7,an unexpected pleasure as i had heard nothing about this filmbr br shameful since it warrants having a wider audiencebr br a wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told although admittedly predictable in its resolution solidly acted by the principals beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the filmbr br my recent foray into chinese film shower the road home not one less has been an exciting one that i hope to continue exploring china and its people is an amazing canvas for filmmakers the king of masks can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent chinese filmbr br 
7,this film made john glover a star alan raimy is one of the most compelling character that i have ever seen on film and i mean that sport
0,this is a kind of genre thing meaning you either like the 1950s musicals or you dont if you do youll love this personally i prefer the 1930s and most of the 40s musicals with the dancing talents of astaire and rogers and eleanor powell bill robinson ruby keeler james cagney shirley temple and so forth but the songs of the 50s the slower dance numbers and the soapy melodramas of the decade all turn me offbr br this film is a caseinpoint the first song was okay but the next three did nothing for me by then the story didnt have much appeal either the presence of deborah kerr is another minus i dont think ive seen a movie she starred in that i liked including this one where the goody twoshoes english teacher she portrays spends half the movie threatening to leave siam i which she had br br however divorcing myself from likesanddislikes there is no denying this rogers and hammerstein production has a lot of appeal to many folks particularly those who liked the sound of music a decade later there are similarities in the rh musicals thus if you liked the julie andrews flick you should like this too br br this is a lavish production with yes a capital l this is the kind of bigproduction musicals you rarely saw after that generation you also get the dubbed singers unlike today where the actress isnt able to really sing so marnie nixon comes to rescue of kerr as she did with natalie wood in west side story and audrey hepburn in my fair lady br br yul brynner is king mongkut and is the stereotypical traditionalist the kind filmmakers always portray in a negative way he isnt progressive as the left wingers like the say but the education teacher kerr as anna leonowens will set him straight secularprogressives of today always place teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer however yul is good in this role and even employs some comedy along with his morebarkthanbite character justifiably he is the big star of this film brynner had magnetism even in the magnificent seven yul was the one cowboy who mesmerized the audiencebr br in summary its a fine movie for its day and millions of people enjoyed it ill leave it at that
6,there is a remark that one of heroines was raped on drunken rampage by russian soldiers which is completely untrue this movie should not be shown only because of thisbr br also there is a statement by someone that kgb prosecuted jews gypsies etc which is worse than nazis kgb was looking for so called zionist agents who were kgb believed imperialist agents this is totally different from targeting jewry as a whole nation as nazis did gypsies were never prosecuted kgb was political tool and used politically but from internationalist standpoint communists really did not distinguish between nationalitiesbr br whole movie stinks like fake main hero does not speak russian signs in berlin contains typographical errors kgb general looks totally phony some so called russian proverbs are totally made up and list goes on and onbr br not recommended to watch  this movie is full of lies and phony stuff go to good shepherd instead
7,at the time i am writing this i see out of over 15000 votes it has a 58 rating something is wrong with that picture personally i give it a 10 i can see a at the lowest or a possible if it was rated by people that see this movie for what it truly is it is a movie based on a comic book hero this movie won more than its share of awards won oscars another wins  26 nominations  right there tells me its better than a 58 some great acting from some very good actors some great special effects and in my opinion will be if not already a classic for years to come if youre looking for pure entertainment be sure to check out dick tracy definitely a movie you can watch more than a few times al pacino is great as big boy caprice
3,well not yet at leastbr br its not listed in the worst 100br br so lets all team up and put it in its rightful placebr br this is truly a bad movie and i liked ishtar 
3,i usually come on this website prior to going to the movies as i like to see what other people think of the movie i read many reviews which said thriller not a horror movie this prompted me to give this film a try i really must take issue with these thrillerhorror statements as it was neither i almost went and asked for my money back and if you lot of reviewers enjoyed this rubbishwell you must be easily pleased at the end of the movie the people behind me said out loud what a waste of time and i turned to them and replied  i couldnt have summed it up better i kept waiting for something to happenbut it didnt there was the potential for a lot of good scares or thrills if you like but none happened williams acted the part quite well but i felt he was short changed by a poor script which dithered around and went nowhere save your money folks this is a turkey which will be featuring at a dvd store bargain box near you in the very foreseeable future
0,fairly funny jim carrey vehicle that has him as a news reporter who temporarily gets the power of god and wrecks havoc carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a good time and jennifer aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also charming and affecting the story is predictible to the extreme but the cast including morgan freeman as god is great and makes the film worth catching grade b
1,i gave this more than a because i did think there were some moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and i the acting and the dialogue were mediocre and i must confess i came out feeling like i had been beaten over the head with the god this  god that and christ is our saviour stuff the movie and the story line did not need it if  as i am  you are a recovering catholic or christian avoid this one it will make you nauseous the movie did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been
0,when a small town is threatened by a child killer a lady police officer goes after him by pretending to be his friend as she becomes more and more emotionally involved with the murderer her psyche begins to take a beating causing her to lose focus on the job of catching the criminal not a film of high voltage excitement but solid police work and a good depiction of the faulty mind of a psychotic loser
1,i saw this movie at an advance screening and found it excellentbr br new york i love you is a true spin on a romance that explores clever funny and sometimes shocking situations around the human races most powerful emotionbr br the cast is huge a veritable oceans 11 with andy garcia ethan hawke shia labouf natalie portman bradley cooper and others they all give stand out performances in one way or anotherbr br thats not to mention that there is a whos who of directors interweaving stories in clever and interesting ways brett rattner shaka kapur natalie portman i mean wow this movie is not a straight ahead romance or romantic comedy even though it is both romantic and funny it also has serious stories and notes but thats good in my opinion go see it for yourself and reply to my review i want to hear what others have to say
5,contains spoilersbr br hollow man is probably the weakest movie that paul verhoeven director of great movies like total recall starship troopers and robocop has ever made br br thats probably not his fault for some reason verhoeven got stuck with an utterly mediocre script and he made the best of it br br the first part of this movie is rather good with lots of cynical jokes great special effects and even skunk anansie on the soundtrack unfortunately the movie falls flat in the second part were it degenerates into a standard slasher movie or maybe a very bad alien clone the ending is especially ridiculous spoiler as kevin bacon keeps coming back to life after a number of incidents that should in the logical sense of the word have killed him spoiler and the entire thing is quite shallow indeed the subject of becoming invisible is never fully investigatedbr br but all in all verhoeven manages to stay well above average with this movie br br 12 out of  stars
2,i now that these days some people want see a movie without movie styling so much dogma lars von watchosky brothers are changed what we expect in a movie perhaps casomai is noonemoreindependentnonamerican movie the movie take all movies resources and language to tell us a simple history about love and marriage but much more  fully of views lectures and let you thinking  and im sure you cant fell boried any second of a long 116 minutes i calculate that dont have a single scene longer that o 12 minutes
5,just saw the movie this past weekend i am upset and disappointed with it basically the movie tells you that immigrants the ones from former soviet union especially come to this country bring everyone they can with them from the old country and invade and take over what americans have been working for which is a very wrong way of looking at immigration and a much worse way of telling people about it thats the main thing another thing the overall writing directing and filming is on the level of village amateurs the actors did pretty well but it wasnt up to them save this bunch of crap a few jokes were funny but most were bad and cheesy couldnt wait to get out of the theater want my money back
7,like freddys revenge this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and doesnt go to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it basically alice from number is pregnant and her baby is haunted by freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends this has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wisecracks are quite poor so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy br br  ive not alot to say about this its moderately interesting to see the characters of alice and dan returning from four but not worth watching a movie over uninspriring and unenjoyable possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series
2,i used to watch this show when i was a little girl when i think about it i only remember it vaguely if you ask me it was a good show two things i remember vaguely are the opening sequence and theme song in addition to that everyone was ideally cast also the writing was very strong the performances were topgrade too i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode before i wrap this up id like to say that ill always remember this show in my memory forever even though i dont think ive seen every episode now in conclusion if some network ever brings it back i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good
0,i saw paris je taime because a friend really wanted to see it so i went along with him going in i was indifferent about the film but leaving the theater i really regretted wasting hours of my life sitting through this tepid production the stories are almost completely forgettable except for the fact that most of them were awful what do gena rowlands and ben gazzara have to do with paris the endless parade of american actors most definitely gave this french film a remarkably nonfrench feel the clichs about paris were endless yes most of them were playing with clichs about paris but by spending so much time making fun of french clichs they directly and regrettably promoted them once more yes paris is the city of love we get itbr br the worst segments were the one directed by wes craven oscar wilde the one with nick nolte the mime one the worst the hair products one the one with juliette binoche willem dafoe as a cowboy in the middle of paris the vampire one when i think of paris i think of elijah wood the one with natalie portman which really looked like a mentos commercial and it was stupid the blind young man should know portman was just playing a part when she called him on and on it went it felt endlessbr br i didnt like the coen bros one as well it really plays with those parisien clichs but i didnt find it funny just annoying the gus van sant one was interesting but it was so slight and the punchline was obvious that it barely registeredbr br there were only two successful segments and they were the one about the immigrant nanny who leaves her baby at a kindergarten only to babysit a baby for a rich woman nice irony there and the segment about the african who is stabbed its the best segment in the whole film but this segment has nothing to do with paris the story could have taken place in any city around the worldbr br the last segment the one with the chubby middle aged woman was sorta interesting too but the underlying tone was bad they wanted to celebrate her limited grasp of french but the segment came off as being condescendingbr br the whole project felt forced and uninspired almost like the french government sponsored this film to promote tourism all in all with only about 10 to 15 minutes of interesting stuff paris je taime was an awful cinematic experience
7,im disappointed at the lack of posts on this surprising and effective little film jordi moll probably best known for his role as diego in ted demmes blow writes directs and starsbr br i wont give away any plot points as the movie at least for me was very exciting having not known anything about it if you have a netflix account or have access to a video store that would carry iti highly recommend it its a crazy fun and sometimes very thought provoking creationbr br molls direction is quite impressive and shows a lot of promisebr br unpredictable with amazing imagery and a great lead performance spoken in beautiful spanish no somos nadie god is on air is an amazing film you can show off to your friendsbr br see it
1,this movie is so bad it hurts the car doing 30 mph when its supposed to go 100 the shift lever thats stuck in park the nurse that drives for almost hours with the cell phone on the shouldercant any of the morons take this damn phone theres nothing credible in this crap i would be ashamed to be seen in a movie like this
0,these were over 80 minutes of semi unexpected boredom first i was wondering how it is possible to produce something like that then reaching 70th minute i was convincing myself that its only a few more minutes and i lasted to the very end which im kinda proud of as i consider watching this movie as a great test for humans patience and crap tolerance was it worth watching at all well as i wrote above if you want to test yourself give it a try and if youre strong willed enough you may even last to the end the movie lacks coherence and characters seem to have no common sense at all all happenings in the movie you can be sure you saw somewhere before and they seem to be put in this movie just to fill the film reel
0,this is a bit of a first for me the first time i have ever been disappointed in a tim burton film pota isnt a bad film great sets costumes and the odd great performance but it could have been made by any offtheshelf hollywood director the pacing was very odd the last third was just spent waiting for the film to end by myself and the cast tim roth was excellent probably the only pleasure in the film come back tim
5,she may have an oscar and a golden globe but this film shows why she also is a perennial razzie nominee to do a film that is so bad must be an indication that she needs money she could do ads on why you shouldnt talk on a cell phone while driving especially at night on the way to a crowded mallbr br susan montford should stick to producing shoot em up  as she is not very good as a writerdirectorbr br she is accosted by four thugs in the mall parking lot and the first thing they do is tell her they have a gun what does she do she starts pushing and cursing them like she knows martial arts or something she manages to get away but gets lost in the forest after crashing why didnt she run to someones house we get four thugs with guns chasing a lady with a toolbox of course their guns are no match for her wrench ha of course she also has a tire iron and a screwdriver those poor thugsbr br now shes home for christmas  and she brought a gun
3,trot out every stereotype and misrepresentation youve heard about semidevout mormons and youll see theyve all starred in this ridiculous excuse for a film finally kurt hales fortunes have changed thank goodness and hopefully it will be a long while before we see any of his features in theatersbr br the cinematography was amateurish i think they used a camcorder for some of the basketball scenes the plot was limp and very unfunny you really didnt understand why anyone did anything it was like i had sand in my eyes and a 300pound lady was sitting on my face it was that painfulbr br the only reason i didnt give this movie a negative rating was because the scale wont let me

7,a deplorable social condition triggers off the catastrophe an impoverished giovanna has ended up in the gutter but still has an ace up her sleeve beauty and youth bragana a fatbellied gas station tenant who has been getting on in years picks her up from the street and offers her bed and home together with his clumsy affection but the physical contact that giovanna is now exposed to only gives her feelings of disgust and consequently she does not see a benefactor in him but a tormentor whom she has to get rid ofbr br the arrival of gino a young migrant worker finally provides her the longedfor opportunity and you dont have to ask her twice at the very first encounter she gives him the feeling of being physically desired and a little later she lets him seduce her without offering any resistancebr br the developping partnership has to submit to the strict rules drawn up by giovanna though ginos yearning for freedom is suppressed his desire to leave the place with giovanna and start a new life far away from the fatso is pushed aside giovanna aims at another goal to get bragana killed to inherit and in addition to that to collect the insurance premium in her hands gino degenerates into a selfsacrificing tool being completely at the mercy of this woman he turns into a coldblooded killerbr br but in contrast to giovanna he questions the committed crime on a moral level the very taking over of braganas place which includes the sleeping in the bed of a dead man causes a deep loathing of himself and later after he has found out about the forthcoming payment of the insurance money and seems to see through giovannas cunningly devised plan he also executes a physical separation from his lover and finds comfort in the arms of a prostitutebr br if viscontis film ended at this point it could easily be classified as a condemnatory portrait of a cool calculating and unscrupulous woman with a slight touch of social criticism but then the last sequences make this carefully built construct of ideas collapse at last giovanna feels remorseful about what she has done and by the uncompromising revelation of her innermost feelings she succeeds in inflaming anew ginos love her violent death by an absurd road accident then does not only leave him helpless at the mercy of an arbitrary fate it also affects us while we realize that none of the acting characters is to be made responsible for their disaster the culprit is just the state of a society that determines the way of the individual unalterably right from the startbr br 
0,what reviewers and mst3k left out is the best part and only memorable scene of this otherwise dreadful movie there is a very good rapeintheshower scene committed by the bad guy ben gazzara lookalike on maria as mentioned killed later through tjs ineptitude perhaps rape is too strong a word prison mating ritual may be more appropriate the background behind this chance yet forced meeting is the mobster who is hiding ben gazzara introduces him to the girls hanging out at his pool the 30ish blonde disses him but our villain must be quite smitten by her because the courtship is on at that point his first move is to attempt drowning her until his mafia don benefactor tells him to knock it off kind of like the girl in high school you didnt like but still wanted to have carnal knowledge of anyway lets just say he catches up with her in the cabana later

3,oh wow i saw this film at the irish international film fleadh in manhattan on 12 march 2000 both stars were in attendance and were available for questions afterward what a gorgeous film although set in ireland amid catholicprotestant antagonism the story could have happened anywhere between any two groups of people who hate each other the horror of how quickly people can get carried away when they are given a chance to vent their hate and anger was woven beautifully with a moving love story drizzled with humor and fun if this one does not get picked up in the usa it would truly be most unfortunatebr br as for the stars and supporting playersfirst rate they call orla brady the irish meryl streep i heard it is my opinion that she is better than meryl streep they should be calling meryl the american orla brady and liam cunninghams steady and powerful portrayal of a simple and private man sucked into a political war was brilliantbr br see this movie
2,though not in the whole film andy griffith again plays his role best in this cbs tvmovie the plot is easygriffiths character dies and his last wish is that his wife and kids scatter his ashes is the place he named mountains somewhere though it will never be seen on tv and never be released on video if you do get the chance to watch thistake it
0,this film has the kernel of a really good story the work of the men and women of the coast guard especially in the north pacific is the stuff of heroes and legends this film mucks up a good story with three endings none satisfying a couple of unneeded and pointless bar fights and two alleged romantic relationships that have as much spark as dead campfire the rescue scenes are great  even if the computer generation is hokey and the scenarios are pretty unreal  but the backstory is lame and disappointing costner is good  especially his hand acting watch for it ashton kutcher is flat but not terrible the main female characters are one dimensional the best female is one of the coast guard sailors in the rescue center and shes on camera for about two minutes in the whole film it could have been an excellent film  and costner needs one
7,i got all excited when i saw the ads for this movie because i recently read the book and really enjoyed it the movie however did not meet my expectations having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies the characters didnt seem to fit very well with the book the direction was weak i had a hard time getting into the characters there wasnt a real connection with the viewer about what was going on the dialog didnt explain adequately what was happening it just seemed slapped together and rushed through all in all i was very disappointed with the movie i suppose if you havent read the book it might be ok by itself at the very least it might entice you to read the book which youll probably enjoy morebr br 
3,as seems to be the general gist of these comments the film has some stunning animation i watched it on bluray but it really falls short of any real depthbr br firstly the characters are all pretty dull i got a hint of a kind of laputa situation between agito toola and the main antagonist shunack however maybe my mind wanderd and this was wishful thinking laputa being my favourite anim original engilsh dub the characters are not really lovable either and as mentioned in another post they fall in love exceptionally quickly leaving poor old minka jealous and rejected she loves agito who seems oblivious of this however she promptly seems to forgive toola at the end with no explanation for the change of heart other than it makes the ending a little bit more happy br br there is also a serious lack of explanation like who are the druids really are they people and who are the weird womengirls who seem to hang out with them and run the forest there is nothing explaining why they are there and how they can give regular humans superpowers the plants coming from the moon still does not fill in the blanks about this it is almost like a weird version of the day of the triffidsbr br and who does call toola why bother with this if it wont be explainedbr br i really wanted to like this film but i found the plot no where near as deep as a film like ghost in the shell or having any real character like those of miyazaki i do not resent watching it but i do sort of wish i hadnt bought it my advice give it a go if you have a couple of hours to spare but borrow it or buy it cheap perhaps if your new to anim films and dont have much to go by you will enjoy it it certainly is visually pleasing
7,ahista ahista is one little small brilliant i started watching it and at the beginning i got a little bored since the pacing was slow and the main idea of one guy meeting a girl who is lost was not really new but as the film went on i started getting increasingly and gradually engaged by the film the fantastic writing and the charming romance the film was extremely simple and natural and after some time i felt i was watching a real documentation of one guys life theres one very good reason the film got this feel and its the fresh talent called abhay deol he is extremely convincing as the simple kindhearted and struggling ankush whose new love motivates him to make amends and fight for a better life throughout the film he is presented as an ordinary mischievous prankster but also as a helping and loving person who like anyone else will do anything to protect his love deol portrays all the different shades of his character whether positive or negative naturally and with complete easebr br shivam nairs direction is very good his depiction of the life of people in the rural neighbourhood is excellent but what gets to be even more impressive is his portrayal of ankushs relationships with the different people who surround him including his friends and his love interest megha who he is ready to do anything for i also immensely liked the way nair portrayed his interaction with his friends loud and plump mother whom he calls khala aunty he likes to drive her crazy and annoy her on every occasion yet we see that she occupies a very special place in his heart and is like a motherfigure to him as evidenced in several scenes except for abhay the rest of the cast performed well though soha ali khan did not stand out according to me she was good and had some of her mothers charm the actors who played ankushs friends were very good as was the actress who played ankushs khalabr br apart from the performances the films writing was outstanding the dialogues were sort of ordinary yet brilliant and the script was also fantastic thats mainly because despite a notsonew story it was never overdone or melodramatic and there were no attempts to make it look largerthanlife the films biggest weakness was himesh reshammiyas uninspiring music which was unsuitable for this film otherwise ahista ahista was a delightful watch and it got only better with every scene the concept may not be new but the film manages to look fresh and becomes increasingly heartwarming as the story goes by the ending was bittersweet kind of sad yet optimistic in short this movie really grows on you slowly and this can be easily attributed to the wonderful writing the moving moments the charming romance the realistic proceedings and of course abhay deols memorable performance
7,for the life of me i cannot get why they would want to make a movie about the jerry springer show its so incrediably trashy some ways sadly its a guilty pleasure we all have to admit that weve seen at least one episode its part of our pop culture i saw this on usa recently its pretty bad i will admit that jerry does a horrible job of what i think he meant as acting or something like it jamie pressley is in it shes playing herself basically all she needed was her lover boy kid rock it wouldve been perfect then so i would recommend skipping ringmaster just watch the jerry springer show its more enjoyable than thisbr br 210
5,i felt this film  throughout i waas impressed with russell crowes talent in developing his relationship with lillie such a typical aussie blend of softly softly approach a bit self depreciating and very persistent really loved the cinematography and direction pace was just right and the portrayals of nearly all characters was impressivebr br gosh didnt russells talent even in 1993 shine  and i have yet to see gladiator
0,i had never heard of larry fessenden before but judging by this effort into writing and directing he should keep his day job as a journeyman actor like many others on here i dont know how to categorize this film it wasnt scary or spooky so cant be called a horror the plot was so wafer thin it cant be a drama there was no suspense so it cant be a thriller its just a bad film that you should only see if you were a fan of the blair witch project people who liked this film used words like ambiguity and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that wasnt there like the blair witch people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that it was terrifying this movie actually started off well with the family meeting the locals after hitting a deer it looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next 45 minutes well over half the film nothing happened the family potted about their holiday home which was all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining it was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie finally when something does happen its not even clear how the father was shot how he dies the nurse said his liver was only grazed and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with 3rd grade special effects the film is called wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way the film ends all muddled and leaves you very unsatisfied i would have bailed out with 15 minutes to go but i wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself it didnt
7,spirit is a unique and original look at western life from the point of view of a wild horse and native americans the film focuses on the friendships and perils that a wild horse spirit encounters during his lifebr br very well done in the presentation using the technology available today to deliver stunning visuals that are breathtaking in their depth and realismbr br the music is fantastic with songs by bryan adams and music by hans zimmer who also was responsible for the extremely popular music from the 1994 disney hit the lion kingbr br the story is not very deep but the fact that it isnt quite as indepth as some movies doesnt in my opinion detract from the film as a wholebr br an excellent film which i enjoyed immensely and that is suitable for all the family not one to be missed 1010
2,everything about this film was terrible to start with this film had a pretty good cast and i find it impossible to make such a great cast into the biggest disaster to the gangster film genre ever the sound track was like one of a very bad slap stick comedy it had this music through the whole film and it started to get quite irritatingbr br please please please please please do not inflict yourself with this disaster you will only be hurt
2,i literally fell asleep times watching this movie granted its shakespeare and that takes a certain mindset to be interested or not but this movie exceeds any barrier of long soliloquies and what not that may prevent many from just not caring about a shakespeare based storybr br the largest roadblock to this production is the complete flatness of the characters often during characters interacting its nearly difficult to distinguish whos lines are whos granted i believe this movie is dubbed in english certainly they couldve obtained voice actors which couldve added a bit more drama to these classic literary linesbr br it would be difficult to rate this movie greater than although perhaps thats based on prejudices of perhaps age and what would seem a very low budget still its absolutely painful and boring if you insist on hamlet do yourself a favor and read the book again 110
2,the minute you give an art film 110 you have people baying for your ignorant halfassed artistically retarded blood i wont try and justify how i am not an aesthetically challenged retard by listing out all the art house cinema i have liked or mentioning how i gave some unknown cult classic a 1010 all i ask is that someone explain to me the point purpose and message of this filmbr br here is how i would summarize the film opening montage of three unrelated urban legends depicting almost absurd levels of coincidence this followed by in a nutshell to save you hours of pain the following  a childrens game show host dying of lung cancer tries to patch things up with his cokeaddicted daughter who he may or may not have raped when she was a child and who is being courted by a bumbling police officer with relationship issues while the gameshows star contestant decides that he doesnt want to be a failed child prodigy a fate which has befallen another one of the game show contestants from the 60s who we see is now a jobless homosexual in love with a bartender with braces and in need of money for corrective oral surgery while the game shows producer himself dying of lung cancer asks his male nurse to help him patch up with the son he abandoned years ago and who has subsequently become a womanizing self help guru even as mr producers second wife suffers from guilt pangs over having cheated a dying man and oh eventually it rains frogs you read correctly and i am sparing you the unbelievably long and pointless literally rambling monologues each character seems to come up with on the fly for no rhyme or reason other than possibly to make sure the film crosses hours and becomes classified as a modern epic br br you are probably thinking that i could have done a better job of summarizing the movie and in turn of not confusing you if i had written the damn thing a little more coherently maybe in a few sentences instead of just one well now you know how i feel
0,masayuki suo who directed this fine film is on a role after the decent fancy dance and the classic in japan anyway collegesumo comedy shiko funjatta suo has followed his own huge footsteps with a smashing successbr br the story is engaging we both laugh often naoto takenaka is hilarious as he is in suos two previous films and really root for the characters but to me the big bonus is the look this movie gives the viewer into japanese society  real life in japan suo has a knack for showing reallife activities with entertaining flair the result is a movie that will pull you in make you laugh make you think and both entertain you and give you insight into todays japanbr br also look for the the main actors from shiko funjatta as they all appear again in various roles from supporting characters takenaka to short cameos many
2,while it does crack the odd good joke the humour is generally quite dry with members of the panel frequently pulling faces or resorting to coarse language and waiting on the crowd to applaud lame enough jokesbr br unlike what an other comment says i dont think this is the best rte have ever made its really dry and sarcastic sarcasm is the lowest form of wit there are few truly funny intelligent gags that would make you genuinely laugh out loud people seem to be convinced by the comedians well known names rather than by judging the quality of the gags which arent really that good overall its mediocre with some good laughs to be had but often it can be fairly mediocre its not as good as jasper carrot or dave allens stuff i find benny hill funnier
7,i was surprised at how fascinating this movie was the performances were extremely good especially by rea as the compassionate nononsense detectivebr br despite a low budget no big fx or flashy camerawork citizen x somehow manages to surpass the majority of similar big hollywood films by just telling the storybr br true stories tend to end with a whimper rather than a bang and thats the case here but apart from that this is a highly recommended detective yarn
6,ive spent years looking for a copy of this film16mmdvdvhs so i could show it to my kids the movie is funny and spike and the members of his band show why they were the best musicians in the business they had to be that good to play that demented i like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all agesbr br the movie is about a turn of the century firehouse with a crew of misfits that are firemen and the department band when not fighting the fires theres the usual running gags plus the mayhem of spike jones and his orchestra also comedy relief provided by comedian buddy hackett and straightman hugh obrien
1,i bought this video at walmarts bin i think i overpaid in the 1940s bela lugosi made a long string of 3rdrate movies for small studios in this case monogramthe ones who made most of the bowry boys films while the wretchedness of most of these films does not approach the level of awfulness his last films achieved ed wood classics such as bride of the monster and plan from outer space they are nonetheless poor films and should be avoided by all but the most diehard fansbr br i am an old movie junkie so i gave this a try besides a few of these lesser films were actually pretty goodjust not this onebr br lugosi is what else a mad scientist who wants to keep his rather bizarre and violent wife alive through a serum he concocts from young brides they never really explained why it had to be brides or why it must be women or even what disease his wife hadso you can see that the plot was never really hashed out at allbr br anyways a really annoying female reporter a lois lane type without jimmy olsen or superman wants to get to the bottom of all these apparent murders in which the bodies were stolen so she follows some clues all the way to the doorstep of lugosi lugosis home is complete with his crazed wife a female assistant and two strange people who are apparently the assistants sons an ugly hunchbacked sex fiend and a dwarf naturally this plucky reporter faints repeatedly throughout the filmapparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand eventually the maniacs all diemostly due to their own hands and all is well at the conclusion the reporter and a doctor she just met decide to marry and naturally the reporters dumb cameraman faints when this occurs if you havent noticed theres a lot of fainting in this film or maybe because it was such a slow and ponderous film they just fell asleep
5,the movie seemed to appeal me because of the new type of pokemon celebi but the plot was out of course and didnt have as an interest as the other movies it was a waste of money and time the same corny humor and cliche bad guys the movie was of no use to make if you wanted to make pokemon famous the movie should better not associated with animes such as dragonballz digimon or yugioh the drawing and settings are of no level rising to the standards of original anime it is a shame even to talk about this movie i bet pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and give up on pokemon digimon is more of an anime and doesnt fall anywhere close to pokemonits second movie is coming out late 2002
0,fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately blood surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid redundant pulphorror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal crocodile directed by a disappointing tobe hooper and lake placid blood surf is every bit as bad as these other films and  on top of that  it likes to exaggerate tremendously the saltwatercrocodile supposedly is 90 years old over 30 ft long  and it kills for fun during the film he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surferdudes  dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a sharkcongested area the only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location even though its a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this the lagoons and nature looks marvelous every other aspect is simply disastrous theres a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable the dialogues are downright painful to listen to you wont believe some of the lines these actors have to say i know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but i hope for their own sake theyre not that stupid early in the film one of the characters refers to jaws as being a mechanical toy but the croc here looks at least 10 times less real than spielbergs great white shark the visual effects in blood surf are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress i wont say too much about the acting since its secondary in flicks like this the girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast you guessed right blood surf is a very bad film so bad it becomes fun again but funny for a whole other reason than james hickox intended

0,interesting mix of comments that it would be hard to add anything constructive to however ill try this was a very good action film with some great set pieces youll note i specified the genre i didnt snipe about the lack of characterisation and i didnt berate the acting enjoy if for what it is people a well above average action film i could go on but ive made my comment
1,spoilersbr br in the words of jeanpaul sartre hell is other people in the odd couple jack lemmon and walter matthau demonstrate just how accurate this can be as felix ungar and oscar madison lemmon and matthau respectively create two good friends who decide to live together as the two begin to slowly grow more and more frustrated with each other the laughs come thick and fast before felix departs leaving oscar a changed and more cleanly individualbr br jack lemmon as ungar is absolutely superb as the neurotic cleaning obsessed divorcee coping with life as a single man walter matthau in contrast to lemmons character is equally as good as the slobbish sports writer who simply wants to play poker to earn money for his child benefitsbr br lemmon and matthau are magnificant in their selected parts to some degree dependent upon the beautiful script by neil simon and simultaneously because they work well as a team as two friends who are inherently different in lifestyles although similar in relationships with exwives and children these two late great actors create a partnership which is practically impossible to recreate so great in fact that the world screamed out so much for something similar that two years before matthaus death and three before lemmons the characters were reunited in an inferior sequel this idea whilst following hollywoods irritating obsession with sequels might have worked to a certain degree but at the same time it could never come close to replicating the genius of this original filmbr br ultimately its not really possible to say anything else with simons amazing script filled with humour and laughter the creators of this film were already onto a hit the casting of jack lemmon and walter matthau as felix ungar and oscar madison though is the most important part of this film the odd couple with its traditional soundtrack which even gained a tribute in the simpsons its excellent script and its genius leading men is a tribute to cinema and a feature for history to remember
0,walter matthau and george burns just work so well together the acidity of willy with the perplexed amnesic al is a mixture made in heaven the scene when they meet again in willys flat is a gem and the final scene rounds up the film to perfection walter matthau gives a superb performance as the irascible semiretired comedian as only he can the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatics coupled with his general misunderstanding of what is going on form a great characterization george burns timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film his calm aplomb with desert dry replies are memorable watch for the scene near the end when al and his daughter ask something of the spanish caretaker and als reaction  priceless
7,possible spoilersbr br someone once asked dr seuss if they could secure the movie rights to his 1957 christmas classic how the grinch stole christmas he turned them down insisting that no one could do better than the marvelous chuck jones tv special from 1966 also in mind perhaps was his bitter experience writing the script to 1953s the 5000 fingers of dr t when the good dr died in 1991 his widow audrey geisel still obstinately refused to sell the movie rights but with the commonplace use of cgi effects becoming a reality mrs geisel had a change of heart universal made her a generous offer she accepted she also accepted the casting of jim carrey as the title character supposedly she was satisfied with the final result well mrs geisel that makes one of usbr br the film was given a 123000000 budget which is more than even heavens gate cost including the adjustment for inflation which obviously went towards the very elaborate makeup set design and special effects which are underminedbr br somewhat by the rather hazy cinematography unfortunately it seems that none of that money was set aside to get a better script than what jeffrey price and peter s seaman scribes of who framed roger rabbit which made much betterbr br use of a high budget turned in whereas the tv special was a trim 26 minutes without commercials this film tries to fill a running time of 105 minutes with more background information about the grinch it turns out that as a child he was the subject of ridicule including an especially humiliating experience one christmas at the age of eight so it turns out that everything that ails our poor mr grinch is directly because of the whos trouble is it seems like a rather long 105 minutes with too much dead wood clogging up the story that might not seem so bad if only the grinch were a little morewell grinchy the character that dr seuss wrote and chuck jones later animated was a sly fox whose slick attempts to hijack the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change and exponential growth of heart carreys grinch is a loud hyperactive oaf and at times a thug who when made the holiday cheermeister trashes the whoville town square in angerbr br hopefully the scenery tasted as good as it looked this undermines the scripts attempt to make the grinch more sympathetic with all the whos down in whoville so unsympathetic at least in this interpretationbr br the whoville of dr seusss vision was a small town populated by honest folk who knew in their hearts the true meaning of christmas the whoville of the movie is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled selfish materialistic ninnies an obvious attempt to comment on american consumerism this is offensivelybr br hypocritical inasmuch as the film industry has benefitted greatly from american consumerism and as this film contributed to it with a huge merchandisingbr br campaignbr br the film also expands and redefines the character of cindy lou who a small but crucial character in the original the innocent twoyearold waif who walked in on this spurious santa is now older and wiser constantly questioning the false values of the whos and trying to understand the grinchs point of view her one major scene from the original is reenacted making it seem out of character shebr br seems to be the only one who would ever know that christmas is more than just gifts and decorations thus making her a completely different and more annoying characterbr br those who celebrate christmas should sooner accept a lump of coal in theirbr br stockings on the morning of december 25 than a copy of this overlong overacted excruciatingly tedious hamhanded crude attempt to turn the childrens classic into a feature film it proves once and for all that darkness vulgaritybr br manipulation and heavyhandedness are inadequate substitutes for charm wit sincerity and heart the folks at universal should get down on their collective knees and thank god that this truly bilious 123 million stink bomb grossed 260 million domestically or theyd not be here today furthermore it made mike myers the cat in the hat possible
0,the premise of this anime series is about bread of all things to base a plot on i truly laughed the main character has a special bread making power that he was born with and he goes off to bread baking school i wish it were available on dvd and it doesnt matter if its subtitled or dubbed  its that good even the theme song alone is funny at one point in the theme song theres an africanjapanese man with an afro on horseback wielding a french baguette as if it were a samurai sword these images will not make sense unless you see the anime youll laugh until your sides hurt it is definitely the most unique anime i have seen thus far
0,i would just like it to be known that i do not often rate movies below a i was originally very excited to see this movie its numerous trailer bumps on tv for several months made me reaally want to see this movie so the other night when i saw that it was available on fearnet on demand i got some popcorn and sat down to watch the filmbr br the storyline seemed intriguing enough  some dude is butchering unsuspecting people on the subway theres a photographer obsessed with the missing people where are they going whats happening to them one day the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken and becomes obsessed with the butcher following him around yada yada the film had a way of sucking you in even though the plot was highly predictable oh no its dark look out behind you i say quite bored with the cheap thrillsbr br the plot even though predictable was intriguingthat is until the end this was good until the end then it just got silly says jack_skellington_freke on the message boards and i fully agree and here come the spoilersbr br see i was hoping it was some mad killer some psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism no it was some secret society keeping creatures alive for centuries woo how original how unrealistic how dullbr br 310 come on lionsgate youve had amazing films but this one sunk
2,if i only had one camera that was accidentally glued to the floor enough film for only one take of each shot and then lost all that film and had to scrounge up some bucks to buy a few digital video tapes and was forced to make an over2hour movie about the french revolution and also didnt have any sets and had to have my 4yearold autistic son paint the backgrounds and also the only actors i could find were the people who didnt make the auditions of that years soap opera and i was also forced to not use any music in the entire film and also the zoom function on the camera didnt work except for one time when it accidentally started zooming in and couldnt stop oh and if i hated my audience then i might make something kind of like this awful yet mistakenly hilarious hellworthy waste of time the almost grand looking but completely fake looking backdrops reminded me of some of george lucas latest creations which made it so much more disappointing because through the whole movie there was that little glimmer of hope in the back of my mind that the film would climax in a lightsaber duelspace laser battle i dont mean to spoil the movie for those who havent seen it but thats not how it ends the only thing i can think of that wasted more time than watching this movie was writing this review peace
7,they must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the hollywood bus station they then fill in the blanks and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived you know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot four young boys playing in grainy slow motion accompanied by voice over narration next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion once theyre grown its easy to spot the writerdirector among the four hes the quiet contemplative longhaired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants this means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from hickville to hollywood only theres no writing or directing talent on display here and if you still cant figure out which one he is heres a hint the auteur and his character have the same middle name it took over an hour to figure out that these twentysomething men were supposed to still be in high school what looked like a prison was apparently a high school the warden turned out to be the principal once more the poor misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement murder and pillage but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father how about hitting back kid like you do everyone else numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose howlingly bad dialogue many scenes badly out of focus cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience overacting in the extreme and if you dont quite get the selfimportant speeches or the slowmotion scenes just listen to the overbearing music it will clue you in and what youre supposed to feel poor marisa ryan must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films the biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies run over puppies chained to a tree rob and steal all the while complaining about their sad sorry lives but if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college yeah thats the ticket why is it that every twentysomething filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important so interesting that the world cant wait to see it onscreen if this movie is as autobiographical as it seems then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive warrants
2,good western filmed in the rocky arizona wilds lots of tough guys throughout coberns character seemed to rock back and forth between a raging psycho and a laid back type several holes appeared in the picture but not enough to offset it being exciting and worth seeing one really dumb scene shows heston emptying 45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire a to gather that much gunpowder he would have needed a pack mule to carry the ammo b the grass was obviously dry why not just drop a match on it and let er rip
5,before i watched this tv movie i did not know much about one of my favorite actresses after watching it i realized how sad lucille balls life really was it had its great moments too but i didnt realize how sad it was this movie was very good and told the story of the beloved lucille ball very well i highly reccommend it
0,dick foran and peggy moran who were so good together in the mummys hand return for this very minor universal horror offering but this time instead of having wallace ford as the comedic sidekick babe we get fuzzy knight substituting as a silly buddy named stuff but the results are nowhere near as charming and the scare level is virtually nilbr br dick is a businessman who gets the idea of spearheading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside a spooky old castle peggy is one of the gang who comes along for the ride but there is a tall and skinny john carradine lookalike in a black cape and big hat known as the phantom who crashes the party in pursuit of the buried fortune himselfbr br this phantom is not very mysterious and no effort is made to even try and keep his rather average guy face in the shadows to create any tension or spookiness its always nice to see perky moran but otherwise you can chalk this up as one of universals instantly forgettable misfires
7,invasion of the star creatures would definitely be in the so bad its good category if the film wasnt quite so sexist or racist that it is such just makes it plain badbr br it has the same kind of hardline stereotypical sexism that you saw in queen of outer space and the kind of racist stereotypes in this instance native americans that you would normally find in thirties  forties bwesterns in terms of being nonfunny the same walkingthroughthecave gag is repeated well over ten times during the course of this fairly short movie ray does do one good impression of jimmy cagney but cant make it work for two impressions of cagney in a row nor handle a peter lorre when he tries it there really arent any production values to speak of as the star creatures make the roman from robot monster or tor johnson in plan from outer space look like creations of industrial light and magicbr br this film was definitely one of a vanguard of what you would have to call early independent cinemanot artsy enough for those theaters and not good enough for anything but the last feature of an allnight driveinbr br

7,for the record i am not affiliated with the production in any waybr br hidden frontier is probably the star trek fan film with the most episodes produced to date over seasons this is the last they have produced some 50 or so episodesbr br this is no mean feat on almost no budget and everyone volunteering their time and energybr br by their own admission the earlier seasons do not have as good production qualities as later ones but as they progress the effects green screen work and acting all improvebr br i did find it difficult to dip into so started from the beginning and watched all the way through hf benefits from story arcs just like all the best sci fi and dovetails nicely into the star trek universe in which it is set characters and relatives from the original series have been brought into the stories and add a lot to the feel of the stories sometimes improving on the characters over the originalbr br the whole experience includes an excellent web site blooper reels a high membership forum which is frequented by many of the actors and production staff and a weekly chatbr br if you are looking for high definition high budget productions this is probably not for youbr br if you are looking for continued adventures in the star trek universe with stories that does star trek credit and makes you think this is the one
0,although nothing can compare to vampires vs zombiesin any realm of film making i will attempt to judge this moviebr br firstly the special effects were breathtaking when there was an explosion on the television screen i thought my entire house was going to explode and when automatic machine guns were fired i thought the shells were landing on the floor right next to me simply stunning my friendsbr br but the scene when the jack black soundalike is giving the worst monologue i have ever heard i nearly killed myself but dont worry since he was getting blazed in the movie he can pass his awful acting off on i must be high seriously he must have watched himself mindlessly babbling about noncongruent thoughts that make absolutely no sense and just added that he must be high to justify his awful acting well if you can say that to excuse terrible acting then if you talked to the writers directors executive producers sponsors you will probably get the same responseseriouslybr br with a production team called shockorama i was shocked i didnt place a sawedoff shotgun in my mouth and ended my life after this shockingly terrible excuse for a movie was playedbr br if you want to see this movie then you should be murdered br br yours trulybr br the general
2,this is one of the few episodes if not the only one with an indisputable error in its storytelling while handling the ralphie situation christopher states that he has heard about pieomys death in the fire accident this is an important detail because in this context it is quite obvious that christopher knows from the beginning that tony is the one who must have killed ralphie there is however no way chris could have heard about the accident who should have told him and when by the time he is torn out of his delirium by tonys call nobody else was informed tony knows that  which makes it even worse hearing christopher talk about pie omys death could therefore only lead tony to the conclusion that chris himself has set the fire given the impressively elaborate writing process as told by the writers themselves on the dvd i really wonder none of them realized the problem there the story just doesnt work that way unnecessary to add that im a huge fan of the sopranos otherwise i certainly wouldnt care
6,i have to say i quite enjoyed soldier russell was very good as this trained psychopath rediscovering his humanity very watchable and nowhere near as bad as id been led to believe yes it has problems but provides its share of entertainment
1,my rating refers to the first seasons of stargate sg1 which are wonderfully fresh creative and addicting when the cast stepped through the gate you never knew what lay on the other side starting around season the show took a different focus  still good but differentbr br the series follows the adventures of a team of humans and one alien who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the stargate the backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie stargate in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in egyptbr br the episodes are light innocent and easy to watch and very creative many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great scifi movies of their own what happens next was always unpredictablebr br the characters on which the show rests are also welldefined and brilliantly performed their tone is serious but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor they are simply fun to watchbr br starting somewhere around season the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe the goauld then the ori the plots become more complex a lot more politicalstrategic oriented and interdependent the characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in naturebr br one thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the 100th and 200th episodes they are simply cantmiss shows they exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through 10 seasonsbr br if you are a scifi fan watch a few episodes of the first seasons and youll likely be hooked if you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides you have 10 seasons of shows to look forward to
7,one night i stumbled upon this on the satellite station bravoinitially out of curiosity i decided to watch itto be perfectly honest i wasnt disappointedthe main character is beautiful and her body is shown off wellyou would think her talents would be wasted as a executioner but apparently not after watching the whole filmmy only real gripe is the acting of the supporting cast particularly the actor who plays melnikchrist its badthe prison guard hank is woeful tooall he ever does is get drunk and make ill attempted passes at his coguard wanda though fortunately for us the viewer and for hank he gets down and dirty with wanda near the end the music used is pretty tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the executions this movie is well watching alone for the beautifultalented and very sexy jennifer thomas
7,pathetic worse than a bad madefortv movie i cant believe that spacey and freeman were in this flick for some reason morgan freemans character is constantly talking about and saying pussy when referring to nsync boys girlfriend morgan freeman calling women pussy is just awkward what the hell were the people behind this film thinking too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting confusing camera angles a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearablebr br i rented this flop with low expectations but well it really sucked
0,garde  vue has to be seen a number of times in order to understand the subplots it contains if youre not used to french wordy films based upon conversation and battle of wits rather than on action dont even try to watch it youll only obtain boredom to death and reassured opinion that french movies are not for youbr br garde  vue is a wordy film essentially based upon dialogs written by audiard by the wayand it cruelly cuts the veil of appearancesbr br why does matre martineau serrault prefer to be unduly accused of being a child murderer rather than telling the truth  because at the time of the murder he was with a 18 years old girl with which he has a 8years sexual relation his wife knows it shes jealous of it and he prefers to be executed in 1980 in france there was still death penaltyrather than unveiling the sole pure and innocent aspect of his pitiful life

1,i have to say i totally loved the movie it had its funny moments some heartwarming parts just all around good me personally really liked the movie because its something that finally i can relate to my childhood this movie in my opinion is geared more towards the young gay population it shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up all the taunting namecalling and not knowing is something i like most other young feminine boys will always remember and now finally a movie that illustrates how hard it really is to grow up gay so i would definitely recommend seeing this movie probably shouldnt really watch it until a person is old and mature enough to understand it
0,this is the finest film ever made to deal with the subject of aids its a documentary about two men living with and dying of this illness the film is beautiful heartbreaking funny and incredibly moving above all it is an amazing true love story be sure to have a few hankies ready before you watch this movieyou will need them extraordinary
3,1st watched 8262001  out of 10dirtobe hooper scary yet sadisticwhich makes sense portrayal of a relative of the marquis de sade carrying out the same sadistic acts and enjoying it that supposedly his predecessor did this tobe hooper film really doesnt do a whole lot different than his similar in style freddy krueger movies with the same star freddy himself  robert englund playing a dual rolethe marquis de sade and his relative it is also seems like it wants to really poke at christianity but then loses that in the end much to my chagrin but leaving an inconsistent feel to the movie could have been much worse if excesses were taken in sex and violence but they try to keep this at a minimal despite some disgusting scenes my final thought is why would hooper want to make this movie it obviously took awhile to actually get distributed then it has to be advertised gruesomely and with hoopers name in the title to hopefully make some money on his name and his gore its obvious this didnt work
0,magnolia is a preposterous bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little like eyes wide shut magnolia is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence the camera swoops through hallways and corridors catching glimpses of sad characters where is the reason to care for these people the common theme seems to be people who yell a lot who cant care for others except for john c reillys and philip seymour hoffmans characters and are selfdestructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying i was reminded of how much i disliked shine because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by armin muellerstahl there are so many unattractive unappealing characters here why would we want to spend time with thembr br having said that there is nothing held back about magnolia paul thomas andersons ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon there are two ideas in particular that bomb both happen in the last hour of this 188minute film one has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of aimee manns coffeehouse folk songs sweet but ineffectual since we cant see what strings them all together the other idea i refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculousbr br magnolia has a lot of great acting particularly tom cruise who unleashes a performance i didnt know he had in him and john c reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory but it all adds up to nothing when the secret unexpected event happened a girl behind me in the theatre couldnt hold it in any more and said this is stupid my feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree
7,this movie is actually worse than most movies ive ever suffered through and ive suffered through a lot absolute nonsense its got terrible forced dialogue pointless plot developments really drawn out spooky imagery scenes which look more like a high school remedial art project than a horror movie 510 at best attractive women long boring sex scenes involving said women forget what you know about virgins especially ones with lop sided fake breasts muttered difficult to understand speech from some of the characters and they actually used the masks from killer klowns from outer space during a masturbation scene which should be a saving grace because that movie was pretty funny but it isnt veden fell is the lamest bad guy in the history of film br br absolutely give this one a miss
4,people forget that there have been several king kong ripoffs congo king kong vs godzilla king kong 1976 they all ripoff one another but yeti stands on its own it only borrows one element from king kong and that is the animals attraction with one femalebr br the yeti myth is based on bigfoot not like king kongand archeologists have been fascinated it at one time they did existbut there is no scientific data to prove itbr br this movie is hard to find but its worth watching it the first time i watched it was on elviras mistress of the dark shows in the early 1980s it sent chills down my spine as a kid especially when the yeti got mad i saw it again around 100am on abc about to 3yrs ago seeing it again made me appreciate it more it has some overall good effects for its time and the story involves a mute boy and his dog and an evil businessman person who wants to kill the yeti for his own purposes also the music is pretty coolits very yeti like br br gianfranco parolini and the yetians creates a great monster like atmospherebr br vote and half out of 10
6,this movie seemed to have it all going for it with good camera sound film sets music costumes  but drumroll gary stretch spoke i dont know if it was his poor acting or simply a bad script but would say it was both considering the casting of him in this role i found it difficult to root for him even to the very end i wished hed have died in battle or one of the swordknife scufflesbr br then the tinder for the plot to kill the king was because the king didnt have dinner and sex with his queen pretty lame and to go to the extreme to kill her own son and to then push up her lover as succeeding king i see a thread or two here and there of historical bytes but the manner in which this was all presented was farcicalbr br i dont recognize gary stretch from anything else but he was dreadful i read another users comments about audio being dubbed but dont think his was dubbed  after all he speaks english right it really was awful the lines were read right off the coroners table  flatline it could be he just doesnt have the voice to carry tone fluctuationsbr br aside from this i did watch it to the end so the movie had at least an interest it could have been more if the scriptlines and casting had been given more work the scenery and filming crew along with very good quality film is what really made this movie above all else the cast and story were all secondary i give the film crew a 10
0,the father of the whos alcoholic drummer keith moon was named arthur i found so many similarities between dudley moore and keith moon in this movie liza minelli who usually overacts did quite a good job in this one and was able to turn cheek on dudley moore in every turn yes i agree sir john stole absolutely every scene it was a very different movie enabling the viewer to have a glimpse into another life we often try to catch a rerun of this movie on satellite god rest dudley moore this was such an enjoyable movie much satire and thumbs down to the rich and snobbyaffluent the close friendship between moore and sir john is rather endearing
4,moon child was one of the more symbolic movies ive seen what i really liked about it was the illustration on immoralitymortalityand the obstacles and guidances through life the movie depicts a great deal of vampire kei having the power of immorality and the advantages to it whether if it is having supernatural abilities or everlasting life these are what humans usually wish for moon child shows the pain and disadvantages of being immortal since the feelings towards loss impacts almost all the characters especially to the main characters sho and kei the meaning of the title moon child reveals as the film comes close to the end where it clearly shows that everyone is a moon which shines other peoples way giving guidance i personality quite like that moral the movie depicted on the weaknesses of the film lies in some parts of the acting and special effects since it made the film less authentic the scene where character toshi dies could have been more powerful and realistic if more authentic emotions in the acting were put into it some scenes with special effects like the gun shots also could have been more authentic without making it seem too much like an action video game the sparks that came out of the guns appeared too fake and i think that could have been eliminated or fixed nevertheless i think moon child should be a movie everyone should consider watching the symbolic ideas and images the movie brings out would be easily accepted by everyone and may interest many viewers it is quite a thoughtful film and also entertaining to watch
1,im watching this on the star world network overseas which buys american and canadian series that last one or two seasons like the jane show i thought of how many female lead comedy shows im actually able to watch on my own theres lucy bewitched i dream of jeanie the one with barbara feldman and then my mind goes kind of blank i cannot think of any others the women are all supporting roles not the lead so for me the jane show is in pretty good company one thing i just thought of though ive watched several things made in canada and i never recall any thing being filmed in a regular tv series that shows snow its all made at the height of summer lol granted its a great place to live climate wise in the summer but you would think they would show a little bit of canada in the winter since thats part of the lifestyle there also i mean sctv just for laughs come to mind as two comedy shows that lasted a long time filmed in canada and very little or none is shot with snow present even though they both do a lot of outdoor shots i digress but i kind of chuckle at jane and her obviously liberal ways being accused of racism to her neighbor and i like the bald guy and his craziness i found it on par with a uk series called the it crowd i think another office comedy with a female lead not by any means the best comedy ever but for a guy to say he can watch it alone thats saying something if i was with my wife she might really enjoy it since it addresses sex in the office and stuff like that so might be a good light comedy for couples to watch of 10
1,this is the worst piece of crap i have seen recently there is nothing good about this movie the plot is plain stupid dialogs dont make any sense humorous scenes never heard anything about the real humor actors just dont play the worse they dont even try the script itself is somewhat which is in the same league with ed wood and uwe boll there is only one good thing in this flick the fights they are well choreographed as one would expect of the hong kong guys and are the only reason to watch prince of the sun although i believe the fights are just supposed to fill the empty space so that the screenwriter didnt have to bother thinking about the storyline however this weak and absurd plot may prevent you from watching it to the end avoid it unless you are fan of the dragon lady cynthia rothrock
0,my favorite quote from crow was when the car was going off the cliff the movie is so bad even the car wants to get out of itbr br this had to be the funniest movie i have ever seen it was seriously out there to scare you which makes it even funnier if it werent for mystery science theater i wouldnt be here today p
3,i have read the whole a wrinkle in time book and then saw the movie the movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was 190 pages and the film was hours it felt really crammed in with too many effects and bad actingbr br a wrinkle in time is about a girl named meg charles wallace and calvin must team together to find megs father and get off the island camazotz br br the beginning of the film is really a stinker the acting is awful the direction is laughable and so far the situations arent necessary i really was crushed to see the same person madeleine engle that wrote the book and created the movie made a great book and a terrible film the acting is worse than any straighttovideo acting yes i got to admit there was cool effects but seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible if you read the book you will be crushed by the movie i wish could give it a but sadly i can only give it a half could have been useful
7,as someone who lives near buffalo new york this movie scored points with me before i even saw it since the story is based here there are even some bit parts with reallife newstv anchor people from buffaloand for once it doesnt knock the area hallelujahbr br theologywise puhleeze god is still made to look and think like humansand of course be a bit on the liberal side being the lightweight comedy it is its nothing that should win any awards but it still is entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill 102 minutes br br there are some laughoutloud slapstick comedy scenes and hopefully audiences  from christians to atheists got something out of this besides a few laughs such as what prayer should really be all about kudos to the writers for at least getting that theology correct and giving a good messagebr br overall its a goodhearted film that should offend very few
7,this film has good characters with excellent performances from the cast david strathairn is diabolically sincere as the child molesting salesman and danny vinson plays a perfect pussywhipped southern husband the slick soundtrack betrays the murder ballad tone of the film

2,this film made for french tv deals with the tragic effect it has for a close knit family when leo the young man at the center of the story is diagnosed as having the aids virus announces it to his parents they just cant believe it the film is a character study on how this family deals with its subjectbr br the director christophe honore has to be congratulated for bringing this frank account to the screen nowhere but in france could this story make it to the movies because of the subject matterbr br the news has a devastating effect on marcel the young brother who hears about what leo has contracted in spite of the way the parents want to shelter him from realitybr br yaniss lespart and pierre mignard do a convincing job in portraying the brothers

7,this movie was probably the worst movie i have ever seen here are the things that immediately jump out at me the woods were more like hills in los angeles with a couple trees and brush not scary whatsoever news flash if you are filming in the southern california area big bear is only an hour away they actually have trees therebr br the writing was absolutely without a doubt the worst dialogue i have ever experienced every possible line in the movie was unoriginal clich or just plain stupid for instance the name of the camp is camp blood lame the name of the clown is the killer clown lame what is a clown doing in a forest anyway was that the only mask they could find the last but certainly the least was the acting absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled a virtual cornucopia of shitty lines and poor acting worst part by far was when then randomly flash back to this fat foreign girl getting naked for a a photograph its a really long scene and i guess she was supposed to be sexy but she was not also and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me was this tool who is supposed to be athletic for instance when he is bored in the movie he grabs a couple rocks and starts doing curls with them then later on he is supposed to be running for the clown and it is immediately clear with his very girl like run that he is quite far from athletic oh and to the girl who played kat good lord stop singing that song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myselfbr br if for some reason you do see this movie i would at least recommend watching the special features the group of jackasses who made this film talk about it as if it is this really original story in fact one of the girls actually says that she let some of her friends read the screenplay and none of them could predict the ending apparently she hangs out with special kids
1,gespenster 2005 forms together with yella 2007 and jerichow 2008 the gespenstertrilogy of director christian petzold doubtless one of the cremedelacreme german movie directors of our timebr br roughly gespenster tells the story of a french woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a years old child while the mother turned around her head for minute in berlin  and has never been seen ever since then the mother keeps traveling to berlin whenever there is a possibility and searches by aid of timedilated photography for girls of the age of approximately the present age of her age as we hear later in the movie the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter marie however this time when she meets nina everything comes quite differentbr br the movie does not bring solutions not even partsolutions and insofar it is rather disappointing we are not getting equipped either in order to decide if the mother is really insane or not if her actual daughter is still alive or not most disappointing is the end after what we have witnessed in the movie it is an imposition for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves nina alone the simple walking away symbolizing that nothing has changed can be a strong effect of dramaturgy fex in umberto d but in gespenster it is displacedbr br since critics have been suggesting freudian motives in this movie let me give my own attempt why is it that similar persons do not know one another especially not the persons that another similar person knows this is quite an insane question agreed from the standpoint of aristotelian logic according to which the notion of the individual holds the individual is such a person that does not share any of its defining characteristics with anyone else so the aristotelian answer to my question is they do not know one another because their similarity is by pure change everybody who is not insane believes that however what about the case if these similar persons share other similarities which can hardly be by change eg scarfs on their left under ankle or a heartshaped birthmark under their right shoulderblade this is the metaphysical context out of which this movie is made although i am not sure whether even the director has realized that despite our modern aristotelian world the superstition conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality and that individuality therefore is not something erratic but rather diffusional so that the borders between persons are open such and similar believes build a strong backbone of irrationalism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking  a source of gespenster of the most interesting kind
7,this silly movie is really fun for the younger audiences its heros are a couple of dud detectives whose sophomoric attitudes lead them down some very silly roads chasing the big murder case you will see these detectives go to every length to solve the crime no nudity but lots of sexual implication slapstick sillinesseverything adolescents go for low budget but very entertaining definite cult classic potential

2,this movie is entertaining enough due to an excellent performance by virginia madsen and the fact that lindsey haun is lovely however the reason the movie is so predictable is that weve seen it all before ive havent read the book a mothers gift but i hope for britney and lynne spears sake it is completely different than this movie unless you consider ending a movie with what is essentially a music video an original idea the entire movie brings to mind the word plagiarized
5,the movie starts off in a classroom setting where not surprisingly our main actress orked was seen in a chinese language class later in the film she was asked on why by mukhsin that she was sent to learn mandarin her answer was simple for a child she is coz shes already known the malay language wellbr br its a bit of a romance one may thought of it but once youve stopped yourself from reading too much critics and go for it youll notice the typical elements of malaysia the movie basically focuses on 10 year old orked who met 12 year old mukhsin in a game of which many would think of it as a boys game running out of players mukhsin who was new in that village was forced to allow orked into the game in which she eagerly showed the male side of her orked is no such ordinary girl as she depicts more of the male behavior as you will see in the movie defending mukhsin from much violent encounter with her schoolbullies throwing one of the bullys bag out from the school bus window throwing punches and kicks on mukhsins brother where after he teased mukhsin and so on and so forth both were awesome buddies and stick closer than that but with a slightest of misunderstanding in which most of us would all respond to in the same way parted the both of them until the day when mukhsin left townbr br now the movie depicts the first love between orked and mukhsin they started out as friends but slowly evolving into somewhat more of a closer relationship and then towards bgr you would notice the changes yasmin made in the movies for each of the main actor and the actress when they go through love the different character was portrayed with eagerness and mild humor the scenes were all in random but it depicted so much reality in it that youd be stuck on the screen for a long time you will love the movie for what it is and not because that you want to be patriotic to the local scenes coz it means much morebr br as the movie envelopes around the two love birds it also manages to find its lens towards orkeds parents her mother who was educated in england speaks very good english and in which her husband and the caretaker in the house with very much attempt tries to speak back their own kind of english which was humor all the way indeed let me just explain to you why humor can be such a prominent thing in this movie and that explanation or description that you may portray can be given in only one word and that is randomness often more than not we dont learn to laugh at ourselves and when we do we do it at the expense of others it is just like what the movie just follow law by jack neo would have mentioned  often when we are ourselves we dont see the person in us we are but when only when we are in another persons body then only would we learn to see who we really are and that is how humor applies as well more so than just dignitybr br the movie was filled with such randomness that the typical facts of our routine lives as we carried it out could be all the way filled with laughter if we want it to bebr br the other focus of this movie was on how orkeds neighbor a couple in which the husband is no longer loving to his wife and wanted to find another pak koboi as what hes nicked after was seen polishing his motorbike daily and would take it out for a ride with his newly found girlfriend the producer did not fail to show you perhaps why the husband wanted to find another wife the wife was a real hurler or kpc as we chinese would call it having interrupting on other peoples business and sending her own daughter to tease orked in words only adults would use after all what goes around comes around and thats probably why bad things kinda want to happen to her in every time being nice to people around you wont hurt at all unless you have an ego to protect but then again whats it worth the movie also centers around mukhsins brother hussein who would go out to town everyday until very late at night smoking drinking and also finding girls hes the total opposite of mukhsin but thats all perhaps because of family problems both the brothers were staying with their aunt and the parents were far away from them i will not reveal more of the story line as it would spoil much of the interest in wanting to find it out for yourself but the slightest of all elements in which the producer wanted to send a message across to the viewers is the life of us all she wanted us me at least to view life from our own perspective when we are not ourselves movies in a way take us out from our own body places us in the characters position and use our empty mind then to view on the happenings of it depending on the type and genre of the movie you will be mesmerized by how a good movie such as this would portray and imply a significant impact on you
0,director jonathan lynn has made some underrated comedies in the past like greedy and clue this isnt one of them more akin to a police academy film than its inspiration it stars steve martin in the old phil silvers role as an army sergeant forever pulling scams under the nose of his superiors but the idyllic life of bilko and his lazy platoon looks shaky when an old enemy visits the base determined to catch bilko in the act nothing much happens really its all quite dull its not very funny martin dan aykroyd and phil hartman squeeze a couple of laughs out through sheer effort but theyre all better than this and its quite painful watching them work with such thin material
7,david mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with house of games a character study fraught with psychological overtones in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game margaret ford lindsay crouse has a successful practice and has written a bestselling novel driven still she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life theres an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve and it primes her vulnerability when a patient billy hahn steven goldstein confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers and that theyre going to kill him if he doesnt pay she decides to intervene on his behalf this takes her to the house of games a seedy little dive where she meets mike joe mantegna a charismatic conman who wastes no time before enticing her into his world instead of the twentyfive large that billy claimed he owed mike shows her his book and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars and mike agrees to wipe the slate clean if shell agree to do him one simple favor which involves a card game he has going on in the back room in the middle of a big hand mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes while he is gone her job is to watch for the tell of one of the other players by this time not only margaret but the audience as well is hooked the dialogue and mamets unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines is mesmerizing as mike leads margaret through his compelling surreal realm of existence and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game we are swept right along with her from that first memorable encounter when he demonstrates what a tell is and how it works to the lessons of the short con to the stunning climax of this film mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless and nothing is what it seems in the end margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature and about herself she changes and whether or not its for the better is open to speculation mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows and does crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here you feel the rigid uptight turmoil roiling beneath that calm selfassured exterior and when her experiences with mike induce the change in her she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated she makes you believe that she is capable of what she does and makes you understand it as well the dynamic supporting cast includes mike nussbaum joey lilia skala dr littauer jt walsh the businessman ricky jay george and william h macy sergeant moran house of games is the quintessential mamet hes written and directed a number of highcaliber plays and films since and will no doubt grace us with more in the future but this film will be the one that defines him and you can go to the dictionary and look it up youll find it under perfection this is one great movie you do not want to miss i rate this one 1010
5,a first time director bromell has assembled a small but powerful cast to look at the world of a middle aged middle class depressed hitman and his struggle with his relationship with his father this film in less than 90 minutes presents an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature david dorfman as the year old son of william h macy is the most refreshing little actor ive seen in awhile macy is brilliant in a part that almost seems written for him as a self tortured sole struggling to break the reins of his father and his business its always great to see donald sutherland and here hes wonderful as the callous father of macy the films alternate audio track is well worth it to hear the director explain how he picked the cast locations and filmed the movie the basic dolby channel sound is adequate for this film and well recorded the cinematography creates the mood along with a very subtle musical background any film buff or observer of human nature will enjoy this one especially if hes a fan of contradiction
6,good grief while i still maintain that manos the hands of fate is the worst piece of mental torture available hobgoblins came awfully close thisthisthing insults the audience at every opportunitybr br at least films like space mutiny and future war can be enjoyed on mst3k this one was a struggle to get through i was literally writhing on the couch in anguish this thing managed to embarrass me  alonebr br even if you are a diehard mst3k fan and have made it your mission to see every single experiment think twice about seeing this onebr br its that bad
3,ive never been impressed by jd anyway and final justice which i hadnt seen prior to its mst3k airing proves to be no exception its not that the character is any less likeable than mitchell its just that theres less that geronimo call me heronimo to dislikebr br in fact one suspects that mitchell and final justice were all schemes of a revengeseeking agent of joe dons trying to get the star killed by inducing a heart attackbr br joe don must have found a new agent since hes now graduated to comic relief in james bond movies the problem is its hard to tell the difference between his comedy characters there and his serious characters in his actionmovies like this onebr br as for the plotumm what plot they repeat the same set pieces so repeatedly youll think you were watching groundhogs day presumably the fact they keep using the same scene of geronimo getting out of jail is supposed to be comic relief of some sort ummm yeah whateverbr br on the plus side the malta scenery is pretty gorgeous so that kicked it up to a for me one suspects this flick set maltese tourism back a couple of decades though
3,screenwriter lisa lutz began writing the screenplay at the age of 21 in 1991 br br is she even in business if someone gave her another chance after this piece of crap shes up for the most fortunate person of ever awardthis movie sucks to no endit never ceases to amaze me what the turn into moviesand the fact that they made this writer put it off for a bit seriously i can write better crap than this in my sleepbr br ok so how many lines to i have to type i dont get this at all i guess im a newbie i guess i dont understand why there should ever be a limit to what anyone has to sayor a quota seriously i dont care if you have a one word sentenceor even a one word response i mean cmon br br thanksis this enough finallybr br this movie is worthless
7,when i think women in prison my mind often goes to sleazy italianspanish productions by directors such as jess franco and bruno mattei and while these films are often very sleazy theyre also very samey and once youve seen one you might as well have seen them all i have to admit that these types of films generally arent my favourites but in fact the idea of women behind bars has been done very well on several occasions outside of italy and spain and roger cormans new world pictures is responsible for some of the best of them caged heat is the directorial debut of oscarwinning director jonathan demme and its a well done little flick with plenty of entertainment value naturally the film centres on the story of a girl who is caught committing crime and sent to a womens prison where she is introduced to a host of violent inmates this prison is ruled over by the stuff wheelchair bound superintendent mcqueen and she takes offence to a play put on by the girls leading them to plot an escapebr br this film is much lighter on the sleaze than im used to in a women in prison flick but this is more than compensated for by some great action scenes and dialogue and thats what ensures caged heat entertains throughout it does have to be said that the plot is not particularly original or ambitious and basically follows a structure similar to many other women in prison films that came before it but thats not such a big problem the film never gets boring and is peppered with standout scenes including an escape attempt while out working in a field and a bank robbery the film is helped along by assured direction from the man who would go on to helm the masterpiece the silence of the lambs and a great cast with plenty of standouts including best of all the legendary barbara steele in the role of the head prison warden overall caged heat may not leave the viewer with much to think about by the end but its a brilliantly entertaining little grindhouse flick and anyone that enjoys this type of film will surely want to track it down
2,although a film with bruce willis is always worth watching you better skip this one i watched this one on television so i didnt have to plunk down cash for it lucky mebr br the plot develops slowly very slowly although the first 30 minutes or so are quite believable it gets more and more unbelievable towards the end it is highly questionable if a seasoned soldier like lt waters would disobey direct orders and even if he would if the rest of his platoon would they know he puts them in direct danger and they know they will certainly die if they follow him but what the heck he is our lt so lets do what he says despite the direct orders rememberbr br still there are some nice scenes in this movie they somewhat save a village where the total population is being massacred by the rebels well they save a dozen villagers or so the rest was already killed the strange part of it that they did take the trucks which the rebels left behind they rather go on foot maybe because the roads are unsafe but there was no explanation for it anyway i think this was what earned the movie the one point i gave itbr br what made this movie an insult to the brain and hence completely unbelievable is that a group of soldiers can kill of so many rebels without being hurt or killed themselves only near the end they loose a few comrades and that is only because they have to fight of an army of nearly 500 or more can you believe thatbr br they fight of an army of so many kill hundreds of them and only loose a few of themselves and they have rounds and round of ammo never run out of it grenades and claymore mines an m60 machine gun and even an rpg where do they get this stuff carrying it around or what they even got a laptop which shows them the activity of enemy rebels and this laptop has a battery which goes on for days really who think up this crapbr br i guess if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots you give this movie a high rating if not skip this one it saves you time
6,gino costa massimo girotti is a young and handsome drifter who arrives in a road bar he meets the young beautiful and unsatisfied wife giovanna bragana clara calamai and her old and fat husband giuseppe bragana juan de landa owners of the bar he trades his mechanical skills by some food and lodging and has an affair with giovanna they both decide to kill giuseppe forging a car accident the relationship of them become affect by the feeling of guilty and the investigation of the police this masterpiece ends in a tragic way the noir and neorealistic movie of luchino visconti is outstanding this is the first time that i watch this version of the postman always rings twice i loved the 1946 version with lana turner and the 1981 version where jack nicholson and jessica lange have one of the hottest sex scene in the history of the cinema but this one is certainly the best my vote is ten
4,there are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lifetime but for some reason or another we remember those persons for the rest of our lives these once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we dont meet these people anymore we dont always even know their names as we are never presented to each other and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are its funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such because reuniting might spoil fond memories or we dont know do they we are too afraid to check that outbr br the movie before sunrise just caught me watching it i never had intention to watch it through but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting i gave a look for the rest of the film i didnt know what to expect from it but nor did the young couple they had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate i believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through it makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives
0,the movie opens with a flashback to doddsville county high school on april fools day a group of students play a prank on class nerd marty when they are punished for playing said prank they follow up with a bigger prank which par for the course in slasher films involving pranks on class nerds goes ridiculously awry leaving marty simultaneously burned by fire and disfigured by acid for the sake of being thorough fast forward five years where we find members of the student body gathering at the now abandoned high school for their five year class reunion we find out that it is no coincidence that everyone at the reunion belonged to the clique of pranksters from the flashback scene as all of the attendees are being stalked and killed by a mysterious jester maskclad murderer in increasingly complicated and mindnumbingly ludicrous fashions it doesnt take sherlock holmes to solve the mystery of the killers identity as it is revealed to be none other than a scarred marty who has seemingly been using his nerd rage and high intellect to bend the laws of physics and engineering in order to rig the school for his revenge scenario the film takes a turn for the bizarre as marty finishes exacting his revenge on his former tormentors only to be haunted by their ghosts marty is finally pushed fully over the edge and takes his own life finally the film explodes in a crescendo of disjointed weirdness as the whole revenge scenario is revealed to be a dream in the first place as marty wakes up in a hospital bed breaks free of his restraints stabs a nurse and finally disfigures his own facebr br the script is tired and suffers from a terminal case of horror movie logic the only originality comes from the mindnumbingly convoluted ways that the victims are dispatched the absurd itwasalladream ending feels tacked on its almost as if someone pointed out the disjointed nature of the film and the writer decided then and there that it was a dreambr br technically speaking the film is atrocious some scenes were filmed so dark that i had to pause the film and play with the color on my television the acting is subpar even for slasher films i cant help but think that casting was a part of the problem as all of the actors look at least five years older than the characters they portray which makes the flashback scene even more unintentionally laughable their lack of commitment to the movie is made obvious as half of them cant bother to keep their accents straight through the moviebr br all of this being said if you like bad horror movies you might like this one too it isnt the worst film of the genre but its far from the best
1,a few months ago i was involved in a debate with another imdb poster hey kmadden about this film the poster insisted that if i gave flushed away a chance i would like it based partially on that argument i agreed to watch the filmbr br flushed away has good intentions at least on aardmans part but lacks the strength to pull it all together its best asset is sewer ratboat captain rita played by kate winselt who imo should have been the movies main character instead of roddy hugh jackman ritas cool tough and interesting while roddy spends much of his screen time snivelingbr br one of the things that bothered me most about fa is the repetition of jokes that arent funny to begin with when roddy gets hit in the crouch the film makes sure he gets hit five more times immediately my names shocky says one of ritas brothers who then electrocutes roddy at least three times my tolerance for cheap gags that involve pain is at an all time lowbr br i wont waste time griping about katzenbergs kleptomaniac tendencies toward pixar one similar films a coincidence fives a rip off but i will say im disappointed in aardman they can do and have done so much better try harder next time guys
0,this is probably one of the worst french movies i have seen so far among more than 100 french movies i have ever seen terrible screenplay and very medioacreunprofessional acting causes the directing powerless with all that it doesnt matter how nice western french scene and fancy music can add to the storybr br one of the key weakness of this movie is that these two characters do not attract people as an audience i dont care what happens to them br br it amazed me how this movie won jury prize in cannes man i love almost all the awarded movies in cannes but not this one a major disappointment for me
0,the photography of this bidbudget production is surprisingly bad colors are muddy and brownish and the photography has very 80ish look to it direction and editing are often quite uninspired and tvmovie like too and at first the movie only seems to want to torture its viewers with lurid images of sex and violence hans zimmers score is also a typically simple and bland work of this overrated untalented composerbr br but if you are willing to watch the movie further you are rewarded with a very moving family story a sort of european version of edna ferbers family epos giant while at first you wonder why clara married this idiotic man even his character gets more depth and more background one can judge him by clara delivers the movies spiritual lesson a great and moving statement set against the terrible happenings in her country her daughter whose lover is a young antonio banderas at the beginning of his international career understands that lesson and ultimately tries to live by it the way the plot was constructed with the ending mirroring the beginning was great the actors all do a great job too i was wondering who is the actress playing blanca all the time but of course it was a really young winona ryderbr br all in all this movie really made me want to read the book
6,ive now written reviews for several of the moh episodes and this is among the worst an interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits roll if watching people things they never would in real life amuses you lets check out the basement then this is your show except its not amusing or entertaining  its just annoyingbr br the extent of the virus is never ever showed i can very much overlook the fact that it affects men only as the resulting situation is very very frightening but then things deteriorate as daughter lets obviously deranged dad into the home and ultimately dies at his hands the woman flees north and runs into a few tens situations then some sort of spirit or alien or something appears and saves her things that make you go huh or something then she is huddling for warmth the endbr br awful these directors are mailing this tripe in
7,a somewhat awkward spy mystery with a predictable plot about world war two dangers the mystery is whether or not jane graystone nancy coleman has amnesia the best acting is done by raymond massey as dr ingersoll a good doctor turned evil he is head of a spy ring attempting to get information from amnesiac jane coded information related to allied activities will she tell can she remember moroni olson as mr goodwin is convincing as an accomplice to massey the role played by john garfield as dr lewis is nothing short of disastrous he seems so badly miscast that the casting has to be ranked as one of the worst in film history it is unfortunate that so talented an actor is stuffed into a role which not befitting his talents the movie is worth one look despite being a half spy and half gangster film and despite containing a parade of stereotyped characters its easy to forget this one amnesia is not necessary
5,what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica albabr br unfortunately the powersthatbe over at fox decided that they needed to finetune the plotline within episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer not even to see jessica alba i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming  where the first season stated she biologically couldnt sleepbr br the moral of the story the one that hollywood never gets if it works dont screw with itbr br azjazz
0,amazing documentary saw it on original airdate and on dvd a few times in the last few years i was shocked that it wasnt even nominated for a best documentary oscar for 2002 the year it was released no other documentary even comes closebr br it was on tv recently for the 5th anniversary but i missed the added where are they now segment at the end except i did catch that tony now works for the hazmat unitbr br ive seen criticism on documentary filmmaking from a few on this list i cant see how this could have been done any different they had less than months to assemble this and get it on the air the dvd contains more material and backgroundbr br im also surprised that according to imdbcom the brother have had no projects in the four years since what have they been doing
6,this is your standard musical comedy from the 30s with a big plus that it features some well known 30s actors in small fun cameosbr br there is not much to the story and basically the movie is all about its fun and noworries overall kind of atmosphere with a typical hal roach comedy touch to it appereantly its a cinderella story but i most certainly didnt thought of it that way while watching the movie the story gets very muddled in into the storytelling that features many different characters and also many small cameo appearance when the main characters hit the hollywood studiosbr br of course the highlight of the movie is when laurel  hardy make their appearance and show some of their routines its like watching a movie and getting a laurel  hardy short with it for free also laurel  hardy regular walter long makes an appearance in the routine and james finlayson without a mustache this time as the director of the shortbr br its certainly true that all of the cameos and subplots distract from the main plot line and character but in this case that is no problem since its all way more fun and interesting to watch than the main plot line and the shallow typical main characterbr br the movie is most certainly not any worse than any of its other genre movies from the same time period though the rating on here would suggest otherwisebr br 710
0,the brain machine will at least put your own brain into overdrive trying to figure out what its all about four subjects of varying backgrounds and intelligence level have been selected for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of man and environment since the only common denominator among them is the fact that they each have no known family should have been a tip off  none of them will be missedbr br the whole affair is supervised by a mysterious creep known only as the general but it seems hes taking his direction from a senator who wishes to remain anonymous good call there on the senators part theres also a shadowy guard that the camera constantly zooms in on who later claims he doesnt take his direction from the general or the project too bad he wasnt more effective he was overpowered rather easily before the whole thing went kablooeybr br if nothing else the film is a veritable treasure trove of 1970s technology featuring repeated shots of dial phones room size computers and a teletype machine that wont quit perhaps that was the basis of the films alternate title  time warp nothing else would make any sense as for myself id like to consider a title suggested by the murdered dr krisners experiment titled group stress project it applies to the films actors and viewers alikebr br keep an eye out just above the generals head at poolside when he asks an agent for his weapon a boom mic is visible above his head for a number of secondsbr br you may want to catch this flick if youre a die hard gerald mcraney fan could he have ever been that young james best also appears in a somewhat uncharacteristic role as a cryptic reverend but dont call him father for something a little more up his alley try to get your hands on 1959s the killer shrews that one at least doesnt pretend to take itself so seriously
2,do not bother to waste your money on this movie do not even go into your car and think that you might see this movie if any others do not appeal to you if you must see a movie this weekend go see batman againbr br the script was horrible perfectly written from the random horror movie format given a place in confined spaces a madman with various weapons a curious man who manages to uncover all of the clues that honest police officers cannot put together and an innocent and overly curious yet beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would love to be able to call their girlfriend mix together add much poorly executed gore and what the hell lets put some freaks in there for a little spin to the plotbr br the acting was horrible and the characters unbelievable  borat was more believable than thisbr br spoilerand can someone please tell me how a butchers vest can make a bullet ricochet from the person after being shot without even making the person who was shot flinch im in the army we need that kind of stuff for ourselvesbr br out of 10 and i would place it in the decimals of that rounded up to give it the lowest possible score i can
5,id always wanted david duchovney to go into the movie business and finally he did and he made me proud this movie lived up to what i had hoped for duchovney played his character very well managing to remain consistent with something new instead of playing the agent molder we are used to therefore i give him extra credit for his role also because i could not see anyone else playing that particular character david was great but nothing compared to the psychotic timothy hutton a brilliant performance that you dont get tired of throughout the movie because he never fails to surprise you he has weaknesses and strengths making the story all the more believable i also very much enjoyed the narration it added to the story a good deal and had some very memorable quotes that i still use to all the time this movie also had a wounderfull score i recomend this for anyone who likes drama and doesnt mind blood
3,ive seen plenty of scifi channel original movies ever since i started watching them back in 2002 my first one was sabretooth  which actually is one of the more entertaining scifi channel features in my opinion their quality varies some of them are average but decent sabretooth dragon fighter never cry werewolf swamp devil some are laughably bad and then there are some that are truly terrible raptor planet lies in the latter br br raptor planet a loose sequel to the 2004 scifi channel original raptor island is a barely watchable mess of a film with truly horrid acting and lazy scriptwriting the effects that bring the dinosaurs to life a combination of puppetry and animatronics as well as cgi and stock footage from raptor planet are some of the worst looking effects ive seen in a low budget film the gore effects are even unconvincing br br the plot involves a bunch of commandos who for some reason i forget why travel to a planet of alien dinosaurs thats right folks the dinosaurs are aliens dinosaurs in outer space whats next sharks in space the rest of the plot is simple the human cast are picked off and eaten by now weve come to expect this in the numerous dinosaurs movies and novels that are released but this is the first killer dinosaur movie ive seen where i actually became bored with all the dinosaur attacksbr br there are a few chuckles in it though theres one scene that stands out in which a man is being munched by a carnotaur brought to life by stock footage from the original film that seconds later becomes a giant raptor also a bit of trivia this is the scene where steven baur is shooting at his own death scene from the first movie br br while raptor island wasnt a good film to begin with its a masterpiece compared to its sequelbr br believe me when i say this is quite possibly the worst movie syfy has ever aired its darn near unwatchable
3,and i am a nicole kidman fanatic i would pay to see and hear her read the moscow phone book which for all i know she may have been doing when she was speaking russian in this movie br br all four of the principals are excellent but the movie itself is a number of good images and better scenes held together by nothingbr br while one is always ready to suspend disbelief while watching a movie this one asks too much of the viewer br br it could have been very funny which it is in parts or quite frightening which it is in one scene but the director didnt seem to know which way to go

2,nacho libre 2006 br br directed by jared hess br br starring jack black ana de la reguera hctor jimnez  darius rose br br mpaa rating pg13 for some rough action and crude humor including dialog br br say what you will about it i know some people who despise it to no end but i have always thought that napoleon dynamite was a funny movienot the brightest brick on the wall but a funny movie nonetheless jack black is also a very funny manirritating at times yes and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him but funny there has rarely been a jack black comedy that i did not enjoy to some degree so i was very happy to hear that jared hess the writer and director of napoleon dynamite and jack black would be teaming up for a movie about a spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage my only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin unfortunately my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie this plot had it been done as a skit on some such show as saturday night live or possibly even mad tv would have worked flawlessly unfortunately the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this onejoke comedy falls flatbr br nacho was raised in a mexican monastery and became a devout man of the lord feeling shunned by the entire monastery nacho black now the monasterys cook decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler as the monasterys finances hit an alltime low nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monasterys orphanage this plot sounds so sweet and caring it seems like the perfect movie for jack black look what he did with school of rock after all well to my displeasure this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie it is again hollywoods way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humorof course for all i know maybe that is the general thought of teenagers as many seemed to enjoy this movie watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh but dont expect to get an award for putting it in your movie a sevenyearold could make up the same jokebr br the performances in nacho libre are actually good jack black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic worthless lines in ever put on paper comical unfortunately this movie just wasnt enough for him it didnt give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him i had never seen or heard of ana de la reguera before but now i can say that not only is she quite talented but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced my eyesight she just clicked in the role and it worked wonderfully well hctor jimnez who plays nachos bumbling partner esqueleto kept me laughing continuously he did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of jack blacks darius rose who plays an orphan named chancho didnt have many lines but what can i say i just enjoyed him he was adorable the rest of the cast did their job it is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a subpar moviebr br nacho libre just does not work its plot is stretched far too thin the heart of it all is soiled by moronic humor and sickening jokes that just dont work i very rarely laughed and if i did it was because of jack black or another member of the cast and that leads me to the bright side of nacho libre yes the cast this cast was justwell for lack of a better word they were on they all clicked had excellent chemistry together and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script after jared hesss napoleon dynamite kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie i was surprised to find myself so often bored with nacho libre something was lost here and i have yet to understand what it was all i know is that nacho libre is not a good movie and yet because of its cast it is completely worthless there is a small reason to watch if only to watch jack black work but if you are not a fan of jack black then avoid this movie like the plague i like black but i am done with this movie and with this reviewbr br final thought yikes this is jared hesss surprisingly disappointing followup to his hysterical napoleon dynamitebr br overall rating 410 c
5,since starting to read the book this movie is based on im having mixed feelings about the filmed result i learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before i read the book because i found that if i read the book first i was inevitably disappointed in the film this would undoubtedly have been true here whereas in the case of atonement which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book ive ever seen it would probably not have matteredbr br im trying to figure out what the cause is and i suspect that i have to point my finger squarely at michael cunningham much as i respect him for the hours which i have not read but which i saw and was awed by i cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted susan mintons book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of itbr br its not that i dislike the movie i actually love the movie which is why since i started reading the novel im feeling disturbed about the whole thing i feel disloyal to ms minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work reading it i can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it unlike what one reviewer of the movie said its not so much that some novels dont deserve to be a movie its more like some books just cant make the transition ms mintons novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character so internally that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm even though a lot of the book is memory of real events it is memory and so fragmented and ethereal as to be i feel not filmable i think that ms mintons work is a real work of literature but cannot make the transition to film which in no way detracts from its valuebr br i cannot yet report that evening the film does not represent evening the novel in any more than the most superficial way since im only halfway through but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point i guess im writing this because i feel that if youre going to adapt a novel adapt it but dont make it something else that its not im not sure if michael cunningham has done anything wholly original but from what i can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone elses work we would not have the hours if virginia woolf had not written mrs dalloway and we would not have evening in its distressed form if susan minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place but its too much to say that it would be better if ms minton had left well enough alone because evening the film is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its ownbr br thus my confusion mixed feelings sense of disloyalty and ultimate conclusion that in this case the novel cannot be the film and vice versa and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did so that we have both works as they are

1,the year 2000 had been a bad year for indian films due to lack of quality and imagination from film directors other than mohabbatein and kaho naa pyaar hai nothing stood out cccc had lot of contraversy due to the financing of the film and this with not really knowing what the film is about has generated good publicity and advanced ticket sales for the film around india and abroad the only information given was that it was a suspense thriller the film is now been released in 2001 and the film was surprisingly quite good the main plot is to do with surrogacy and is well handled salman and preiti give a good performance where salman doesnt actually take is shirt off at allmust be special effects rani plays salmans wife but it is slightly a less demanding role compared with preiti who plays prostitute who eventually becomes the surrogate mother the three main leads confirm after har di jo pyar karega they have a solid on screen and off screen chemistryapparently salman khan who is excellent plays a serious role in the film as a successful business man and is a pity is being exploited as a wannabe comedian in his other films as he is quite underrated in the mumbai film industry partly due to the films he chooses ranis character does not know preiti is a prostitute until the endthis kept from her and the rest of the familythe rest you should find out as it will ruin the film if i told you the songs are all picturised well especially dekhne walon and the main title song the other supporting actors do a minimal but fine effort as salmans loving family abbas mastan has produced a hit and handled the film subject tactfullyi say go and watch it or rent it whatever you prefer
0,you sit there for a half an hour and watch a story believing it all then watch another half an hour of the same story utterly unraveling and then put back together again brilliantbr br one of the most exciting feature films at the san francisco international film festival is a documentary i dont know if  other than andrew jareckis capturing the friedmans  there has ever been anything like anna broinowskis forbidden lie it features exposes defends reveals and questions everything about norma khouri author of honor lost the acclaimed and lambasted 2001 bestseller about honor killings in jordanbr br what is quite incredible and what makes the film so exceptional is that this exposure of khouri is made with khouris full participationbr br for the initial portion of the film khouri presents her story about the supposed honor killing of a friend of hers in amman the story of the book she sounds completely believable convincingbr br then her story is taken apart exposed by eminently believable and convincing people such as womens rights activists in jordan investigative reporters there and in australia where khouri lived for a whilebr br khouri comes back and denies the accusations taking a successful liedetector test in the process there comes another segment of devastating exposures  not to be specified here because that would lessen the shock value and then khouri comes back and faces the accusations not all but the essential ones in the matter of the bookbr br and the houdini act continues with round after round in this heavyweight seesaw prize fight surprise after surprise  and there is no happy ending in the sense of resolution brilliant
5,why cant more directors these days create horror movies like the shining theres an easy answer to that modern day directors are not stanley kubrick kubrick proved onceandforall with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and auteurs of all timebr br so the plot is fairly simple a man named jack torrance played brilliantly by jack nicholsonand his family move into a large secluded hotel to watch over it for the offseason the kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered his wife and two girls what follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie but you have to watch it to see what i meanbr br this is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as scary its some seriously messed up stuff but in a good way one of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music music has been a major part of kubricks movies 2001 a space oddysey and a clockwork orange just to name a couple and he definitely doesnt disappoint with this one the score completely sets the tone and this film would not be the same without itbr br finally i must comment on nicholsons legendary performance jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer in fact just his stare steals a few scenes of this movie this is topnotch acting that must be seen to believebr br there will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one rip stanley
5,as drunken millionaire playboy arthur bach dudley moore is perfect as a grown man trapped in childhood as it turned out the role fit moore so perfectly it trapped him as an actor as well many disappointments soon followed including this films pale sequel yet that doesnt diminish the charm or appeal of this picture which is cleverly written and directed some of moores drunk scenes are forced parts of the film are wobbly but the cast performs with so much relish its a difficult movie to resist it has a very big heart and gives oscarwinner john gielgud a sly dryly amusing role as arthurs valet hobson his relationship with arthur is delicious and they have a miraculous rapport liza minnelli as a bluecollar loveinterest is sassy in a lowkey and moore is brash but deft and lively he never shook off the shadow of arthur but at least we have this document of a career highpoint to cherish  from 
7,this is definitely one of the best kung fu movies ever and may be one of the best movies ever its got a great plot that functions like a puzzle with lots of intrigue and suspense this film is full of cat and mouse games and deceptions with people hiding their identities and their natures the characters in this film live and breath much more than your average kung fu movie characters they are all interesting and compelling and the movie does a good job at giving them scenes to show their personalitys and desiresbr br the fight scenes play out like little stories and many of them are very original and exciting it has cool training sequences and martial arts skills that are so awesome they enter the realm of fantasy there are members of the poison clan each one with his own style that mimics the special skill of a venomous animal the styles of each of these characters are fun to watch and you can see the techniques they use in training applied during the film when this happens the director uses quick cutting back to the training scene to draw a parallel these cuts are accompanied by music changes and sound effects and the whole thing really works nicelybr br one thing about this movie that is very original is the way it treats death the director chang cheh was obviously very concerned that the film not trivialize death this makes some of the scenes in the movie much more effective we actually care when people are killed in this film this is because the camera lingers on the horror of death even when the bad guys are killed some of the sequences in this movie are truly gut wrenching when characters go in search of vengeance you really feel their anger and painbr br at the same time this is also a fun movie it has all the typical things you expect from a traditional kung fu film there is bad dubbing the characters are willing to fight at the drop of a hat some of the sound effects are hilarious and at times the behavior of the characters is incredibly unrealistic all this just adds to the greatness of the filmbr br and lets not forget that this director was a visual stylist much more gifted than most of his contemporaries if you watch this movie closely you will notice that the technical prowess on display is virtuostic everything goes by so fast because of the quick cutting style and the rapid camera movements of the genre that it is easy to overlook how beautiful the movie really is the lighting and composition are spectacular at times the camera work and movement is extremely sophisticated along with very interesting fast paced editing in the scenes that portray suspense and intrigue for example imagine hitchcock moving at about twice the speed chang cheh was truly a master craftsman and artist who knew his genre and was able to produce important material while working within its confines he doesnt rattle the boat of the kung fu genre film but in a subtle way his skills permeate every scene and every shot and they add greatly to the quality of the work he is an important filmmaker who continues to influence many peoplebr br this is the real package a kung fu movie that delivers on every level its art its trash its emotionally moving and its fun it has a true sense of morality but doesnt allow that morality to get in the way of delivering good action i recommend it to everybody whether you are a fan of this genre or not
1,what i like about you is one of those series you need to see but arent sure you would see the beginning is cool and its sucks you into the series just for fun the second part i season 23 which are more stale they come and go in what you want what happens with many series is that they dont end with something special because the second part of the series always goes down into the drain this one also somewhat did the third part is the one to spoil and ruin the whole series usually but it doesnt this ending is perfect for the series it fits perfect actually i was pretty angry about all these guys in vals life actually i wanted to end with jeff in the end but later on it changed they chose to take vic into the series after almost seasons without him and that was the biggest surprise and also what made the series go on topbr br see it many times the series is actually very cool just dont expect the second part to be that good it isnt but the third part does what was needed and made the series to one that was worth the whole thing i am happy to say i was glad and happy about the series and now i will go over to see two guys a girl and a pizza place when i have seen the whole series i will be back
5,the haunted world of edward d wood jr is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as glen or glenda bride of the monster and of course plan from outer space this exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries such as look back in angora and the plan companion failed it rounds up his surviving entourage many of whom have passed away since filming and gives an honest examination of ed wood and his work nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear hollywood sentimental in its treatment of the director down to the haunting music this documentary is an absolute mustsee for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day the entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together eds life and untimely death for the viewer best watched at am while wearing an angora sweater
1,this was obviously the prototype for mick dundee but the adventures of barry mckenzie is funnier i was amused throughout and laughed out loud plenty of times terrific central performance by barry crocker in the title role an australian who invades england to upset the poms with his freeflowing uncouth ways few brits will be upset by barrys frequently cruel observations on his hosts the relationsip between the two countries is prickly but friendly and this is highlighted by the films final line delivered by a somewhat reluctant mckenzie as he boards the plane home i was just starting to like the poms
6,schizophreniac the whore mangler is another example of what happens when you get a bunch of untalented people together to make an extreme horror film any sort of acting production storyline fx etcgo out the window in an effort to create shockvalue now dont get me wrong  i consider myself a connoisseur of shock films and the sleaziergoriernastier the better  but its still nice to see some sort of talent from someone involved in the filmbr br schizophreniac chronicles the life of harry russo  a drugaddicted freakshow who takes orders to kill from his ventriloquists dummy rubberneck he goes on a few sprees killing hookers and other random people and screaming about how much he hates hoouhs thats whores for those of you that dont speak new yorkese and how he wants to rape them in the ass there are a few weak necrophilia scenes very little gore and some nudity to mix things up a bit  but nothing that you havent seen in a better filmbr br the only redeeming thing that i can find in this retarded film are the often unintentionally hilarious screamingfits from our main man harry he goes onandonandon about wanting to kill everyone and do them in the ass and it really becomes quite comical after a while in fact im almost tempted to believe that theres supposed to be some sort of homoerotic undertone to this film with all the ass talk and constant shots of harry running around with his dong hangin out in all honesty that joker is nekkid more in this film then the few chicks that show some tanda and some fullfrontal for good measure schizophreniac is mildly amusing as a 1time watch but i can really only recommend this to those that want to be able to say that they watched a film called schizophreniac the whore mangler to be honest  the title by far  is the best thing about this trasha generous 3510
1,i watched the whole movie waiting and waiting for something to actually happen maybe its my fault for expecting evil and horror instead of psychology is it a weird retelling of the oedipal myth i want to kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and compose musical theater with him i didnt understand why certain plot elements were even present why was the construction upstairs why was there that big stairwell with a perfect spot for someone to fall to their doom if no one was actually going to do so why have the scenes at all with the father at work why have such a nice kitchen if youre only going to eat takeout why would the boy want to be baptized and the parents be the ones to resist instead of the other way around i see lots of good reviews for this moviehas my taste been corrupted by going up with 70s bmovies and old sci fi flicks
7,i never trust the opinions of anyone regarding a film that goes for critics as well sure if it gets positive reviews thats ok and a plus but most films that get critical rave i hate i enjoyed this film for what it was an entertaining film it takes you out of your life for a couple hours and into a fictional characterthat being catherine trammell sharon stone is awesome in this role just like she was in the first one anyone who says she is horrible in this film must have felt the same in the first one bc she is back acting the same way she did in basic instinct catherine is hers and she plays her to perfection her one liners are great much like in the first one who can forget in the first film when she tells the cops if youre gonna arrest me do itotherwise get the fk out of here great scene and believe me she does it again in this one i was captivated by her her outfits the way she smoked her cigarettes believe me its worth the price just to see stones performance i cannot wait for this film to be released on dvd uncut because i can only imagine how much better it is going to be and yes there are lots of twists as in the first one including the ending
0,dont spend your money or your time on this pitiful piece of film in the guise of cinematographywhen every third word is devoted to foul language and there is no real plot as well as having a cast of old actors who are still giving the same dated performances from the past and have not evolved in their careers leaves a lot to be said i was expecting something better from award winning actor benicio del toro the vision that others may have of puertorricans will be irreversibly distorted by such trash as maldeamores a foul word at a given moment in a film may be used to emphasize a given point of view and may even be funny or sad depending on its context see the movie elsa and fred for example but it should not permeate the plot the movie is a total embarrassment and there was absolutely nothing funny or even cute about this film
2,this film was so disappointing from the blurb that made me decide to see phantom love why is it called thisi had expected something arty and thoughtful with beautiful imagery it did have some interesting images but these often seemed random and made no sense in fact they seemed like they were inserted to fill in time in the end the effect was listlessbr br i believe the film was meant to be atmospheric but it just wasnt the lack of a coherent plot did not help matters you might say it was mysterious but i think it was just incoherent with no atmospherebr br the main character seemed to be disturbed but the plot did not draw me in enough to care about her situation without looking at the cast list i would not have known that you see the main character as a child the film has very little context for the time place or character i am not a prude but the sex scenes there were several seemed pointless and confused me further i recognised lulu but i was not sure if it was the same man different men a lover her husband or was she a prostitute it was only when i saw the credits that i discovered the hairy back was meant to belong to her lover this film did manage to make what should have been shocking dream sequences involving lulus mother seem a bit boringbr br the nail filing actually made more sense as it did give some indication of lulus emotional state i will not fault the actors as i dont they had a lot to work onbr br i do not know if the lack of context or flow in the film was because of ineptitude or because it was pretentious but the end result was dullbr br i cant be bothered talking about it anymore

0,having not seen the previous two in the trilogy of bourne movies i was a little reluctant to watch the bourne ultimatumbr br however it was a very thrilling experience and i didnt have the problem of not understanding what was happening due to not seeing the first two films each part of the story was easy to understand and i fell in love with the bourne ultimatum before it had reached the interval i dont think i have ever watched such an exquisitely made and gripping film especially an action film since i usually shy away from action and thriller type movies this was such great news to me ultimatum is one of the most enthralling films it grabs your attention from the first second till the last minute before the credits rollbr br matt damon was simply fantastic as his role as jason bourne ive heard a lot about his great performances in the bourne 12 and now this fabulous actor has one more to add to his list i look forward to seeing more of his movies in the futurebr br the stunts were handled with style  each one was done brilliantly and i was just shocked by the impressiveness of this movie well done
7,while watching this piece of crap the day after i saw a 1min trailer  that one minute included all all what was at least not boring to watchbr br so dont waste money or time on this one get the original its much better though the effects might not be up to date
0,match point and now scoop have both convinced me that not only is woody allen doing a neat job making movies in england and that scarlett johansson is the right cast member but corroborated what i have known for years he shouldnt focus on neurotic rich new yorkers in this case johansson plays journalism student sondra pransky whom magician sid waterman allen puts in his disappearing box where she meets the ghost of murdered reporter joe strombel ian mcshane who tells her that the serial killings that have plagued london were committed by millionaire peter lyman hugh jackman so she gets to know him andwell i dont know how much i can tell you without giving it away but i can say that this is probably allens funniest movie in years theres his ubiquitous unique style of humor especially the line about his religionbr br so youre sure to like this movie if nothing else itll make you fall in love with london but mostly its just so damn hilarious even if you dont like woody allen you gotta love this one

6,this movie is so so so horrible that it makes angels lose their wings shaq had tried to make other crossover efforts like his work in shaqfu for the nes and his plethora of unbearable rap albums and later the epic serving of horrible filmmaking that is steelbr br theres not a single good thing to be said about this movie i saw it a bunch of times when i was very young but i mustve been an idiot then because this movie takes all that is enjoyable about films and tears it apart its fun to mock i saw it on the disney channel a while back and spent a few minutes doing that although once the thrill of mocking it is done you still become overwhelmed by its terriblenessbr br if you see it on tv try this consider as your watching the film removing from it all the scenes in which shaq uses his magical genie powers if you do that it becomes like a film about a pedophile chasing a kid and rapping to seduce him thats kinda funny and disturbingbr br a horrible example of film do not unless looking to mock it see this movie
0,the only reason i remember this movie is because it was and still is the biggest waste of time and money ever spent i was 17 and my friend was 18 we were the age when action movies were our thing to enjoy most ok 2nd most we walked out feeling so insulted we wanted our money back but the time could never be regainedbr br the editing is what killed this movie as the truck gets attacked by more and more vehicles with rocket launchers attached the movie completely insults the intelligence of the audience by having these rogue bad guys in 4x4 vw bugs shooting rockets at the truck please rockets at a truck known to be carrying plutonium whats worse is the these vws manage to get 1518 shots off of a rocket launcher you would see on vw with rockets fire of them cut around the truck with the last one attached come back a second later with two rockets attached fire another then go in front of the truck and now its back to a full set of rocketsbr br we toughed it out hoping for a big finish that never happened it looks like they just ran out of money and stoppedbr br just ridiculous
4,most successful comic book movies usually depend on having villains that are bigger than life ready to jump off the screen and strangle you alive with a smile or a demented line or two of dialog the tim burton batmans had it as did in an even more grotesque manner sin city with dick tracy producerdirectorstar warren beatty piles on the villains until it becomes part of the framework like a boisterous homage to 1930s gangster pictures only this time meant for kids as opposed to the darker bonnie and clyde dick tracy is filled joyfully with archetypes and bright primary colors where the criminals carry tommy guns and are formed on their faces to shape their personalities villains like the stooge shoulders lips the brow mumbles the blank pruneface spud chester gould gave the names to his characters that fit their profiles and gave his hero a jaw that could cut glass the film is a continuation of sight gags that are perfectly taken seriouslybr br if at the time movies like batman and underrated teenage mutant ninja turtles were darker depictions of reality within a comicbook outline dick tracy is more oldschool its a story of cops and crooks or rather a cop detective tracy as he tries to bust big boy al pacino in what is arguably his biggest performance to date and in a sense the one that makes sense for his grandiose style but with no such luck theres also a little kid called simply the kid charlie korsmo who somehow brings more spunk to this little kid than wouldve been imagined and tracys love interest in tess and then theres the nightclub dame madonna who probably doesnt give any kind of great acting performance but maybe that suits the role fine and she sings excellently when called upon who wont testify unless tracy admits feelings he doesnt have for her then theres convoluted dealings with taking tracy down and a mysterious masked figure with a scraggly voicebr br meantime as if doing an impersonation of a howard hawks film in a splash of visual effects and bigger explosions dick tracy adds on the winkandnod comedy and the action like its syrup on a tall stack of pancakes its a wonder to look at this world which is created in ways that have a fascination to them that had they been done today would just be simply by proxy of computers ie sin city which can be justifiably compared to beattys film were driven through this world in great big shots and then thrust in the plot line or whatever there is of it in big editing montages with camera angles that seem to come out of those little tilted panels in the comics of old im almost reminded of the cotton club during these sequences as story music detail and a few big punches and gunshots go a long way to revealing what needs to be said which actually isnt more than it needs to and theres a heapload of catchy dialog from the script one of my favorites the enemy of my enemy is my enemy plus any of pacinos references to other figures in quotesbr br revisiting this after seeing it for the first time in the movie theater and only remembering little bits dick tracy is a hardboiled fantasy to the finest degree its filled with good cheer for the kids and with some pretty good action squared away without some of the more sinister intent of its cousin comicbook movies ie pg13 fare and for the adults its throwback central done with panache and a solid feeling for the unsubtle even dustin hoffman hams it up and he barely says an audible word

4,i just rented and watched this movie just to see whats all the fuss about so heres what my reactions to it are its easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors the main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists this concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film however the movie doesnt shock or disturb me at all it just bored me this movie could be easily shortened to under 45 minutes all lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time like those scenery scenes and some scenes i described belowbr br contains spoiler i find the rape scenes quite tame i dont know if i have watched the cut or uncut version if there is actually such a version i also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot heres a list on top of my mindbr br why dont the rapists rape jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are that would be an excellent timebr br why dont they just gang rape her instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening jennifers ordeal by such a long time it would probably be more shocking and disturbing that waybr br i found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and head back to her house maybe to show that these rapists are really imbecilesbr br these rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right they shouldnt send a coward imbecile to do the jobbr br why didnt jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left which should be the first thing that pops up in most peoples mind especially for someone who is a writer br br why didnt these rapists smell danger miles away when they saw jennifer is alivebr br i find it really amazing that a slender lady like camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him ends spoilerbr br but hey this movie is not without its merits camille keaton is gorgeous and i get to hear one of the funniest line i have recently heard when matthew protest of going back into the house and kills jennifer why me why me i didnt even cm
6,why cant this type of compact entertaining mystery be filmed in the new century it keeps the viewer thinking and guessing all the way the cast is a great ensemble william powell exhibits true star quality who knowsperhaps he was rehearsing for his future as nick charles he is a joy to watch one also can see why eugene pallette made more than 200 films he is a great supporting character actor and his excellent chemistry with powell is fun to watch mary astor does above average work in a not very meaty role all other hands chip in to make this a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend 73 minutes i suspect michael curtiz had a ball directing his one bravo
2,the danish movie slim slam slum surprised me to be the worst movie i have seen to this date i didnt think that it was possible to top my list of bad bad bmovies but this one deserves the gold its not funny its bad acting its bad filmed and the storyline is bad the only positive thing i can say about this movie is it has three girls in it i truly believe this flick has the potential to knock of the other danish movie stjerner uden hjerner as the badest danish film ever made and thats truly something congratulations in advance
1,if dick tracy was in black and white the pope wouldnt be religious giving a new sense to the concept of color in a movie we are offered an unique experience throughout a comicstrip world and its one of the few movies which succeeded in doing so thanks to a serious script good direction great performances al pacino is astonishing and most importantly a powerful mix of cinematography art direction and costume design using only primary colors the experience is quite different from anything we have seen before and there is also a quite successful hommage to all the gangstermovie genre pratically extinct from modern cinema overall i see this movie as a fresh attempt and a touch of originality to a cinema which relies more and more on the old and alreadyseen formulas out of 10
0,i also saw this amazingly bad piece of anime at the london scifi festival if you have to watch this thing do so with a large audience preferably after a few beers you may then glean some enjoyment from it br br i found the dialogue hilarious lodged in my mind is the introduction of cremator the animation is awful it is badly designed and badly executed it may have been a good idea for the producers to have hired at least one person who was not colour blindbr br theres nothing else to say really this film is a failure on every level
5,i entered the theater to sky captain in 2004 expecting a good film nearly every review of this movie had been positive the effects looked enticing the previews convincingbr br needless to say disappointment actually doesnt describe the feeling i got from this film it was ragebr br beyond being boring and poorly written the reason this film gets a out of 10 stars is because everything in the film was stolen from another source i understand the difference between an homage and stealing this was stealing more importantly it seems that the filmmakers didnt steal to progress a point or move the plot along they stole just to show that they could there is literally no point to showing a clip of the wizard of oz in a theater at the beginning of the movie except to set up another scene that i wont elaborate on which steals from the same film needless to say every concept in the film was neither original nor even a spin on an old concept it was literally just a rehash of something i had already seen from pulpera robots reminiscent of the old superman cartoons and the recent film the iron giant to the silent martial artist minion of the villain that has been used in countless films most recognizable in recent years as darth maul in star wars the phantom menacebr br on the subject of the actual film most of the performances were completely wooden perhaps this is because the entire movie was done on a bluescreen with computer imagery filling in everything save the actors frankly this is no excuse for poor acting if a person was ever a child they understand that a lack of visual reference is no excuse for not tryingbr br finally there is no humanity in this film the protagonists are the only real human beings here nearly all the antagonists are robots and the number of friendly characters that are shown during the film can be counted on one hand if robots are attacking the entire planet shouldnt we expect to see masses of humanity running from them the subpar performance of the main characters prevents us from connecting to really anything herebr br the film wasnt the worst movie out there which is why i didnt give it a rather the film was an example of all that is wrong with modern action films the filmmakers tried to justify the movie with special effects but without artistic vision or originality of any kind it falls flat
5,thank god abc picked this up instead of fox the best description for those in the know is really wonderfalls meets dead like me in the best way possiblebr br im not sure whether an experience with death and destiny early in life makes me a fan of brian fuller but i certainly enjoy his productions i also enjoy checkered floors pies talking toys gravelings and other mischievous items  while a bit burtonesque i certainly think this enjoys its own niche that doesnt require j depp or hb carter to be a wonderfully imaginative playground here we can find the joys and sorrows of childhood and adulthood crashing into each and actually making sense and making us want to live life to the fullest
1,when a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible the cause can invariably be found in the book either it was pointless to start with or the point is one not easily conveyed to film or the movie missed the point which is the most frequent of these results and the easiest to happen especially when the point is one not easily defined the book morvern callar has a point every reader of the book must have felt this and felt as if he had gotten it but i suspect most of them could not state it in words im not sure i can myself but perhaps it comes to this or something like it things come things go such is life but we carry on or at any rate some of uspeople like morverndo no doubt a more erudite critic could construct a more adequate definition but the important fact is that there is a pointpossibly the sum of the entire story is the pointand that this would have been the main thing to keep in view and to carry over in adapting the story to film the maker of this film evidently missed the point and doesnt substitute one of her own and so the film is about nothingbr br this is not the usual complaint of a booklover that his favorite text has been violated the merit of the book is something i conceded grudgingly in reading it i found it a bloody nuisance and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly the narrative is supposed to be the work of the halfeducated morvern but that illusion is constantly dispelled by a dozen different types of literary effect as if the author were poking at her with his pen there are inconsistencies of style and tone as if different sections had been composed at different times and any conclusions i could reach about morvern had to remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended and which he did not for instance despite morverns own selfcharacterization as a raver am i wrong that in the end she remains essentially a workingclass scots girl and beneath her wrapping of music downloads not so different from those of generations past in any case despite my irritation at the author i couldnt deny that his book stuck with me and what i couldnt get out of my head was his characters attitude her angle on the world which was almost as vivid as a goya portrait morvern is the kind of person whos always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her like flies so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful sloggingthrough unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophicaland that doesnt begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough the complex of incidents and of morverns responses to them are the substance of the book and its achievement in exposing a crosssection of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise for all my dislike of the book i can see thisbr br the morvern just described is not the morvern of the movie or if it is most of her is kept offscreen an actress who might have been a good fit for the character had she been the right age at the right time is angharad rees from the old tv series poldark samantha morton then would seem like good casting shes rather the same sort of actress and in one of her earlier movies jesus son she played a girl who with a few adjustments could have been turned into this one unfortunately as the film turned out she doesnt have the character from the book to play for one thing the book is one that if it is to be dramatized virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience without her comments her perspective her voice the story loses most of its meaning it has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty and so morverns responses whether of amusement or distaste depending on her mood are missing too and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story in short the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk edgy seriocomic novel into a genteel art tv film and chose as her typical image one of ms morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy as if the outing morvern signs up for were a tour of the stations of the cross this isnt at all what the book or the morvern of the book was about for another thing the morvern of the movie isnt scottish the actress said in an interview she hadnt had time to study up the accent and she ought to be its important that she her family and her mates are all from a single place and finally the film is missing the end of the story morverns spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness its winter the dam has frozen the power has gone out and the pub is dark minus this and minus all of the rest whats left is a failed art film a dead film about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her refusal or native inability ever to give in to being dead
7,having been pleasantly surprised by sandra bullocks performance in miss congeniality i decided to give murder by numbers a shot while decent in plucky selfeffacing roles ms bullocks performance in serious roles see hope floats speed 28 days leave much to be desired her character is at the same time omniscient confused and sexually maladjusted the subplot of sandras past comes across as needless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character the two teenage boys gave decent performances although their forensics expertise and catchmeifcan attitude is belied by stupid errors that scream we did it chris penn as the alltooobvious suspect is wasted here as is ben chaplins token partnerlove interest characterbr br spoilers ahead mediocre acting aside the biggest flaws can be traced to a tvoftheweek plot that never has you totally buying into the murder motives in the first place and as mentioned the stupid errors vomiting up a rare food on the murder scene an all too convenient and framing of the school janitor the two boys hanging out together in public a convenient love interest to cause friction etc etc cause the view to go from being intrigues to being bored and disappointed by the murderers the ending was strictly by the numbers and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie using the nowcliched tactic of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment the final scenes surprise no one and lacked any of the socalled intelligence the film purported to arrive at its conclusion a somewhat promising concept but poorly executed and weak in nearly every way  out of 
5,you know this movie isnt that great but i mean cmon its about angels helping a baseball team i find the plot line to be hilarious anyways this kids dad says hell take him back if the angels win the pennant because he knows they wont kid prays to his fake god to help the angels win god helps the whole time via the angel christopher lloyd rip and in the end his dad doesnt take him back and rides off on his motorcycle right in that kids face its hilarious until danny glover adopts it and its friendbr br i guess the upside is that the old lady is left alone to die with her stitchin projects and her stories the real winner here though is god because later he got a job as a writer for numerous prank showsbr br as a kids movie it gets a as a movie about the mysteries of blind stupid faith and the nature of god it gets a 10
5,usually any film with sylvester stallone is usually going to suck ass rambo first blood part ii was no exception to this the only movies that sylvester stallone were in that were good were rocky and first blood this film is extreamly unrealistic and boring it has action but not very good action i didnt enjoy watching it and i would never ever watch this again no wonder why it won the razzie award for worst picture i would give this a 310 the only reason why it got the was because it had somewhat good action but not good enough
1,i never actually thought that a film could be so atrocious but alas i was wrong terrible acting terrible plot terrible effects the crocodile was awful and as for the stupid sexkilling scene all in one that was a bad move from the word go it was truly shocking and that is not a compliment how can someone make this film watch it back and then actually say yeah thats a good movie people will watch that if you havent seen it i beg you dont bother 
1,some things need to be clarified the picture of mark ferris is not the mark ferris who starred in this movie i know that because he was my dad please remove that picture also mark ferris was the writer at least one of them i have been trying to find a copy or a way to see this movie again it has been years and if someone can point me in the direction of obtaining a copy that would be great the movie wasnt all that bad and trying to compare it to todays world of star wars and other high tech sci fis it futile if you watch it just enjoy it for the rediculousness and humor it possesses lighten up on being movie snobs and enjoy some less creative and innovated films
3,this is quite possibly the most retarded 80s slasher ever realized but how can you be harsh on a film that features nonstop images of dozens of gorgeous ladies with exhilarating bodies doing aerobic exercises taking showers and wandering about in tight gym outfits prior to being a horror film aerobicide is a 90 minutes promo video to encourage the use of steroids silicons and other bodystimulating fitness products if youd leave out all the footage of hunky boys lifting weights and yummy girls wiggling their butts and racks to insufferable 80s tunes there probably only have about 15 minutes of story left plenty of time to improvise a plot about a sadist killer slaughtering young healthfreaks with a big safety pin yeah the film opens with an unintentionally hilarious scene of a girl getting fried between an electric sunbathing device several years later people turn up dead in the same spa you dont really need to be an experienced horror fanatic or a rocket scientist to figure out theres a link between the murders and the burning incident now do you investigating the case are a seemingly braindead police officer and charles napier lookalike and a beefcake private detective who gets lucky with the bustiest 80s beauty ive ever seen looking through the credits her names dianne copeland apparently and she didnt do anything else apart from this turkey and an imbecile tromamovie called surf nazis must die what a wasted opportunity she may not have been a great actress but she sure had two other big advantages that would help her move upwards in show business the amount of gore and the quality of the makeup effects are nothing special neither were treated to a couple of bizarre stabbings with a pin and some barbecued human flesh the plot twists near the end are ridiculous and predictable but by that time nobody is taking the film seriously anymore anyway aerobicide aka killer workout is recommended in case you want to switch of all your brain functions off for one night but nevertheless feel like watching a film it actually would make a terrific doublefeature with death spa both films have a lot of sexy and scarcely dressed babes  and both films are pretty dumb
1,although the flock has some pretty good acting by veteran richard gere and some okay shots that might harken some back to the silence of the lambs days the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowherebr br the film is about erroll babbage gere who works for the department of safety and is preparing to retire his office thrusts upon him his replacement allison lowry claire danes stardust who quickly discovers that babbage is obsessed with his job and that job aint very fun he monitors hundreds of sexual offenders who are on parole in his jurisdiction allison goes with erroll on many calls to check up on his flock of offenders and learns that he is in desperate need of retirement but erroll is good at his job even if his methods arent he taunts sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them erroll justifies his actions by bringing up these deviants pasts it is this good justification that challenges the audience on some level letting us see how brutal erroll is and yet how outoftouch hes become by being too close to his jobbr br when a teenage girl goes missing in errolls area he immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was abducted by one of his flock but how could he know is erroll that good at his job allison challenges him and erroll pushes back their battles become as fierce as errolls need to find this missing girlbr br although the setup for the story was okay it didnt have any umpf i will give credit to richard gere however who plays the erroll character very well battling retirement worried about everyone whos near his flock disgusted with those hes responsible for overseeing disgusted with himself for having to do some of things he does quite a change in character portrayal for gere but beyond him theres not much else some of the sets are okay dark and dangerous but there are so many other problems as to be laughablebr br ill be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement whenever watching films but that suspension has limits the biggest push against those limits is the destruction of extremely vital crime scenes someone as meticulous as erroll would know that moving a body would be a huge nono or trampling through a crime scene or moving evidence it went beyond and hurt the film to no endbr br the other damaging part of this film is that we never get into clair danes character allison shes almost dropped by the wayside at the end of the film and were never privy to what her intension might be will she stay or leave will she end up like erroll if she does stay this isnt a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground but the story as a whole needed to be tightened up
0,br br its a generic comingofage story  think the member of the wedding summer of 42 a summer place even little women  and there are moments where mulligan might have omitted the soupy music not used slowmotion or played down the goldenlit prettiness of the setting otherwise its done with rare emotional perfectpitch nothings forced every line has feeling and the pacing is just right even the belowalist casting helps bigger movie stars with more recognizable personalities might have overwhelmed the material in particular witherspoon is excellent her line readings are fresh and original and her body language is just right for a gawky hoydenish 14yearold on the eve of womanhood waterston is also very fine even if he has to spend much of the movie climbing in and out of the family truckbr br one senses that the films makers were aware of its unpromising commercial prospects  no big stars no big car crashes no special effects  and consciously decided to make the best possible movie box office be damned its intimate and honest and it sticks to the ribs if you find yourself misting up at the end you dont have to feel youve been duped
3,an opium den a dirty little boy actually a midget prostitutes galore a violent fracas in a dive a motel for sexual shenanigans scantily clad babes with cleavage a lot a boozer falling down the stairs a racially mixed clientle in a bar with asians africans and anglos treated equally does this sound like a film playing at the local shopping mall wrong these are all scenes from a 1933 musicalbr br the first half of footlight parade is preparation for a musical extravaganza which occupies the last half of the film chester kent cagney is about to lose his job and does lose his playgirl wife as a result of talking pictures squeezing out live stage musicals his producers take him to see a popular talky of the day john wayne in the big trail before each showing of the flick a dance number is presented as a prologue shorts news reels serials and cartoons would later serve the purpose kent gets the idea that a prologue chain would be the road to salvation for the dwindling live musical business kent is basically an idea man along the lines of choreographer busby berkeley could it be that cagneys character is patterned after berkeley could be br br in preparation for the prologues kent learns that his ideas are being stolen by a rival he uncovers the traitor fires him then unbeknown to him a new leak is planted in the form a dazzling temptress his assistant nan prescott joan blondell  soon to be mrs dick powell has the hots for kent and is determined to expose the wiles of the temptress a new singer from arkansas college shows up in the form of scotty blain dick powell who turns out to be a real find and is paired with bea thorn ruby keeler the resulting three prologue musicals which couldnt possibly have been presented on any cinema stage of the day are as fresh and enjoyable today as they were over seventy years ago honeymoon hotel by a waterfall and shanghai lilbr br of special note is the song and dance of toughguy james cagney like fred astaire and bill bojangles robinson cagneys dancing appeared natural and unrehearsed although hours went into practice to get each step just right not as good a singer as astaire cagneys singing like astaires sounded natural unlike the crooning so popular at the time its amazing that one person could be so talented and so versatile as james cagneybr br most critics prefer the shanghai lil segment over the other two yet the kaleidoscopic choreography of by a waterfall is astonishing how berkeley was able to film the underwater ballets and to create the human snake chain must have been difficult because it has never been repeated the close up shots mixed brilliantly with distant angles is a mustsee the crisp black and white photography is much more artistic than it would have been if shot in color br br though not nearly as socially conscious as gold diggers of 1933 footlight parade stands on its own as one of the most amazing and outrageous musicals ever put on the big screen
3,al pacino kim basinger tea leoni ryan oneal richard schiff my mouth was watering i dropped everything to watch this movie on cable 30 minutes in i was having trouble staying awake 60 minutes in and i hit the record button and fell asleep finished watching it the next morning shouldnt have bothered what a waste of a great cast and an idea that could have been an interesting story of a day in the life cure your insomnia if you have it and watch this movie i guarantee you at least an hour and a half of uninterrupted sleep dialogue horrible continuity nonexistent camera work could have been done with a hand held super and looked better br br this movie was a total disaster
7,after coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes though i guess not if the first one wasnt bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch with all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever though they couldnt they had to take all the same raunchy not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again though the thing is i didnt laugh at it the first time they tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level most of the time its just randomly inserted jokes that are so disgusting and raunchy that its hard to watch it and enjoy it then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience well i fit into the age range that its supposed to be funny for while people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not if you do find this funny then you probably arent one of the more mature or intelligent people around it doesnt take that much skill to write that kind of a script though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie spaceballs its a movie parody thats actually good and well done and it didnt have to use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny either
7,japanese indie film with humor and philosophy where the three main characters run literally almost through the entire film chasing each other due to strange circumstances and comical coincidence as they are running we see what is going on in their minds and how they got where they are at the moment the act of running is a metaphor for these downontheir luck peoples lives in some way what theyre really chasing for is not what they were originally chasing but for meaning in their lives and an escape from their personal problems and broken dreams running makes them all feel truly alive the big lifealtering running adventure comes to an end when they accidentally get in the middle of something big violent and so absurd that its funny in a clever way one of my favorite films of all time by genius director sabu
2,the first half was ok but the last half really really disappointed its funny the producers even admitted they didnt have a clue for the ending and it really showed whats really sad is i have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post this i really didnt want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks since the show isnt really worth that effort when battlestar galatica first came out i was really excited with the prospect of a better remake it didnt happen that first season border on being space porn they eventually cleaned it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama so i started watching again but to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel same with baltar and six was pretty dumb
5,i love this film the noir imagery combined with spillanes no nonsense character mike hammer works marvellously to create a mood and feel seldom found in low budget detective films of the early fifties it may not be the maltese falcon but this film makes its own solid contribution to the genre spillane is often criticised for alleged misogyny etc but his dames are way above their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence poor old mike hammer as effectively played by biff elliott is blinded by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist whom he meets when investigating the death of an army buddy when the penny finally drops his face is a picture good to see that 50s censorship did not force the film makers to omit the famous last line a bona fide low budget classic
6,i think that movie cant be a scotts film that is impossible do you remember blade runner and alien two greats movies versus a one i hope didnt see ever it good bye
0,this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the british film industry but the talentless hacks at work today not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of british actors so what went wrong i dont know and simply i dont care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot a nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and coworker out of his fathers company and thus leads to an encounter with the russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid very stupid plot twistsdevices i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather what about lock stock thats the peak of the contemporary british crime film
3,this movie is a lot better than the asylums version mainly its war of the worlds the tripods look pretty cool but their walking and deaths could have been better the action scenes were really cool walking walkingwalkingwalking oh my god stop walking please or im going to kill myself the thunder child scene was my favorite sequence mainly because a ship rammed bunch of tripods good movie i recommend it for people ho have read the book the music is awesome and the directors cut looks pretty coolbr br pros good soundtrack 99 to the book cool violence tripods and handling machines are cool to look atbr br cons some bad acting cheesy looking london
1,what the hell is in your minds  this film sucks  each minute i was getting more and more bored i strove to watch the end because i hope something at least would at last happen  but instead of that i got amazed how dull the end was treated what is this story about this bloody bogeyman  how comes he doesnt die  he is a bloody human being for gods sake  a mere boy that killed his silly sister 15 years ago then what  his stay on a psychiatric hospital made him immortal  this film a fascinatingly stupid its a must of silliness im gonna resell it right now to some silly guy who will understand this silly film
6,horrorscifi that is interesting as it is laughable fx pretty goodfor what you manage to see a made for tv thriller that is not as bad as the worst of them jeffrey coombs plays a brilliant although misguided scientist that tampers with stem cell research and manipulates human dna with that of a hammerhead shark the horrifying results give birth to one hell of a killing machine a group of scientists led by william forsythe and hunter tylo are invited to a remote island to check out the brilliant new experiment of course after laughing and stammering in awecoombs creation by the way is his own son fused with a hammerhead is let loose to hunt down one by one his fathers colleagues revenge is not always rewarding also in the cast elsie muller gr johnson arthur roberts and velizar binev
7,first off ill be the first to admit that the scarecrow himself is quite a bit overthetop a toned down maybe less acrobatic scarecrow wouldve made this movie much less cheesy but overall i think its one of the better bmovies tiffany shepis is absolutely wonderful not to mention incredibly beautiful though this movie is missing the allimportant nude factor there are several other movies at which to view her but here she gets all evilhotness especially towards the end as shes walking away from the engulfed scarecrow also richard elfman does a great job as sheriff and as the drunk boyfriend yes its a low budget bmovie but out of all of them ive seen this is definitely one of my very top favorites
0,what an unusual moviebr br absolutely no concessions are made to hollywood special effects or entertainment there is no background music not special effects or enhanced soundbr br facial expressions are usually covered by thick beards and the spanish language is a strange monotonic lilt that sounds the same whether in the midst of a battle or talking around a campfirebr br i sort of viewed these movies parts and as an educational experience not really something to go and get entertained by its quite long and in places dullbr br but i suspect that given the lack of any plot development i dont think its very educational eitherbr br its also difficult to perceive any story from the movie dialogue  it would be a good idea to read up a little on the history so that you can understand the context of what is happening since for some reason the director didnt see fit to inform the audience why ches band was moving around the way they did  as a result there seem to be groups skulking around the woodland for no particular reason and getting shot atbr br i would have loved to give this movie more stars for somehow generating more empathy with me and developing depth of character but somehow all of the characters were still strangers to me at the end the stars it gets are for realism and showing the hardships of guerrilla warfare
6,i rented this film from netflix for two reasons  i was in the mood for what i thought would be a silly 50s scifiasco and because it is the first featurelength superman film needless to say after about 15 minutes i found myself thoroughly engaged and very pleasantly surprisedbr br an experimental oil well has penetrated about six miles into the earth and is being shut down by the sponsor lois and clark show up to get the scoop but are disappointed that the deepest well ever drilled will no longer be in operation a day later strange events at the well make for a story more appropriate for superman than clark kent it seems that the radioactive mole men have invaded from their sixmile deep home near the earths corebr br supermen and the mole men is a simplistic but wellmade piece of social realism released in 1951 starring a lead actor who served in world war ii the moral of the story seems to be that americans are just as capable of becoming fascists as anybody else to drive this point home in a typically straightforward superman manner reeves even accuses the lynch mob hunting the mole men of being nazis at one pointbr br even in the 1950s the science underlying this film was nonexistent six miles of drilling through continental crust would not have even penetrated the upper mantle let alone the hollow center of the earth  which in any case does not exist forgivable  keep in mind that this film is based on a golden age comic bookbr br the film is a little unevenly paced although the molemen are interesting a bit creepy and nicely portrayed there are several cormanesquire scenes which spend too much time redundantly showing us their odd behavior the script is intelligent and economical by todays standards the costuming is poor to fair but for its time this films special effects and costuming were quite good the cinematography is also generally very good and the acting is much better than one might expect i was particularly impressed with reeves jeff corey and walter reed
4,i am not so much like love sick as i image finally the film express sexual relationship of alex kik sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness frustration and jealous at last alex waked up and realized that they would not have result and futureending up was sadbr br the director tudor giurgiu was in amc theatre on sunday 1200pm on 081006 with us watched the movie together after the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of romanian were kind of complicatebr br on my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere i dont feel any particular impression and effect from the movie the love proceeding of alex and kiki and kiki and her brother sandu were kind of next door neighborhood storybr br the two main reasons i dont like this movie are firstly the film didnt told us how they started to fall in love sounds like after alex moved into the building which kiki was living then two girls are fall in love it doesnt make sense at all how a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man too much fragments you need to image and connect those stories by your mind secondly the whole film didnt have a scene of alex and kiks sexual intercourse that s what i was waiting for however it still had some parts were deserved to recommend the ear piercing  part was kind of interesting alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kiks love that was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love also the scene of they were lying in the soccer field the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate
1,first lets all agree that lorenzo lamas could never be considered a skilled actor barely even decent sometimes just plain lousy however in this piece of  called snakeeater the film industry as a whole sankbr br first lets start with the plot a vietnam vet named jack kelly aka soldier who is supposed to be as tough as a strap of leather and then some which you can believe when he shoves a palate of nails through guys feet and pins them to the floor gets word that his family has been killed and his sister kidnapped therefore he goes on a solo mission to save his sister had some potential but still pretty thin to begin withbr br now the acting being an actor myself i am qualified to say that this was some of the worst acting in the history of the art lamas is well himself the jackasses playing the clampetsdeliverance rejects should be strung up and shot for their socalled performances which are insulting to actors everywhere especially talented ones who never get their big breakbr br finally the action the gunfighting is soso at best and the fistfighting is deplorable ive seen more reallooking fights at the renaissance festival and those were pretty fakelookingbr br readers listen to me avoid this piece of caca at all costs if it were the only film in existence you still would want to avoid it for the sake of your braincell count do not watch this thing
6,im sure that not many people outside of australia have ever heard of the legend of ned kelly i once saw a documentary about the man but thats the only time i once saw or heard anything about him and i guess that this might be the biggest problem this movie will have to face noone knows anything about it and probably not many people will care about the subjectbr br the movie tells the story of ned kellys life the irish immigrant has lived in northwest victoria all his life but has never been very welcome by the authorities the police always accuses him of everything they can think of and they keep harassing his family when kelly is fed up with the way everything goes he forms a gang with his brother and two other men they start robbing banks and even hijack an entire town for days all this violence leads to a man hunt organized by the police and when they kill three policemen they are outlawed finally they take over a pub in glenrowan where they have a party with all the visitors waiting for a train full of police to derail at a part of the track that they tore up but the train is able to stop in time because someone warns them and what will follow is a battle on life and death between the police and the four gunmenbr br its very hard to tell whether all of what is shown in the movie is true or false i guess nobody really knows because there will always be two camps who will each tell their own truth one camp says he was a hero some kind of robin hood the others will say he was an ordinary criminal a murderer and a thief i really couldnt tell you which of them is right perhaps both are but what i can tell you is that the facts in the movie as well as is the documentary were about the samebr br this movie was a nice addition to the documentary i once saw and i really enjoyed the performances of all the actors heath ledger orlando bloom naomi watts geoffrey rush are all actors who are pretty well known but even the lesser known actors show in this production that they all know what good acting should look like i really enjoyed this movie and i give it a 7510
5,why did i waste my money on this on the last day of sundance i want a refund can i have my 16 back while i was watching this film i kept waiting for something to happen nothing did happen the only way i even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot which was not really like the film why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out it was not very artistic why did the director show lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading or was that the point i felt like phantom love had no story at all and to be honest i felt like my friends vacation videos had a much higher entertainment value than this film
0,this was without a doubt the worst thing i have ever spent money on i feel dirty for admitting that i rented this movie and actually paid money to see it this does not even rate trash no no this is the juice that collects at the bottom of industrial dumpsters located in particularly foul neighborhoods after an extraordinarily humid summer to call it trash would be to degrade trash everywhere it was so bad i felt i had to register at imdb and warn my fellow man this luvahire character claims this movie is great one has to question his grasp on reality lets take some of his comments and analyze thembr br the actor who played ricky i forgot his name did a very good jobbr br i see well if the director envisioned his audience cringing and wincing at every sentence uttered by ricky or alternately bursting into uncontrollable laughter at moments when most directors would want a more somber reaction from their viewers then yes ricky did an outstanding jobbr br im an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and i had to do a play where i had to cry and its not easy to be emotional in a scene so i give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it offbr br wow i too must give props to actors who can pull off emotional scenes luvahire you may want to look into another line of work there buddy if you think these chuckleheads pulled it off still they can help you if you need to practice crying just watch the movie ha ha ha br br bring on the sequelbr br if i was your theater teacher at school id fail you based solely on this comment alonebr br i am too disgusted to continue i shall now turn over the movie bashing to my associate mr bangla br br howdy if youve continued to read this far i take it for granted that youve already seen the movie and youre now looking for one of two things in this comment additional vitriolic debasement of what you agree was an exceptionally poor movie additional vitriolic debasement of what you feel was a good cinematic effort which needs defending against such libelous scum as myself whether you want help articulating your disgust or ammunition for a stirring repartee if i say anything good itll only disappoint youso let me assure you there is little chance of such disappointment br br the other negative comments here at imdb have already enumerated the particular failings of the movie eg the acting the soundtrack the directing the dialogue the editing etc however all of these faults can readily be forgiven in and of themselves few people will rent a movie titled hood of the living dead if they require these elements to be topnotch the ultimate failure of hood however is its failure to deliver on the abundant promise of its name hood of the living dead practically leaps off the shelf at the video store with its implications of corny oneliners and gruesomely creative kills here was a chance to mix the cheesy gore of the zombie movie with the realism of life in the ghetto to have gangstathug zombies bombin on the innocent living while rockin dorags to have undead pimps drivin over alltoomortal police in their trickedout rides the mixture of the two genres could have been hilarious instead the movie is more like watching middle school kids timidly deliver the lines to a play they are performing but dont understand to avoid a feeling of betrayal on the part of their videorental audience i suggest that the quiroz brothers rerelease the movie with the following new title hood of the living dead a homemade horror video we shot on our camcorder with some friends over a weekend last summer because we were bored or perhaps they could release it as a documentary the day creativity died an exploration of how a low budget movie can still be perfectly devoid of clever or original thought despite lacking ties to a major motion picture studio br br the potential renter whose interest has not been quelled should find the following blurb on the back of the video case the quiroz brothers have proved once again that watching things which you can easily do yourself is not very interestingmr bangla
2,ouch what a painfully boring scifi movie and thats especially saddening because the opening 15 minutes were so actionpacked and full of potential during the intro we follow a bunch of nervous security officers and hired hit men as they chase a doctor who escaped from a mysterious laboratory with a briefcase full of topsecret files as hes about to reveal the supposedly horrible  inhuman events that take place in the lab hes executed figures from then on the action swifts back and forth between two locations the aforementioned laboratory and the rural mansion of a corrupt senator or something and it quickly becomes clear that the experiments are actually the complete opposite of disturbing more like dull pointless and vague scientists selected four random persons without living relatives and its really really really really important that they speak the truth even though a giant machine reads the content of their minds anyway they all hide dark secrets from their pasts and people suffer when get revealed yet i fail to see how these tests could ever result in a humanitythreatening device perhaps i missed something but i doubt it the interactions between the patients and doctors are even less interesting to follow as really none of them have personalities so basically the brain machine just handles about a bunch of lame people living in an awfully decorated room the film also could have been half an hour shorter if it werent for a thousand stagnant shots of buildings the relocations from the lab to the villa and vice versa are indicated every single time by a fivesecond shot of the places either the makers really needed the padding or they just assumed that all scifi viewers are morons unable to notice a change of location by themselves staring at a forsaken pool with a mansion in the background for the tenth time in only five minutes becomes quite annoying i assure you james bests performance as the reverend with mental issues is rather decent but one man definitely cant save this thing from being an absolute waste of time avoid
2,i have no idea how a texan the director douglas mcgrath and the american actress gwyneth paltrow ever pulled this off but seeing this again will remind you what all the fuss about ms paltrow was in the first place i had long since gone off the woman and still feel she is rather dull in her oscarwinning shakespeare in love performance but she gets all the beats right hereshe is nigh on perfect as emma woodhouse she may have won her oscar for shakespeare but she should be remembered for thisbr br of course shes surrounded by a great supporting cast including toni collette greta scacchi juliette stevenson et aljeremy northam is very appealing as the love interest even if the script wallows a bit in his declaration of love to paltrow in the process allowing all of the tension to drain out of their relationship several years on ewans hair is a little easier to take than it was in 96 and personally i find puckish alan cumming a grating presence in anything nowadays but the standout is without a doubt sophie thompson sister of emma thompson daughter of phyllida law as miss bates what this version needs is a scene where emma reconciles with miss bates as she is the character to whose fate we are drawn the film is worth watching again even for her performance alonebr br all in all this has aged wonderfully with charm to spare and more than enough subtlety to sort out the british class system well worth a rental because its unlikely that paltrow will ever be this good againbut well always have emma
0,i have to agree with most everyones opinion that this show was poorly produced as well as writtenthe acting was not much more above the lower production values however i feel an actor can only rely on the material provided to them and make the best of it in keeping with this thought i feel it is important to point out that one actor has risen and persevered well beyond this campy to tasteless production to have become a respectable and quite talented performeri am referring to laura harris a canadian born actor who has etched her way through many poorly produced shows and movies to find a place on the hbo hit dead like me where she plays the role of daisy adair and to her credit she handles this role in an efficient manneri remember having a typical boyhood crush on the young actress during this series where she played ashley a soft spoken yet intelligent 7th graderi felt as though if anyone might make it from this series it surely would be laura harris and true to her nature she did excel in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique nordic blond allure if you ever do have the opportunity to view this series i recommend that you have something epic to watch after wards such as the godfather or perhaps beaches in order to remind yourself that there is after all a great deal of true production integrity and value out there and that this series is only a lowbudget reminder of what laura harris can simply state about her time on the show and i bet she would quote many a young actors words of defense by saying its a start
6,your mind will not be satisfied by this nobudget doomsday thriller but pray whos will a youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as church peoplebr br small _apocalyptically themed outing end of the world has the ingenuity and the lack of both brio and style of the purely 50s similar movies and its not only that but eotw plays like a hybridnot only doomsday but convent creeps as well the villain of the movie is a wellknown character actorbr br this wholly shameless slapdash seems a piece of conventexploitation that significantly 70s genre which looks today so amusingly outdated anyway the convents secret laboratory is some nasty piece of futuristic deco christopher lee is the pride of end of the world but the end of the world is not at all his pride
6,as an antifootball person i on the surface grudgingly took my younger brother to see this film although secretly i hoped it might be east is east ii the trailers looked fun so i thought id give it a gobr br it took about ten minutes but after that i was glued to the screen and that wasnt anything to do with the neck cramp caused by sitting too near the front due to a packed auditorium the acting was fresh and vibrant the characters engaging and the jokes genuinely funny the entire auditorium was laughing out loud every minute or so football fan or no football fan sport became irrelevant to the main principles of love friendship family independence and rivalry add a dash of sikh culture and you have the formula for the best british comedy ive seen in a long time dare i say it better than east is eastbr br this film trots along nicely at a lovely pace never dwelling on anything longer than necessary nor leaving anything unfinished keeping the viewer entertained and mentally engaged though not a characteristically twistingandturning film there are some pleasant surprises on the way and things dont always happen as you would expectbr br saying that there were elements of predictability but these were exploited satirically more than used as scriptfillers i suppose depending on your particular penchant for happyendings you could be either delightedlet down by the ending personally if there was any other outcome i would have written a strongly worded letter to the script writersbr br as for the actors i would have to say that juliet stevenson paula put in the finest performance i never knew that people like that existed but she her realism with sometimes bizarre concepts has convinced me that they possibly do prize for the most unconvincing of the main characters goes unfortunately to kiera knightley jules but dont get me wrong even she offered a great performance its just that someone has to be last of the best and sorry kiera this time youre itbr br tip dont leave before the credits once the lights came back up i realised to my horror that perhaps i shouldnt have watched this film after all my beloved but forgotten ice junkie had melted into a sugary blue juice oh what am i saying it was absolutely brill and i cant recommend it enough i will definitely buy it when it comes out and add it to my collection of videos im a student i only splash out if its really worth it
1,wow how bad can it get this was seriously bad not in terms of the gore  which was mainly laughable cgi  but in acting atmosphere and directionbr br the story was dreadful  the character arc of the main lead was a total joke within a few nights of stalking vinnie jones he starts to become haunted to the point of crying when photographing his girlfriend um are all new york photographers this childish suggestible and weak his character development had absolutely no justification or point whatsoever  and by the very end youll be laughing out loud at the utterly predictable and totally absurd twist his character takesbr br the gory moments were clearly just a weak lowselfesteemed effort to jump onto the modern mtv style gore wagon  all cgi blood yet no real emotion whatsoever these parts were unintentionally funny  and distracting by their selfconsciousness  wacky camera angles etcbr br overall this film commits the crime of blowing another potential idea what could have had atmosphere until the stupid monsters at the end is ruined in favour of look at mestyle selfconscious directing this film wasnt made for and audience  it was made for a cv  a deeply selfish motive

5,some spoilers i have not read the james m cain novel the postman always rings twice on which this movie was based so i cannot compare this film version to it but i have seen and love the 1946 us version also entitled postmanbr br even better is this gem from italy which i have read was mutilated in editing because of too many blatant references to the fascist regime well no matter  what is left is a fine piece of cinema apparently the forerunner of the neorealist movement in filmmaking one can certainly see why  despite whatever harsh editing did go on a pervading sense of societal and cultural as well as personal oppression remains hanging heavy over the protagonists who therefore face many limits in lifebr br consider gino the young drifter not well educated unemployed and resorting to stowing away stealing and conning people in order to get by his one pair of shoes so threadbare as to be virtually uselessbr br in giovanna he sees a way out yet he should have kept going as giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage to an older man with some money her job working at the trattoria for her husband slaving away behind the bar and in the kitchen and her sex in the past she had limited options and decided to marry the restaurantgas station owner giuseppe bregana played by juan de landa anyway knowing that he would not make her happy she tells gino that she feels sick every time bregana touches herbr br on the pretext of helping bregana fix his car and sending him into the village to buy a needed part which he has in fact pocketed gino wins breganas favor promising also to fix the broken water pump  water symbolizing life or lack thereof and is left alone with giovanna they immediately start a heated passionate yet volatile love affairbr br gino soon feels stifled by the relationship and feels the need to move on again when giovanna proposes that they dispose of her husband wanting no part of it gino leaves town on a train ride that he cannot afford kindly paid for him by another gypsytype man named spagnolo a fellow train passenger to gino spagnolo represents a sort of freedom and they become friends spagnolo also symbolizes ginos morality and conscience traveling and finding work at a carnival together finally gino has steady employment to his dismay he is not yet over his love for giovanna a month has passed when bregana and his wife go to the carnival and bregana persuades gino to go back home to live and work with them again as he is handy to have aroundbr br too weakwilled to resist knowing this will reunite he and giovanna gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple after a while he gives in to ginas demands to get rid of her husband once the evil deed is done giovanna becomes more coldblooded than ever seeming to have very little conscience while guilt and shame eat away at gino for hurting a man who never did him any harm as much as he wants to leave her  he does again briefly they are now inextricably linked and must face the consequencesbr br i liked the way the spagnolo character came back into ginos life to act as a judge of his misdeeds  that was very good and interesting adding another dimension to the storybr br while the 46 us version with lana turner and john garfield gets a bit lost in a quagmire of peripheral characters especially the cops and the lawyers ossessione does well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of the crime on the lovers alone this gives the final outcome even more potency and makes a powerful statement reinforcing the helplessness inherent in the society in which the characters must livebr br a minor quibble the amount of time hardly any that elapses before undying love is pronounced by the lovers how quickly they kill the husband there is no botched first attempt as in the us version ginos very quicktoescalate relationship with the dancerhooker  they quickly profess their love as well and she is willing to risk a great deal for a man she just met  all rather unrealistic isnt it i found this timeframe problem quite distracting  it made me think that i must have missed something somewhere otherwise well worth the viewers time the acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout recommended
7,spoilers many different comedy series nowadays have at one point or another experimented with the idea of obscure independence in an early episode of cartoon family guy the griffin family find their home is an independent nation to the united states of america and the story progresses from there way back in 1949 however the ealing studios produced a wonderful little film along the same ideabr br after a childs prank the residents of pimlico discover a small fortune in treasure at the inquest it becomes clear that the small area is a small outcrop of the long lost state of burgundy withdrawing from london and the rest of great britain the residents of the small street experience the joys and the problems with being an independent statebr br based at a time when rationing was still in operation this story is brilliantly told and equally inspiring featuring performances by stanley holloway betty warren philip stainton and a young charles hawtrey the film is well stocked with some of the finest actors of their generation these actors are well aided as well by a superb little script with some cracking lines feeling remarkably fresh despite being over 50 years old the story never feels awkward and always keeps the audience entertainedbr br ealing studios was one of the finest exporters of british film ever in existence with films like passport to pimlico its not difficult to see why amusing from start to finish the story is always fun and always worth watching
0,modern original romantic storybr br very good acting of both nicole kidman and ben chaplinbr br miss kidman does a nice job in imitating a russian accent ben chaplin is also good as the shy dull clerk for the men and some women  miss kidman looks fantastic and is very sympathetic i forgot what a gorgeous woman she is its not hard to imagine that john falls in love with her some unexpected turns in the story are good for the suspense although i hoped for a happy ending the last part of the movie was quite a surprise for me br br conclusion  good movie br br les paysbas  huit points
6,nyc model alison parker cristina raines rents a room in an old brownstone where she meets a few bizarre neighbors and experiences some creepy hallucinations as lawyer boyfriend michael lerman chris sarandon goes about making inquiries on her behalf she struggles to maintain her sanity not to mention her will to live as her experiences take a toll on her physical mental and emotional healthbr br i dont want to spoil the better moments in this psychological horror film for those unfamiliar with it the story is interesting and entertaining but the film doesnt really offer much in terms of real scares or for that matter any atmosphere it is sort of quietly sinister but its not like the traditional horror film its more of a story about a troubled womans attempts to deal with the increasing unreality in her life on that level it works but its not quite powerful enoughbr br what the sentinel does offer are some eyecatching set pieces in particular the fascinating fabulously creepy climax and theres a scene with beverly dangelo that must be seen to be believed theres also some gore to be seen but not very much an ominous music score by gil melle adds to the menacebr br no review of this film would be complete without an appraisal for the filmmakers in gathering such excellent actors for its ensemble cast some of them dont get to do too much but to see all of them together is impressive eli wallach and burgess meredith make the biggest impressions as respectively a hardnosed detective and a solicitous neighbor other legendary names include jose ferrer arthur kennedy and ava gardner future stars like dangelo christopher walken tom berenger jeff goldblum make brief appearances and other familiar faces include jerry orbach sylvia miles william hickey and martin balsam whoever was the casting director for this film deserves some sort of prizebr br written for the screen by director michael winner probably best known for the death wish series that he did with charles bronson from the novel by jeffrey konvitzbr br i wouldnt consider this a truly great horror thriller but it has its moments and is reasonably entertainingbr br 710
7,gee what a crappy movie this was i cannot understand what people find so scary about the grudge the director plays one trick id have to admit a very good one that is brought to life very stylized and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again as a consequence i startled a few times in the first quarter of the movie but once i knew the drill i practically fell asleep as the grudge grew more and more predictable by the minute to conclude i can say that there are a lot better movies in the genre to begin with that the socalled predecessor the ring was way scarier and that buying a ticket for the grudge is a waste of money
1,the soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he might punish everyone involved in the desecration of his tomb the soul transference makes the young man age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy one by one the blood is drained from those involved in the digbr br to be as brief as possible pharaohs curse is quite the lackluster affair while the movie does present a few good original ideas blood sucking mummys soul transference interesting makeup effects the arm ripping scene etc and a few atmospheric moments the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding to make matters even worse the first 15 of the films relatively short 66 minute runtime consist of nothing much more than padding i usually go for these slow moving mummy movies but pharaohs curse tests even my patients the cast helps very little with only one exception ziva rodann is the lone bright spot  wish the movie could have focused more on her mysterious character the cast is as dull as the screenplay finally i dont know whose idea it was to put the mummylooking servant in what appears to be pajamas but its a laughable ridiculous look for a creature that supposed to instill fear in the audiencebr br despite my mostly negative comments on the pharaohs curse im going to rate it a 410 not a good rating to be sure but generous given all the problems i have with the movie
6,i was lucky enough to get to see this film many years ago in england ive seen hundreds of films sincebut ive never forgotten this onealthough sinatra was playing a not very endearing characterhe was excellent in the rolea lot of people seem to think that he didnt really come into his own until his role in from here to eternity but in my opinion he was magnificent in conchothe other role that sticks in my mind is that of william conradid never see or heard of him before this film conrad plays a terrific part in this filmi remember his deep and gravelly voice and he uses it beautifully to enhance the few words he speaks with a menace that sets the tone of his characteralso i remember the music that both introduces conrad and and seems to surround him whenever he appearsan excellent film and my only disappointment was that i never ever got the chance to see it again it seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth i see in the titles that it says that the film is in black and white but when i saw it was indeed in full color i remember sinatras blue shirt
5,dance fools dance is an early crawfordgable vehicle from 1931 crawford plays a bonnie jordan a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties booze and stripping off her clothes to jump from a yacht and go swimming this all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother william blakewell penniless bonnie gets a job on a newspaper using the name mary smith her brother goes to work for bootleggers the head man is jake luva  portrayed by clark gable as he plays yet another crook later of course he would turn into a romantic hero but in the early 30s mgm used him as a bad guy not realizing that her brother is involved in illegal activity bonnie cozies up to luvabr br gable and crawford made a great team her facial expressions are a little on the wild side but that along with her dancing is one of the things that makes the movie fun look for cliff edwards the voice of jiminy cricket as bertbr br its always interesting to see the precode movies and dance fools dance is no exception
4,this movie shows us nothing original every idea or action scene can be found in many previously released movies fabulous nick is completely plain here even will patton is calm and evil nor good mr duvall is ok but has a very small part so does angelina so how can we determine her newly acclaimed stardom overall there are too many characters so that nobody and nothing is especially detailed this makes the movie easy to forget too bad dont you think
7,watching der himmel ber berlin as a teen in the late 80s was a profound experience for me  so this was what the movies could be along with paris texas and until the end of the world it still holds a special place in my heart and mind  a testament to the genius of wim wendersbr br unfortunately later years has seen a steady decline in the quality of his work with million dollar hotel and land of plenty hitting a terrible low point gone are the captivating pictures or music no search for or display of great insight all that is left are characters and thinly veiled political statements that boils down to nothing but clichs and quite frankly mock the intelligence of a mature audiencebr br has the well run dry whatever the reason its time for mr wenders to either step it up or stop altogether
7,this is a long lost horror gem starring sydney lassick carrie and others and barbara bach it is sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this film but its worth it this film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time it seems that young newswomen karen vicky and jennifer travel to the small city of solvang california to cover a festival when a mixup occurs involving their hotel room and they seek refuge at the home of earnest keller lassick and his strange wife virginia vickie stays behind feeling ill as the other are off to film their story she is soon murdered at the house in a very cheesy way by some unknown force hiding in the ventilation system she is decapitated by the closing cover of the vent as it comes crashing down on her while she is being tugged through and into the basement soon karen returns and she is murdered in an even more brutal fashion by having her face rammed through the vent cover jennifer is fighting with her exlover in a rather boring sub plot and when she returns home her hosts whom by now we have discovered are brother and sister and that whatever it is that is in the basement is their son devise a plot to try to murder her as well virgina does not totally agree with earnests plan to murder jennifer but she is tricked into going into the basement where she meets junior here the film turns almost comic as junior portrayed hysterically by stephen furst is a deformed mentally deficient manchild whose actions and motions will cause a few chuckles even though its supposed to be scary this is where the pace of the film picks up and the ending is well done the actorsactresses do a terrific job with the material especially lassick furst and bach and although its not the most horrifying film ever made it is highly entertaining
7,having been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last christmases i feel adequately qualified to pass judgment on this version of dr seuss classic tale and well its not very good first off following a classic act like chuck jones animated tv special is going to be difficult for anyone but this interpretation is so heavyhanded and padded as to be positively numbing i will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags but overall the film comes off as a calculated cash grab at the same time as it is supposedly decrying the commercialisation of christmas jim carrey is typically over the top here but that is completely at odds with the character of the grinch as characterised by boris karloff he was a slow burn methodical and sly there is no method to carreys madness and that is only the most obvious error made talented actors like jeffrey tambor and christine baranski are utterly wasted here why universal why i mean  i understand that tony hopkins will take just about any role offered much like his countryman michael caine but this one needs to be filed under films that should never have been made this does not bode well for the cat in the hat an even thinner tome that universal is prepping for this christmas i get the feeling that i will be making the same recommendation for that one as i am with this one skip it and either read the book or watch the tv special this is hours you can never ever get back
0,the movie is about two stories one is a political murder of a callgirl the other an upperclass political party the crossing point is the public relation character played by al paccino as he is the witness of the crime and the instigator of the eveningbr br if the script is terrible without any decent dialogs and the directing void of any sense of drama the performance of al is memorable how many fellows can be as much convincing as a powerful and feared man as the godfather as here as a little servant see also donnie brascobr br actually the big young lion has become a tired old one this passing of ages is very moving because it makes the audience ponders about getting old toobr br but his slowness is only a makeup because he can get back his energy in church scenebr br maybe it is a good thing that the movie is so awful because it put the starlight on als talent
4,ever wanted to know just how much hollywood could get away with before the hayes code was officially put into effect well unfortunately convention city is lost so well just have to watch tarzan and his mate to find out for 1934 there is a remarkable amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed flesh just look at janes nude swim while tarzan is often thought of as badventure films made for young boys and no one else this picture proves that the series was originally very adult over seventy years later it is still as sexy as it was when it came outbr br in addition to the envelope pushing taboo nature it is a superb and exciting adventure story ive always enjoyed the jungle films that hollywood churned out in the 30s and the 40s but there are few from the genre id call great films tarzan and his mate is by far the best film from this long gone subgenre the sequences of the attacks on the safari by either apes or natives still manage to create tension today also the animals are all too cool espescially the apes throwing boulders the acting wont win any major awards soon but is certainly more than adequate for this type of picture the film is once again stolen by cheetah the smartest monkey in the jungle one of the most entertaining examples of precode hollywood out there
2,trying to cash in on the success of deal or no deal and versus 100 comes this lame excuse for entertainment  show me the money in which 12 sexy dancers shimmy out in shiny red hooker attire a contestant is given the beginning of a phrase such as which team lost    with three choices a b or c each which completes the phrase the contestant has three chances to give an answer to one of these choices the host  william shatner at his obnoxious smarmiest  asks the contestant if he wants to lock into the answer and when the contestant says yes he picks a dancer to whom he yells show me the money she opens a scroll that has an amount and if his answer was right he adds that amount to his winnings if he was wrong the amount is subtracted so theoretically it is possible for a contestant on this dreary debacle to actually wind up owing shatner money there is also a killer card and if the contestant picks the girl who has that vile scroll but he has answered properly nothing happens if hes answered wrong the game goes into sudden death and has to answer another question if he gets that one wrong he leaves with nothingbr br before going to commercials shatner yells lets dance and shatner the contestant and the 12 dancers shake booty at the end of the show shatner asks the ladies for a last dance and they all shake it some morebr br i give this show episodes at the very most at which time hopefully this pathetic excuse for a game will be shown the door it couldve been worse  they couldve somehow bribed cuba gooding jr to be the host although i bet hes a better dancer than shat as they call him these daysbr br 708 guess what  i was wrong it lasted for only episodes there is hope for the world
2,every movie from the thirties is dated but if you were to watch only john ford movies it would seem more dated than if you watched others ie grand hotel is comparatively modern melodrama with ford theres always the hardsell of someones nobility abe the joads always the overemphasis of some heavys badness always the poorly crafted awkward and obvious scripts this is no exception its just a rather belabored device to deliver sentiment and sentiment is all this has going for itbr br what ford does here doesnt make me appreciative of lincoln it just makes me wonder how the states were ever settled by the population of complete morons depicted here ford went on to make decent movies this is too dated to be anything but bad it feels entirely false br br henry fonda with a fake nose is bizarre and no one from illinois would pronounce the trailing s or say shonuff
6,jude law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire flick which offers little else of value completely lacking in eroticism excitement or leading ladies with appeal one decent fight a few moments of mild suspense and a onenote plotbr br the movie waxes philisophic in a series of conversations between laws character and a dogged homicide detective well played by timothy spall but despite their best efforts both actors are staked to the cross of the films banalitybr br with a lesser actor in the lead role  and without the benefit of oliver curtiss cinematography  crocodiles would blend into the sea of lowbudget vampire quickies
0,i really have problems rating this movie it is directed brilliantly there is obviously a lot of money in it gere and danes are intense although her screen personality could use a bit more defining and spicing up editing and cinematography are excellent on the other hand it is one of those really really sick movies where one cannot help but wonder whether the director himself likes to stage specific scenes and yes one cannot help but wonder how many copycats will such a movie inspirebr br in purely artistic terms it is a but i really have to ask myself who these people are giving their money to produce such a movie 
0,just the ultimate masterpiece in my opinion every line every phrase every picture is exactly in place and lindsay crouse and joe mantegna are just the cool shrink and the sleazy conman so well cast 10 out of 10
0,if any movie stands out extremely with the actors acting skills this is probably the one ive never seen dialogues be spoken in such a rough way but having a strong feeling the movie was disturbing at moments however the movie was terrible at editing the movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs yet they feel out of place like karisma is getting beat up and the same time srk is fighting comically with the police officers the ishq kamina song was very out of place on top of that the movie is overly glossy in the beginning the direction was not bad but certainly nothing one can brag aboutbr br i have to say that the actors were chosen very wisely without them this movie would not have an impact karisma kapoor has given her best role to date and this looks very good on her record after zubeidaa and fiza she looks pretty in the first half and ive never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her what is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date nana patekar was excellent as her fatherinlaw not much to say about him besides this is a role made for him deepti naval as the motherinlaw was excellent especially in her final scene though she doesnt have much to say her facial expressions and body language was good the other good performance was the little kid he was adorable and is sure to bring tears to the viewers eyes the movie was probably saved desperately by their performances sanjay kapoor was all right but he didnt have much to do shahrukh khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role br br one thing that brought the audience to the theater was ishq kamina the song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song and boy aish is mad hot however the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever people may have come to the movie for aish but they wont brag too much about it afterwards hum tum miley was properly paced but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie damroo bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about dil ne pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie despite the poor editing the performances alone make it a must see
7,when sam peckinpahs superlative the wild bunch 1969 opened the door to outrageous displays of graphic cinematic ultraviolence it did so with a talented if whiskymarinated hand guiding the camera and had a compelling story with characters who had actual depth but in no time flat there were scores of imitators that fell far from the benchmark set by peckinpahs epic and soldier blue definitely falls into that categorybr br soldier blew er blue tells the story of foulmouthed new yorker cresta lee candice bergen a blonde protohippie chick whos been rescued from two years of captivity among the cheyenne and is now being sent to a fort where shell be reunited with the fiance she only wants to marry for his money also on board the wagon shes traveling in is a shipment of government gold cash the cheyenne need to buy guns with so in short order the soldiers are wiped out and cresta flees to the hills accompanied by honus gant peter strauss the lone surviving cavalryman calling gant by the snarky nickname soldier blue cresta demonstrates that her years among the savages was time well spent outstripping gant in survival skills common sense and sheer balls and over their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements a band of hostile kiowa an unscrupulous trader  played by donald pleasance here giving one of his most ridiculous performances and thats saying something  and in the tradition of many previous westernset romantic comedies each otherbr br during the course of their misadventures the two opposites are inevitably  and predictably  attracted to each other and eventually end up getting it on  while gant has a freshly treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg no less  in what was surely the only conveniently located cave for at least a twelve mile radius that wasnt filled with rattlesnakes mountain lions or who knows what to say nothing of the cheyenne who could have done something really spiffy with such a primo apartment there i go thinking in nyc real estate terms again br br realizing that their love could never flourish outside of the cave cresta leaves gant and makes it to the fort by herself only to discover that the moron in charge wont spare a couple of men so they can rescue gant the regiment needs all available personnel to launch an attack on the nearby cheyenne village and once cresta gets wind of that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubbytobe and makes a beeline straight to the cheyenne to warn them of whats coming br br what happens next is what gained the film its infamy it turns out that all the wacky misadventures and squabbling were all just a leadin to a hideous reenactment of the 1864 sand creek massacre an orgy of rape torture and general sadistic evil perpetrated in the name of keeping the country clean and almost forty years after its release this sequence still disturbs and nauseates for its sheer cruelty children are trampled beneath the hooves of charging horses or impaled on bayonets unarmed people are beheaded  a nice effect i have to admit  women are stripped and pawed by gangs of slavering brutes then raped and mutilated  in one truly sickening instance a naked native woman puts up too much of a fight so her rapist instead decides to cut off her breasts which we thankfully only see the start of before the camera moves on to chronicle some other hideous act  and scores of innocent people are shot and dismembered their compone nt parts impaled on pikes and waved about in victorious celebration or kept as the most ghoulish of souvenirs no joke this scene would instantly garner an nc17 rating if released today to say nothing of possibly spurring native american interest groups to riot in the streets over the incredibly exploitative manner in which the atrocities are depictedbr br im all in favor of westerns that dont shy away from honest portrayals of how the west was won or stolen if truth be told but this film has no idea of what kind of movie it wants to be one minute its a heavyhanded pseudohippy lecture about how the treatment of the natives was totally effed up well duh then its a lighthearted battle of the sexes farce wherein cresta proves herself five times the man gant is and manages to look hot in her tasty red calico poncho with no undies but that all goes out the window when donald pleasance shows up with an unintentionally  hilarious pair of bucktoothed dentures and our heroes must figure out how to escape from his murderous clutches in a subplot that goes nowhere all of which culminates in the aforementioned apocalyptic climax any one of those tacks would have been okay for a coherent film but the end result is a slapdash mess that milked the horrors of its final ten minutes for all they were worth in the films promotion and poster imagery br br but by trying to be all things to all audiences soldier blue ends up as an incoherent preachy mulligan stew of presumably wellintentioned political correctness but if they were going to tell the story of the sand creek massacre wouldnt it have been a good idea to have some indian characters who were more than just walkons with murphy brown acting as their mouthpiece we get to know absolutely nothing of the people who get wiped out solely for what appears to be a crass ploy to lure gorehound moviegoers into seeing the most savage film in history if you like me were intrigued by the provocative ads and reviews that shower almost endless praise upon it for its daring to tell it like it was take my word for it and let soldier blue slowly fade into cinematic obscurity
6,i have seen this film several times and watched it today on tcm solely because of geraldine fitzgerald she is a much underrated actress and i have to admit i have had a crush on her since i first saw her probably in wuthering heights 40 or more years ago the real star in this movie however is paul lukas and he deserved all the accolades he got he makes it clear whether we like it or not that the end justifies the means naziism had to be stopped and anything that helped do it was good he gave his children a line about being bad and that they should not be bad but as he said earlier when conversing with adults he would do this sort of thing again without hesitation lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to dobr br some people think his victim was a nazi but i dont think so  i think he was only after the money his nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for himbr br one interesting point in the film and presumably also in the play is the fact that muller lucas is a german while the anti german hysteria of wwi was not repeated in wwii there was considerable antigerman sentiment and some germans were interred similar to what happened in california with people of japanese ancestry it was something of an act of bravery for hellman to write a play about good germans at this time maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the nazisoviet pact after all the us and british air forces were bombing german cities and having no qualms about killing innocent civilians i think however that the dresden bombing and firestorm happened later after watch on the rhine was releasedbr br the title is something of a play on words as the watch is looking west from germany in fact watch am rhein was a german army marching song  used in wwii but the nazis had their own marching song that was used as well but muller is a german and he is engaged in his own wach am rheinbr br all the other actors did an excellent job here although bodo was too much there are children like him i am surprised he did not give his fathers secret away in real life he may very well have done so
0,horrendous pillaging of a classicbr br it wasnt written convincingly at all why mary should develop such sympathy for bates he may be more stable until they start playing pranks with him but he still doesnt help himself at all with his actions inviting a comparative stranger to stay alone with him in his until recently disused motel telling the attractive young girl of his past mental issues lying about the knives etc  this in addition to her previous knowledge should have kept mary extremely wary of him but this somehow doesnt happen just so they can play the mistakenidentitymurdergame later on which in itself is also ridiculous soandso is the real killer  plus her as well  also him there were too many contrived twists in order to slap a story on screen when the narrative didnt need extendingbr br it was good to see perkins reprising his famous role again but thats about the only small pleasure to be had its definitely not a patch on hitchcock and if you have no intention of even trying to get close then you shouldnt be bothering at all
0,when my 14yearold daughter and her friends get together for movie night theres one movie they insist on watching over and over again you guessed it k911 the third installment in the highly successful k9 franchise starring everybodys favorite tv dad jim belushibr br folks i knew it was possible to wear out a vhs tape but a dvd this has been played so often that its starting to skip no joke but of course youll have that when you own a film so charming so brilliantbr br of course we have to thank the one and only tom hanks for introducing us to the beloved copdog genre with turner and hooch however even that film doesnt measure up to the sheer excellence presented in all three k9 moviesbr br some naysayers say belushi ran out of steam with this third movie in the series poppycock i say while you might suspect that a third installment  directtovideo at that  may not seem like something worth watching youd prove yourself wrong after watching this quality moviebr br i wont give away the plot but i will say that belushi and his panting partner give their best performance yet  one that will have you howling with laughter its a shame john belushi isnt alive to see what great strides his brother has made in the acting worldbr br i highly recommend your teenage daughter introduces this film to her bffs at her next slumber party dont forget the puppy chow
2,not only is this movie a great film for basic cinematography screenplay acting setting etc but also for its realism this movie could take place in any farm or rural setting it makes no difference if the movie takes place in louisiana or if it would take place in kansas the story and the messages it includes would remain the same this movie shows family values and connections for an older audience while at the same time it shows youthful behavior for the younger viewers everyone who watches this will walk away with something having touched them personally i know i did the ending hits way too close to home for me not to burst into tears every time i watch it the ending stresses the importance of farm safety and everyone who has ever worked on a farm needs to see this film not paying attention and carelessness gets you into dangerous situationsbr br 
3,okay just by reading the title you would think that it would be a good movie well at least i did it started out good but became so boring after the first half hour spoilerbr br it tells a story about a mother that is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will go to any lengths to get what she wants the only problem is that her daughters friend is the girl in the way she always wins the competitions therefore pushing the mother further towards eliminating her after talking to a hitman the mother decides that the girl needs to be roughed up a bit so actions are taken but she eventually gets caughtbr br the cast is awful and the movie drags on too long with nothing happening dont waste your time watching thisbr br 
6,this movie can be described in those words just unbelievable this is the best movie ever made i just cant see why this movie isnt in the top 250 i also cant see why anybody would not love scarface anyways if you havnt seen it it is a must buy
0,if you liked blair with youll like this one it has the same lousy camerawork and soundtrack and it has the same nonexistent plot and suspenseful momentsbr br it also has tom savini so if you like romeros dawn of the dead or tarantino and rodriguez from dusk till dawn youre in for a treat he is an icon and a very good actor as wellbr br no seriously this movie is definitely the lousiest movie ive seen in a long time and ive seen quite a few movies  bad ones as well i can tell you that i find most horror movies entertaining in some respect but this was just a pure waste of timebr br the only reason why i gave this movie instead of was the naked chicks and the hot action with all the sharplooking plastic teeth no im just kidding i must have missed before i hit submit on the vote formbr br stay away even though it has sexy girls with teeth on the cover
6,this sorry excuse for a film reminded me a great deal of what i heard about gigli that ben and jen flop earlier this summer the order was clearly edited to such an unconscionable degree that the scenes rather than forming a cohesive and provoking film appeared to be a collection of disconnected sequences that did little to forward any semblance of a unified plot now im a heath ledger fan 10 things i hate about you a knights tale and particularly his supporting role in monsters ball but my man needs to find himself a better agent keep accepting scripts like the order and four feathers and hes going to be on the fast track to movie oblivionbr br here are the problems i had with the film firstly the director tried to make up for the inadequacies of his essential plot by introducing two other plot lines that seemingly had little if anything to do with well much of anything plot skeins involving the american trying to take over the vatican and the dark pope while mildly interesting did nothing to reveal to the viewer anything about the main characters the attempts to tie these threads together were pathetic at best secondly please dont insult the intelligence of the viewer by inserting into the film scenes that are clearly obligatory we had manufactured angst manufactured love and most idiotically manufactured sex that seemed like a page right out of matrix reloaded with skullnumbing techno music rather than developing character these elements seemed like the cheap devices they clearly were a halfhearted attempt at putting popcornchewing adolescents in the seats thirdly and most importantly this movie seemed to ha ve an intriguing concept we have scandal we have religion and we have supernatural forces at play why then do we learn almost nothing about anyones background we learn a little about alex but even he gives up the passion of the priesthood to sleep with a woman after two days a woman who tried to kill him during an exorcism at some point in the past and alex is the most developed if you can call it that character in the entire filmbr br as the cliche goes nowadays if youre going to see one movie this year make sure its not this one theres about ten interesting minutes out of the intolerable 101 minute affair the only thing that saved me was going with a girl who im rather fond ofbr br out of 10 im disappointed file this one firmly under had potential but blew it on over editing and bad directing heath my man go back to monsters balllike cameos they really suit you
0,the poor dvd video quality is the only reason why i gave this movie a instead of a 10 that could have been so much better this movie deserves itbr br this is truly a movie that covers several themes simultaneously if you do not like movies about serial killers but are fascinated by the astonishing bureaucratic culture in the former sovjet union this movie is a mustsee anywaybr br i cant compare it to silence of the lambs for several reasons the way the serial killer is portrayed has been done far much better in citizen x you see several details of his private life because you travel along with the killer which gives you some idea of the source of his constant anger and sexual frustrationbr br the only other movie i have seen that is as realistic as this one was henry  portrait of a serial killer if you were fascinated by that movie you definitely need to take a look at citizen x
0,as interesting as a sheet of cardboard this dispensable period piece has little going for it its overly wordy and fails spectacularly to evoke the tension and fear that the reallife characters must have felt as they dodged the french revolutions fickle hand of justice eric rohmer at 82 it shows
4,brothers with psychokinetic powers yes really duel not just for debra wingers affections but really over a secret from their childhood that left them at odds over their powersbr br there are surreal touches the fire brigade that act like a singing greek chorus but there is also humour wit and romance the soundtrack is great also and similar to the way american werewolf in london used every great wolf song they could get  but with fire and i dont think ill ever forget dennis quaid mmmmm dennis quaid setting his own trailer a rockin too shes a lady  priceless br br best line missing from the quotes section btw  once youve had a clown you never go backbr br i love this movie i just ordered the dvd from the us and if the comments written by the kind of people whod be happier with legally blond dont put you off  give it a try 
7,lets hope this is the final nightmare this is the epitome of a good thing gone bad okay there is still some enjoyment to be had but only in the most mundane sense rachel talalay had been there for the duration of this franchise had been on the production staff and produced even i dont know what she was thinking but this debacle comes complete with the human video game boy and a guest appearance bybr br tom and roseanne arnold i wish i had a clue what she was thinking when she wrotedirected this disappointing piece of garbage she even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this movie was nothing more than an overglorified popcorn movie instead of bearing any resemblance to horror with the contrived use of a 3d ending arent those glasses nifty and you get to keep them its the equivalent of you just spent 900 making me rich heres 10 cents now dont you feel special sorry but for me it just did not make me feel special br br and freddys had yet another facelift this one was for the worst i think all the beautiful artistry that went into his look in the earlier films has been replaced by an obviously cheaper less detailed set of prosthetics he looks  less like the burn victim he is supposed to be and more like he has a skin disorder changing the leads makeup like that so far into a series is about on the same level as changing the lead actor but wait theyve done that and done that so i guess it doesnt matter but it mattered to me freddy is no longer scary hes just  another lowrent monster like the leprechaun br br its morea dark comedy than the horror classic this series promises riddled with what you can only hope the writers thought were witty oneliners and clever repartee sadly it fell short on both accounts br br so theres nothing more to say than grab the popcorn and get ready to laugh because there was not one scary or suspenseful moment in this entire film br br it rates a 3210 frombr br the fiend 
0,i work at a movie store and as such i am always on the lookout for an excellent movie i decided to check out nothing as it sat in our canadian section and ive been trying to support my countrys movie industry i was in for a surprise the film features david hewlett and andrew miller in a highly entertaining story that seems to delve into so much of our minds and relationshipswithout working that hard it is consistently comedic through the interaction of the two characters as well as some funny exchanges we cant be dead we have cable what more can i say without noting that it is worth a shot even if you abandon it within the first half an hour
4,well what to saybr br having seen the film i still have to wonder what the hell the point of it all really was vdodgy camera moves in the courtyard at one point i had to look away from the screen i was feeling physically sick round and round and round you get the ideabr br very very strange accents at many points those that should know knowbr br unless your getting in for free or being paid to watch it or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something then forget it
4,i will start by saying that this has undeservedly be panned by just about everyone the fact is it wasnt what anyone was expecting especially from guy ritchie what everyone was expecting was cockney geezers and good one liners do ya like dags etc but this is far more mature than his previous works i would agree that it is confusing but all the facts are there for us we just have to see them and listen harder this film demands all your attention look past the cool and dazzling look of the film try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performances and i think we will all get a more thorough understanding of the whole filmbr br yes this has its influences from modern classics fight club pulp fiction etc  but it is in the whole original in both direction and pacing with a music score second to none i feel that if everyone watched this film over and over they would understand it a lot more and maybe appreciate it for the fine piece of modern cinema that it is and i hope also that ritchie continues in this vain as i far prefer this to his mockney masterpieces
2,this independent film was one of the best films at the tall grass film festival that i have ever seen there i loved it there are so many things that was great about the film on top of all that the cast and crew that i had the opportunity to meet were absolutely phenomenali thought that avi did a great job in his role and ricky ullman was absolutely true to his role for a disney actor i was amazed at his talent to be able to go from cheesy teen comedy to such an adult role with no problems the talent in the film was just amazing the cinematography was just great if you want to see an independent film this is one really that you should seei think that mr gruver would have been so proud to have such a submission in his festival and his parents loved the movie so much when it won the audience favorite they went and saw it again this truly was a great film it was dark and funny and sad and truly emotional it was just fabulous i am honestly just so enthused by this film and i really dont want to spoil it for any one just see it and truly be amazed at it i think that these film makers really have what it takes to go places and i hope to see more work from them in the future
7,this a good episode of the new twilight zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories i note both of them are based on short stories examination day is set in the future year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves huge tvlooking phones that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain ageand the examination day a point where 12yearolds must undergo a governmentrequired iq test the kid is this story dickie jordan david mendenhall is just celebrating his own 12th birthday and is a smart kid so is calm even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades his parents christopher allport and elizabeth norment on the other hand say he shouldnt have used his birthday wish on getting a good score and while their reason includes that they believe hes capable and he should have no need to worry its pretty obvious they are worried i wont give anything away in the ending but i will say this  theres a point where we get a glimpse of whats to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject that evening or another his parents ask dickie whether hed prefer to watch tv all night by todays standards wed be pleased hed say hed rather read and not just because theres nothing worth watchingbut why would his family ask this the flavor of whats encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from harrison bergenon which i hear hasnt received a great adaptation to the screen i only wish they couldve provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as the obsolete man was i found it to be better than the short story it was based on i havent read the one that a message from charity was based on but would like to since it was interesting  a 16yearld boy peter robert duncan mcneill is suffering a fever from unclean water that has always been common in his massachusetts hometownbut he is able to see through the eyes of a young puritan woman suffering the same type of fever charity payne kerry noonann who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him they both recover especially since its common for that to happen in 1985 but the connection doesnt go away charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of 1985 and they each enjoy each others company especially peter who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students even at the college hes been staying in one place at things take an unexpected turn though when charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the 13 colonies will breach from england as a sign of bewitchment added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever not so common in 1700 the two try to learn a way to save her the ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times through a lessonwarning that sounds like something rod sterling wouldve cooked up and entertainment make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship love and wisdom do a great deal probably 34 of this has no theme but somehow i think it all would have been approved by sterlings crew
0,i was bored around 10pm so i watched this movie and i could not stop laughing everything was so ridiculous the way the kids were acting like they were older than 11 just cracked me up one of the kids had a ring that supposedly killed people after or so years it gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangsterbr br its pretty hard to take little kids seriously especially when it has to do with eating worms they act like everything is such a big deal like if billy the main character doesnt eat the worms then the world will endbr br this is a good movie for little kids excluding the fact that a year old says penis but not for teens or adults who dont want to waste their time
3,creep is a new horror film that without a doubt will please many genre fans simply because its so down to the point and unscrupulous it has many genuine shockmoments a whole lot of repulsive goresequences and a rare claustrophobic tension what it hasnt got is logic and a solid plot but to tell you the truth that didnt bother me for one second when the endcredits start to roll there are still many unanswered questions to ponder on but directorwriter christopher smith in his debut seemly preferred to fully focus on tension and adrenalinrushing action instead of long soporific speeches and theories that could explain the existence of the creep in the london subway the story revolves on the young and haughty kate who leaves her own party in order to go and meet the famous actor george clooney whos in town to present his new film she falls asleep in the subway misses the last train and she finds herself trapped in the underground subway network things really get terrifying when she encounters a madraving lunatic who lives in the old tunnels and killskidnaps people to experiment upon even experienced homeless people security guards or sewerworkers cant rescue her from this ravenous monster i really dug the creepcharacter hes nauseating hideous and primitive but in a strange way fascinating christopher smith only leaves us clues and hints and its merely up to the viewer to guess this vile creatures origin and background i reckon this isnt very original and im sure many people wont appreciate the lack of content but i forgive smith and i think its better this way than going over the top completely jeepers creepersstyle that particular film started out great as well but as soon as the creepers identity was clear it turned into a very mediocre horror effort the obvious aspecttolove is the outrageous gore theres some severe butchering going on in this film and the makeup as well as the sound effects are very convincing the ominous setting of the abandoned london subway during night is effectively used there also is some actingtalent present in this film with franka potenta run lola run returning to graphic horror nearly five years after the cool german film anatomie creep is terrific entertainment when youre in an undemanding mood and christopher smith definitely is a director ill keep an eye on make sure you dont have to take the subway right after watching this film
2,in august 1980 the disappearance of baby azaria chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents lindy and michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation the media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood what followed was a gross miscarriage of justicebr br michael and lindy chamberlain claimed that while camping near ayers rock central australia that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area noone believed them lindy was charged with the murder of her baby and michael as an accessory after the fact the whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing the chamberlains trial was over before it beganbr br lindy never proved her innocence so she was found guilty there was never enough evidence to convict her yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure how could we as a nation even sit in judgement from where we are how could we possibly presume to know unless there was absolute proof and no reasonable doubt whatsoever the chamberlains should have been acquittedbr br fred schepisis film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of john brysons novel that the chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them that in fact a dingo did take baby azaria on that fateful night at ayers rockbr br schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation hell bent on the truth being brought to light he shows australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the chamberlains pay his screenplay cowritten with robert caswell vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurredbr br the outstanding meryl streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts she brings to life most convincingly the tough little aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight even her accent is almost but not quite spot on a very good effort by the master of that trade sam neill is every bit as good as streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart and he starts to question his christianity his as was streeps is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly the entire support cast are also excellent with some of australias finest actors and actresses playing a partbr br technically the film is brilliant too with director of photography ian baker capturing this great land with splendour especially the rock editor jill bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged while bruce smeaton provides a telling scorebr br for all aussies this is a must see a shocking look in the mirror if you will at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served and the truth to be known as michael chamberlain said  i dont think anybody really understands what innocence meansto innocent peoplebr br saturday may 20 1995  videobr br even on return viewings fred schepisis account of the travesty of justice that befell the chamberlains who lost baby azaria at ayres rock in 1980 is still emotionally powerful and honestly movingbr br schepisi and robert caswell have expertly transferred john brysons novel to the screen telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for michael and lindy chamberlain whose new born daughter azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put downbr br amid media speculation and vicious public rumour lindy was charged with the murder of her baby and michael was charged as an accessory after the fact what followed was little more than trial by media and with the australian people determined she be put away lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidencebr br meryl streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles australia head on to prove her innocence she is truly awesome and the only thing that fails her is a true blue aussie accent though she does her level best to sound ocker you might wonder why a top australian actress wasnt cast in the role but star power is probably the answer alongside meryl is an equally impressive sam neill outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes while he feels powerless to do anything about it a strong aussie cast lend compelling supportbr br editing from jill bilcock is very timely ian bakers cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant and bruce smeatons music is perfect for the part truly a must for all conscientious australiansbr br sunday june 15 1996  video

6,i just saw adam had four sons for the first time and the thing that struck me was that i believe that the model used was theodore roosevelt and his four sons they were approximately the same ages as the four boys in this film warner baxter in his portrayal of adam stoddard talked about the same values and family tradition that you would have heard from our 26th president without some of the more boisterous aspects of trs character br br like tr all of the stoddard sons serve in world war i in this case though the youngest only loses an eye instead of being killed br br but what if a female minx gets into this all male household and disrupts things thats susan haywards job here in one of her earliest prominent roles hayward is a flirtatious amoral girl who marries one son has an affair with another and starts making a play for the third its an early forerunner of the kind of a part that later brought her an oscar in i want to livebr br i suppose that with as powerful a model of decorum as theodore roosevelt was and warner baxter portrays everyone is afraid to tell father whats going on the sons and also their governess ingrid bergman heres where the plot gets a little silly bergman is introduced to us as a governess hired by baxter and wife fay wray for their kids wray dies and baxter suffers some financial reversals in business bergman has to be let go she goes back to france and years later comes back to the family when the kids are grown up br br im sorry but i cant believe the kids need a governess now hayward is quite right when she confronts her that it wasnt the kids who brought her back in the normal course of things bergman would have gotten on with her life br br one of the previous reviewers said that a quarter to a third of the film i have was edited out possibly that could be the reason for the many plot holes we havebr br its too bad that ingrid and susan could not have done another film together in the fifties when hayward was at her heights and bergman had just made a comebackbr br susan hayward is the main reason to see adam had four sons and im willing to believe that a good deal of ingrid was left on the cutting room floor
1,midnight cowboy is not for everybody its raw painful and realistic but very entertaining the lead actors jon voight and dustin hoffman who would go on to become oscar winning actors deliver amazing performances voight as the texas hustler joe buck who migrates from small town texas to new york city to become a hustler he does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy the new york city women like the rich lady played by georgeann johnson and cass played by oscar nominated sylvia miles are different than texas women sadly buck is trying to escape from his past life in texas he was raised by his grandmother sally buck played by the wonderful actress ruth white who died in 1969 from cancer the locations in new york city are wonderful to watch as is the relationship between fatso played by hoffman and bucks characters evolve into a moving male to male friendship the men are struggling to survive the new york city life by not playing by the rules like getting a real job as the film evolves bucks past comes to the surface and its haunting but not clear the film is not for children but compared to todays films and television programming midnight cowboy might be more tame i cant forget a young brenda vaccaro and a party that you cant forget its also a tearjerker of a film so get your hankies out too
6,macarthur is a great movie with a great story about a great mangeneral douglas macarthur this is of course the story of one of americas great military figures and a figure made familiar to me from the earliest moments of my memory though there is a continuity issue there may be others eg macarthurs speech portrayed in the film as his 1962 address to the us military academy on accepting the thayer award did not contain the phrase old soldiers never die they just fade away that was in his speech to congress upon his dismissal by president truman in 1951 for his alleged insubordination these two did not see eye to eye gregory peck is impeckable as the general who vowed he would return to the philippines in world war ii the film moves quickly and easily with the general his family and his staff from the beginning of the second world war to the end of his service career this film would be of much greater significance to one familiar with both ww ii and the korean war nevertheless pecks portrayal of this great man who fought the twin evils of fascism and communism and who hated war as only a soldier can is a memorable one indeed in war there is no substitute for victory
5,how can a movie with amy posey and raechel have nothing funny in it believe it or not house bunny did this better and funnier hopefully the principals had a good holiday and got some money  this movie is an embarrassment to all of them it is a clich from beginning to end clichs can work well with a script or at least an idea this movie does nothing but use clich after clich rather than ideas or script it uses the preexisting personas of the actresses rather than develop characters bad sad and rubbish now i apparently have to have ten lines of text for a comment really why as an it ops manager this is another example of sloppy coding
7,i bought dark angel seasons  two weeks ago after catching a couple of season episodes on channel nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is i havent enjoyed anything as much since firefly also and amazing show ill admit season wqasnt quite as good but there are still some amazing episodes see designate this bag em the berrisford agenda harbor lights freak nation etc and alec is great ive heard some of the plans for the wouldbe season and i have to say i cant believe it was cancelled  i wont spoil it for you  but it would have rocked i also think it has a lot of potential as a movie although at the moment it seems highly unlikely as proof of my obsessiveness maxs barcode number is 332960073452 and in the two weeks ive had it i am episodes away from having watched both seasons twice its just too good
1,this time the hero from the first film has become human and this time uses fist and foot combos against super universal soldiers and a computer which has gone awry and is prepared to take over the world im pretty sure it was double team which convinced everyone that jeanclaude van damme was no longer credible in providing watchable action flicks however it was this that tarnished his credibility forever while universal soldierthe return isnt as dull as double team or the questits still pretty awful indeed with none of the style and flair of the original and no star pairing this sequel is made simply for kids who enjoy professional wrestling as i look back not even the action sequences were all that exciting and therefore this movie is a worthless dud in other words another clunker in van dammes assembly linebr br  out of 4bad
6,the only film ive ever walked out on amazing since i paid for myself and my date and im really cheap but my brain couldnt stand any more of the dreck being piled on particularly since i could have written funnier material while tie up and gaggedbr br from the beginning to the end this film offends worse it aint funny it wasnt funny then and it sure aint funny now but even worse is that this film represents the beginning of the end of really smart sophisticated comedy its juvenile really sophomoric script and ideas began an era which continues to this day where cheap laughs and sexual innuendo dominate the culture of comedy in filmbr br sexual olympics what high school kid hasnt thought of that the beginning of the end
0,this movie is terrible the suspense is spent waiting for a point there isnt much of onebr br aside from a few great lines  i found a tooth in my apartment  and the main characters dedication to killing himself its a collection of supposedly eerie soundsbr br 
6,although this was not without its faults this drama was a fitting one to be shown around easter time it reminded us of our spiritual selves and showed that behind our facades we often hide our deepest sufferings and experiences there was so much to enjoy in the drama not least the rapping teenagers who provided a better musical accompaniment to the drama than the rather poor sound score in the background the acting was excellent and timothy spall was once again superb the climax was very satisfying if rather simplistic timothy spalls letting go of his longdead wifes suicide was credible and mirrored well the feelings of despair that were present in the teenage girl who selfharmed the resolution between the graffiti boy and the muslim was gratifying but less believable a wonderful drama which left myself and my husband felling that the evening had been well spent congratulations
6,this is is a thoroughly unpleasant if slickly made movie i tried it because it stars richard dreyfus and jeff goldblum two good actors and because the plot line  a mob boss is about to be released from a mental institution  sounded promising the movie is billed as a comedy sorta what we have is an endless series of shots  you should pardon the pun  of people in dimly lit and elegant if somewhat surreal interiors shooting each other  in the head stomach kneecap foot heart no part of the anatomy is avoided it seems while uttering vague and cryptic dialogue some of which is supposed evidently to be humorous in a sort of postmodern way goldblums dialogue for the whole movie could fit on a 3x5 card and he wears a single facial expression  a sardonic grin  throughout ellen barkin and gregory hines do the best they can burt reynolds does a cameo the credits list rob reiner and joey bishop but i somehow missed them good move on their part the whole thing is cold sterile mechanical and unsavory an heir i suspect to the style of pulp fiction fargo and natural born killers if you liked those youll probably like this
0,oh its the movie  i thought i waited too long to take out the dog i cant believe i watched the whole thing i guess i was optimistically anticipating that it was going to get better horribly disjointed dialog pathetic acting and totally improbable events like tobys mom hanging herself in the time it takes col to walk upstairs and back down in a room with a 24 ceiling and no chairs counters or anything around her motionlessly suspended body that she could have possibly used to climb on to do herself in the little girl that played the daughter of the last family was the best actor in the whole movie and the puppy of the first couple was a close second the basic storyline has potential and with a good script and director could be a seriously creepy flick but this version sadly is not it i get more scared when i open my electric bill every month
6,this is one of the few movies i watched twice in the theatre i really love this movie for its atmosphere and its telling of the life of tragic hero esteban trueba he makes so many mistakes but gets a chance for redemption isnt this a rather consoling thoughtbr br when i watched it for the first time i thought that after the won election the movie would be over  i didnt know the book so boy was i wrong when the dramatic climax was still to come i was literally swept away by the sheer power of the last half hour of the filmbr br many people here utterly dislike this movie i cannot understand that one single bit maybe those who read the book first are  as often with screen adaptations of novels  simply disappointed that so many things have remained untold unseen unexplained but as a movie telling a touching story  the story of a family the rise and fall of a man the deep compassion of a woman the strength of love and the insanity of hate and conservatism  this movie is simply splendid furthermore the soundtrack is incredibly good and the cast is wonderful as well  especially winona ryder and jeremy ironsbr br so definitely one of those films that cinema was invented for
4,a lot of people seemed to have liked the film so i feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review but after sitting through 96 minutes of it i feel i have to do so where the heck is the plot in this film i must have missed it i was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened sure the ending was somewhat shocking but they didnt build up to it i forgot who was who half of the time so they didnt really develop the characters the acting was soso most of the time it was believable but i was able to see through it most of the time so without giving anything away i must say that unless you like the actors in the film there is no real reason to watch this movie i could be mistaken but i just didnt understand why there was so little or too much of the film i cant decide which one that would be so i say judge for yourselves i dont even know if renting it would be a good idea the cost and all br br plot 010 characters 110 acting 210 overall 310 i feel like thats too high really i am staying with my vote up at the top
3,humphrey bogart clearly did not want to be in this film and be forced to play a partmexican or he would have been suspended believe me  he made the wrong choice presumably after the success of dodge city warners tried a followup with errol flynn and his usual list of buddies like alan hale guinn big boy williams frank mc hugh and the everpresent john litel but they made the huge mistake of trying to present miriam hopkins as a love interest for flynn v randolph scott and as a singer to really make things bad because she proved one thing and that is she cannot sing the story was not too bad but with bogie clearly miscast also it turned out to be a poor western that was overlong and on a low budget but in fairness color would not have helped
2,a good picture is worth all the words this film has the most poetic scene ever dreamed of about people with downs syndrome and i wont spoil it by telling you youll want to see it yourselfbr br pasqual duquenne is an amazing actor i did not need to understand a single word he said to understand his meaningbr br the film has a magic of its own after watching it i understood better that we put too much value on achievement and not enough on the people we love passion and simplicity is all we need
5,repugnant bronson thriller unfortunately its technically good and i gave it 410 but its so utterly vile that it would be inconceivable to call it entertainment far more disturbing than a typical slasher film
0,i am not one of those who think king is a great writer his books are fine distractions for a few hours and often have interesting premises however they in my opinion fall apart pretty rapidly if you give them any serious thoughtbr br this film suffers from being a pretty exact retelling of kings story if you have read the book there are zero surprises no changes no altering of scenes or characters this is a film made by king fans for king fansbr br for the rest of us there is nothing terrible about the film it is a gypsy curse horror with its twist being the curse being something many people wish for to become thinner the final third has some severe structural problems and the slightly forced ending seems to break the rules of this genre a littlebr br there are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life but you might as well read the book because there is nothing new herebr br 
3,i couldnt agree more with nomad 7s and i a hvrs comments a perfect laid back sunday morning movie the humor is subtle exact opposite of slapstick as one misguided commenter notedbr br but what always ceases to amaze me is how often i find myself wanting to come back to this movie over and over i originally copied this movie onto vhs about 12 years ago when it was premiered on one of those pay cable free weekend previewshbo maybe had never heard of it previously dont know why it wasnt marketed that well  when dvds were released en mass it was one of the first movies i replaced a great combination of cast and writing plus the back drop of montana wilderness doesnt hurt things either beautifulbr br its probably not the type of comedy for everyone but what is if adam sandler type stuff is up your alley this probably wont be your cup of tea this movie needs your full attention the humor is mostly in the dialogbr br i believe my next viewing will probably be about my 12th but i still know that when it gets to the scenes like the one where the hoods of the police cars start blowing off im going to loose it ed oneills face is priceless recommended 110
4,i have to say the first i watched this film was about years ago and i actually enjoyed it then i bought the dvd recently and upon a second viewing i wondered why i liked it the acting was awful and as usual we have the stereotypical clansmen in their fake costumes the acting was awful at best tim roth did an ok job as did liam neeson but ive no idea what jessica lange was thinkingbr br the plot line was good but the execution was just poor im tired of seeing scotland portrayed like this in the films braveheart was even worse though which is this films only saving grace but seriously people didnt speak like that in those days why do all the actors have to have glaswegian accents just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes i notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the americans and to be honest i can see why theyd like it i know they have an infatuation for men in kilts however if you are thinking of buying the dvd id say spend your money on something else like a better film
0,how can a major german tv station broadcast a mess like this its amazing how the main actors avoid every acting talent  even the wellknown gottfried john is acting very poor  especially in the double murder scene  how amateurish the screen plan is very  very extended  perhaps to fill out parts of the movie be careful not to fall asleep while watching the set is obviously very often a blue screen fg the scenes on the ship with unreal sea in background in the german version the sound and the dubbing is very poor  probably reason different languages of actors  but other international productions do handle this much more professional advice do not watch  its a diabolic waste of time
6,robert wuhl is teaching a class of film students at new york university in manhattan new yorkbr br he covers fallacies of history and truths that are no longer generally known i would like to see much more of this show it is very entertaining mr wuhl uses examples and show and tell to get his points across he explained that the person who actually rode the midnight ride of paul revere was not paul revere henry wadsworth longfellow used reveres name because it sounded betterbr br ive watched robert wuhl for many years from the time he was doing standup comedy and all the way through arli on hbo hes a good actor and a good standup comedian but hes an excellent teacher i highly recommend that you watch an episode of this show it is well worth your time

5,this movie should be required viewing for all librarians or wouldbe librarians all of the best lines are directly related to librarianship the public library vs academic library argument is a classic argument waged among librarians and library school students it also breaks many librarian stereotypes librarians might even be capable of having fun  even if they dont usually have sex in the romance languages section the best movie about librarians desk set with katherine hepburn and spencer tracy of course
6,such is the dilemmaabove that debbie must face at the close of this sam sherman production naughty stewardesses debbie has just hit town become a stewardess slept with an elderly rich manwho she describes is in his 50s but obviously hit that mark a decade or two ago shoots nude scenes for a photographer she just met and then is the central element to a kidnappingextortion plot through it all and amidst all that emotional upheaval and soulsearching what in heavens name will debbie do well i cannot give it away completely but dont expect any real epiphany here lets face it naughty stewardesses is just what it wants to beat least twothirds through a soft core porn film with lots of topless women and a funny in that kitchy 70s way film there is no grand art here the movie was designed to make money and exploit a growing trend at the time to put nymphomaniacal stewardesses in films so that the audience could live out vicariously their voyeuristic tastes by todays standards the film is pretty tame what this film does do wrong is try to be some kind of statement film at the end cmon anyone here believing that little diatribe by debbie while on the beach contemplating life she would spend more time picking out which halter top she will wear that day then do that and what about the ridiculous plot to steal 50 grand it didnt make sense to me so how on earth did these characters dig it anyone buying cal as a member of the plosomething like that or even as a director for hardcore pornography he would be luck to get work at seven eleven this is as another reviewer noted more of a sam sherman piece then and al adamson piece you can tell when al is in complete charge there is virtually no budget and the film doesnt look nearly as polished as this adamson does a decent job directing this time and i have to give sherman credit to a degree while this film is bad just for what it was meant to be it has a certain style to it i liked the opening credits with the animation and photographs i even liked the music of sparrow silver heels was a somewhat catchy tune the movie doesnt look cheap really at all compare that to any of als horror films as for the cast yes bob livingston is a bit old for the lead but some examination went into his character and the obvious thread that young women are attracted to men with money was explored as well i had major problems with robert smedley who was just plain awful in his role the girls have all got great sets so what else was required of them huh naughty stewardesses is relatively harmless exploitation film from the 70s and will serve as a living time capsule for certain aspects of life during that decade by the way did i mention it is a pretty bad picture
5,br br burning paradise is a combination of neoshaw brothers action and ringo lams urban cynicism when one watches the film they might feel the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that doesnt matter its attitude and atmosphere that counts this great film has both always trying to be different than his contemporaries lam gives us to traditional heroesfong saiyuk and hung shikwanand puts them in a raiders of the lost ark setting however these are not the lighthearted comedic incarnations that you might see in a jet li movie instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results what makes the film even better is that anyone could die at anytime there is no holding back too bad they dont make films like this more often
2,once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they somehow managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended youll find that its not half bad the plot is engaging and interesting and the pacing is fast with this covering many situations and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken where this really stands out is the acting the performances are excellent neill and streep are both impeccable its also cool to hear so much australian spoken in a hollywood film and even those who dont come naturally to it at least attempt an accent the cinematography and editing are nice enough but they dont really go beyond the standard stuff this movies story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling while i have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture i understand that it is quite close to the truth there is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this it is at times a downright great courtroom drama i recommend this to any fellow fan of such 710
1,lol not a bad way to start it i thought this was original but then i discovered it was a clone of the 1976 remake of king kong i never saw king kong until i was 15 i saw this film when i was the films funky disco music will get stuck in your head not to mention the films theme song by the yetians this is the worst creature effects ive ever seen at the same time this film remains a holy grail of bmovies memorable quotes take a tranquilizer and go to bed put the yeti in your tank and you have yeti power i remember seeing this film on movie macrabe hosted by elvira there is one scene where it was like king kong in reverse in king kong he grabs the girl and climbs up the building but in this film he climbs down the building and grabs the girl who was falling also around that year was another kong clone mighty peking man 1977 which came from hong kong there is a lot of traveling matte scenes and motorized body parts this film will leave you laughing it is like i said just another king kong clone rated pg for violence language thematic elements and some scary scenes
1,this show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel it is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera its tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest  then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera stylebr br it also borrows from an early cbs game show pioneer beat the clock by inventing situations for its contestants to try  overcome then it rewards the winner money if they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters even better while the game format is in slow motion versus beat the clock the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality br br this show has elements of several types of successful past programs reality television hardly but if your hooked on the contestants locale or contest this is your cup of tea if your not this entire series is as i say drivel dripping with gravy it is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in 2000br br it is slick  well produced so it might last a while yet after all so do reruns of gilligans island green acres the beverly hillbillies  the brady bunch this just doesnt employ professional actors the intelligence level is about the same
0,the order starts in rome where the head of a special order of priests who deal in ghosts  demons named brother dominic francesco carnelutti is found dead cut to new york city where one of his order alex bernier heath ledger is contacted by topbrass cardinal driscoll peter weller who asks him to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding dominics death along with his girlfriend mara willims shannyn sossamon  fellow priest thomas garrett mark addy alex travels to italy to delve into his mentors death as the truth begins to emerge it appears that dominic was a sin eater someone who absorbed others sins  lived with the burden of them so they could die peacefully  that the church wasnt happy about his activities alex must do whats right even if it goes against what he believesbr br also know under the title the sin eater this american german coproduction was written produced  directed by bian helgeland  didnt really do that much for me if im honest  i usually am honest that is anyway lets start with the mess of a script that has some ok ideas but its throughly predictable excruciatingly dull  boring really silly at times  it takes itself far too seriously the whole concept is daft  while it thinks its clever with its oh so neat twist ending that ties everything up  brings the story full circle i thought it was the most obvious  lazy way to end things theres the usual religious themes here morality sin forgiveness faith belief prophecys blah blah blah you know the sort of thing then theres the twists which arent hard to see coming theres the abuse of power by high ranking clergymen corruption greed evil etc you know the sort of clichd hollywood ideals  themes that get reused every time it deals with the church the order has nothing new to say  as a serious piece of filmmaking it sucks a lot im not too sure who the order is meant to appeal to as a diehard horror fan i didnt see much horror in this at all as a thriller its less than thrilling as a mystery its too predictable  theres nothing here to really grip or maintain ones interest  for some reason i cannot figure out the imdb also lists the order as an action film which is absurd as its as exciting  actionpacked as the average episode of sesame street 1969  present harsh maybe but its what i thinkbr br director helgeland does an ok job the film seems to have a very soft lighting scheme  it all looks a bit drab grayish  dull for a supposed horror film the order is very light on scares or horror elements in fact there arent any of either apart from two evil kids who can turn into a flock of birds for no apparent reason dont ask forget about any gore or violence as there isnt any which is fine but it would have helped at least make the order somewhat watchable according the imdbs trivia section the release date of the order was put back so some of the special effects could be improved because they looked unintentionally funny all i can say is judging by the finished film the effects must have been really bad to start with because they arent exactly brilliant as it stands nowbr br i was amazed to see the order had a budget of about 28000000 which is a hell of a lot of money  i just cant see where it all went apart from the sets  production design which are good the whole film looks  feels very average  utterly forgettable the acting is ok although the annoying fat guy who seems to be some sort of foulmouthed comic relief irritates a good actor such as peter weller deserves better than thisbr br the order i prefer the title the sin eater actually not that it matters too much misses all of its intended targets by the proverbial mile as far as im concerned  is a pretty dull way to waste 100 odd minutes of your life so dont do it not recommended

2,a brilliant movie about family guilt sacrifice betrayal and love macy is such a great actor it was almost a shame to see him in the same scenes with campbell who looks the part of a neurotic sex object but doesnt have the chops to work with him on the level the script called for but hes such a good actor that he played down to her level to make the scenes work i highly applaud the casting of tracey ullman as the neglected wife who knew sutherland is also very good the way he moves makes his character look taller and even younger in some scenes almost everyone knew what they were doingbr br macys portrayal of the only situation in which his character is not able to be careful is nothing short of complete mastery

0,i rented this some years ago the video store had only vhs at the time straight to video was hitting its strides you know where the box covers use the same font and color schemes of successful filmsi didnt know what to expect other than what was printed first thing i thought while watching was what the hells wrong with the soundobviously there was no dialogue dubbing words echoed so i stopped munching on whatever i had to pay closer attentionmind you theres no shakespeare herejust simple talk the story is simple enough boy meets girl etc what struck me as humorous and heartfelt was the people in the movie didnt seem like caricatures written into the storybut rather nonactors plucked temporarily from their real jobsuniforms included all the while you begin to sense what the filmmaker is afterthen see that there are no attempts at cheap humorpeople hurting their privatesusing vulgarities this couldnt have hurt the marketing there was something honest about it i thought if theyd have a bigger budget then it would have been better which im sure they considered dailybut they went ahead and made it this i felt was what independent filmmaking is all aboutthe word indy is thrown around as if its a genrehathats funny
5,my name is julia ross is a mesmerizing 1945 b thriller from joseph h lewis arguably one of the very finest directors of hollywood noir films this 65 minute gothic oddity from columbia pictures came after lewis lengthy apprenticeship as the helmer of a string of poverty row westerns east side kids comedies horror melodramas including the incredibly bizarre bela lugosi shocker the invisible ghost and standard studio b product secrets of a coed bombs over burma the falcon in san francisco etcall of which set the stage rather nicely for what was to come from the enormously talented and inventive mr lewis my name is julia ross as well as so dark the night from the following year introduced a director who had mastered the rare and delicate art telling a dark and probing tale swiftly and efficiently on the most modest of budgets later lewis productions like gun crazy 1949 and the big combo 1955 despite the expanded scope of their narrative structure continued to rely upon deft lucid camera work and effective lowkey lighting and very modest resourcesbr br my name is julia ross probably owes more to the tradition of british mysteries its set in a studiobound england than it does to conventional film noir attitudes and trappings a young woman nina foch agrees to take a position in the home of an elderly woman dame mae witty two days after her arrival she awakens from a deep sleep in a completely strange house and mysteriously enough with a brand new identitythat of the old womans daughterinlaw told that shes been the victim of a nervous breakdown she struggles to grasp the utter and seemingly hopeless nature of her predicament but before long she begins to piece together the strange and troubling truth behind this dark mystery that her husband the always menacing george macready most probably murdered his real wife and that shes been duped into participating in a harrowing and sinister scheme much of what distinguishes this otherwise modest tale are the indelible touches that lewis brings to the production marking it as the first of his truly serious endeavors as a film director
1, slight spoilers br br way back before evangelion was made before hideaki anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans and before gainax had reached the status of fanfavorite gunbuster was made with only wings of honneamise made by gainax at that time and the famous otakon shorts or course gunbuster had some tough acts to follow up it didnt make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before space operabr br luckily gainax decided to put it out as a sixpart oav direct to video series this allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film this also prevents it from becoming too boring and overly long with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way besides that they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in macross or gundam and many other popular space operasbr br for one the shows starts out pretty light with noriko in the okinawa high school for mechapiloting noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle when she was still a little kid this makes her life at the academy quite hard as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that noriko is favored by the professors the first episode is pretty much a comedy drama with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced and noriko and kazumi best girl in class are chosen to help the assembled fleet outbr br the middle bulk of gunbuster leaves our female lead in space focusing on both personal drama and action a couple more characters are introduced and parts of norikos past are dragged up again besides that the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute and the gunbuster mankinds final hope is presented smart as writer okada was he incorporated the principles of time dilation to spice things up a bit in short time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light this means that noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete also the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated when noriko sees her friends again on her return to base who have aged considerably more than her the science might not be perfect but its presented in a pretty believable way with even some sd science theatre shorts in between the episodes where noriko kazumi and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the seriesbr br the animation for a series made in the 80s is definitely good the designs are retro 80s style of course but it has its charm animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice although the costumes do betraybr br some of the fanservice fascination gainax will later exploit to the fullest the mechas throughout the shows are pretty cool too with the gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine strong and vast the last episode was entirely done in black and white while its generally believed but not confirmed that this was done for budget reasons it lends a whole different atmosphere to the series which is suited perfectly for the latter partbr br the music is very typical space opera fair too bombastic in places very generic and definitely not worth buying it does fit the series for the most part but it can become quite annoying at times tanaka is not really a famous composer and the only other respectable series hes worked on is dragon half if you think 80s anime music you will know what to expectbr br as the series progresses the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle but in such a way the viewer will hardly notice this step by step the drama will be toned down and the battles will take the front row neither aspect is ever left completely out though with the last episode in sight noriko and crew are fighting for the further existence of human kind and with the last battle in sight certain questions are presented to the audience concerning to position of the human race in the galaxy and how far it can go to guarantee selfpreservation while they are never answered later on they still present some interesting food for thought the last episode is very epic with a nice but quite predictable ending though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course again it fits the seriesbr br gunbuster may sound like your average space opera anime at first with alien invasions huge battles and some personal drama and for the bigger part it is but it is done exceptionally well for a change instead of going for a steady mix of former elements six episodes long gunbuster presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale epic heroism along the way we meet with some various interesting and well fleshedout characters which mutual relationships changing heavily due to the time dilation phenomenon the show is very tightly written although it does tend to slip up at some points overly dramatic occurrences and too cheesy mecha attacks could have been easily avoided overall the trip gunbuster takes you on is a very relaxed sometimes sad sometimes heroic one it might not have shattered the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre but at least it bend them a little highly enjoyable anime classic but not without flawsbr br 
4,british comedies tend to fall into one of two main types the quiet introspective usually romantic study and the farcical social satire settings characters and concepts vary but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories butterflies is perhaps the epitom of the first type br br the scripts are very verbal including long interior monologues by the main character ria a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life when she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman who makes his interest in her quite clear she toys with the idea of finding out what the other path might have offeredbr br the acting and scripts are always on the money which makes ones reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one i was neither blown away by it nor turned off my mother on the other hand adored this show i think the degree to which one identifies with rias dilemma is the most important factor in determining ones reaction to butterflies
1,now for all of the cinematographical buffs out there this film may not rank high on your list of things to see but if you know anything about plot development profound truth and the intentions that this film the series had youd understand my povbr br granted the specifics of the film are renderings of the writer who cannot be expected to know what will happen in the end but the film is biblically accurate and justifiably scares viewers into thinking about what may be im a christian not due to this movie but due to my personal decision to accept jesus as my savior the film and potential that something similar to the circumstances portrayed therein can remarkably scare someone into thinking about their actions and decisions its not some cheap attempt to scare people into believing in god but rather a means to get your attentionbr br as a christian i know ill not be left behind and thanks to movies like this i can look beyond the superficialities of entertainment acting and film budgeting to appreciate the depth that the film has to offer this is a movie you shouldnt not only see but feel with your heart and soul
0,the only good part about this film is the beautiful scenery this movie was long and boring the minister should have retired from the pulpit the time his son paul strayed from the teachings he proclaimed how many times can his boys take the lords name in vain in this film being from a presbyterian background it doesnt fit i wished paul was swept down the river without a boat at the very beginning to spare us the silly smirkish selfish story of paul brad pitt so norm becomes a teacher and paul becomes a compulsive gambler who norm wants to rescue but doesntso what its very uninteresting we see the prejudiced whites being stood up to by paul because of his native american girl that was the only part that had some interest and maybe could have been developed into a real wild western what we only see is a sleepy town where the two ministers sons have nothing to do but norm chase a lame girlfriend and deal with her family and 2paul make up dumb stories at the newspaper shop while scratching his head and take a lot of swigs and tie a lot of flies id rather watch a show about fishing that that film againwhich will be never
1,a splendid example of how hollywood could and still can take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly foul it upbr br in the case of the big sky writer dudley nichols and company arrogantly assumed they could improve upon a classic pioneer novel by the pulitzer prizewinning author ab guthrie in so doing they removed the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have had as a film adaptationbr br the epic nature of guthries book and the evolution of its main character boone caudill from a naive kentucky lad into a hardened and competent survivormountain man has been replaced with a downscaled riverboat farce that bears little resemblance to the authors intent in the movie version boones presence is nothing except underwhelmingbr br intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give guthries novel impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason whatsoever most puzzling of all is the emphasis placed upon the zeb calloway character who was an incidental minor character in the book only occupying a handful of pages on the other hand a very important and fascinating character dick summers the veteran pioneer is missing altogether it is also apparent that director hawks decided the zeb character in the movie played by actor hunnicutt wasnt irritating enough so zebhunnicutt was given a significant amount of time doing that obnoxious voiceover narration that is the hollywood short cut for incompetent screen writing editing and directionbr br some movies have actually improved upon the books upon which they were based william wylers benhur is an excellent example but this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film unto itselfbr br the story is dull and clichd and the characters  at least the ones that have not been edited out of the script  are just shallow and boring shadows of guthries literary vision and unfortunately kirk douglas star appeal which could have helped lift this film was scuttled by the milktoast role he was givenbr br if you can believe it the film version of guthries pulitzer prizewinning sequel the way west also starring kirk is even worsebr br in my opinion the big sky further solidifies howard hawks place as one of the most overrated tepid directors in the history of cinema

1,at least i was able to enjoy mocking the movie which is surprising since i was barely able to sit through it in all honesty my guess is the cover to the dvd case cost more than the entire movie and saying that it is the same director as the boogeyman when a new version of that just came outnice touch guys it was misleading enough to rope me in the only thing that frustrated me more than the insufferable acting of the copycat was his haircut usually you only see that kind of hair on a ten year old boy and the character acted like it the film looks like it was shot by a d grad student of some film school excited to use every film technique he ever learned while attending classessometimes less is more buddy through out i would get lost by random plot twists that led nowhere or were unexplained all this makes a bad movie but when the ending doesnt even come close to pulling it together well that makes it an exceptionally bad movie without a doubt this is the worst movie i have ever seen and that includes my friends french final video for senior year of high school but hey maybe im a bit biased i mean i did get to play an extra ps i dont even think this deserves a starnot even a half none for you
6,a good deal of running around a badly conceived adversary with very little complexity a scientist who works in communications sending off signals into space and receiving them gets caught up with aliens along with his pretty wife he invades their territory and is given secrets about them he becomes rather traitorous in the process granted he is given little choice anyway there is a scene where he gives them everything they want this is a dull movie with lots of long stretches where little happens the plot isnt technically bad its just that we are usually following a car a trip through a woods investigating a building this is what editing is all about i suppose the story wouldnt technically support much more not much here
6,nina foch insists that my name is julia ross in this 1945 film noir also starring dame may witty and george macready its short and because it is the film suffers it could have stood to have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour longerbr br when i was growing up foch was a fixture on television playing a neurotic woman the wife with the cheating husband the nervous wreck she became one of the great acting teachers in los angeles here shes a pretty young ingenue playing the title role julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by mrs hughes and her son ralph little does she know  though we learn immediately  that the employment agent is a front set up to get just the right woman for this assignment a woman with no family and no boyfriendbr br its a livein situation once julia gets to the house shes drugged and when she wakes up shes told shes mrs hughes and not allowed to leavebr br the acting is very good low budget but still entertaining  some things particularly at the end happen way too quickly which is why i said the movie is too short nevertheless i recommend it
1,okay okay maybe not the greatest i mean the exorcist and psycho and a few others are hard to pass up but the shining is way up there it is however by far the best stephen king story that has been made into a movie its better than the stand better than pet sematary if not quite as scary better than cujo better than the green mile better the dolores claiborne better than stand by me just barely though and yes its better than the shawshank redemption shut up its better i dont care what the imdb top 250 says br br i read that a couple of decades ago stanley kubrick was sorting through novels at his home trying to find one that might make a good movie and from the other room his wife would hear a pounding noise every half hour or so as he threw books against the wall in frustration finally she didnt hear any noise for almost two hours and when she went to check and see if he had died in his chair or something i tell this with all due respect of course she found him concentrating on a book that he had in his hand and the book was the shining and thank god too because he went on to convert that book into one of the best horror films everbr br stephen king can be thanked for the complexity of the story about a man who takes his wife and son up to a remote hotel to oversee it during the extremely isolated winter as he works on his writing jack nicholson can be thanked for his deadon performance as jack torrance how many movies has jack been in where he plays a character named jack as well as his flawless delivery of several nowfamous lines heeeeeeres johnny shelley duvall can be thanked for giving a performance that allows the audience to relate to jacks desires to kill her stanley kubrick can be thanked for giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch and whoever the casting director was can be thanked for scrounging up the creepiest twins on the planet to play the part of the murdered girlsbr br one of the most significant aspects of this movie necessary for the story as a whole to have its most significant effect is the isolation and its presents flawlessly the film starts off with a lengthy scene following jack as he drives up to the old hotel for his interview for the job of the caretaker for the winter this is soon followed by the same thing following jack and his family as they drive up the windy mountain road to the hotel this time the scene is intermixed with shots of jack wendy and danny talking in the car in which kubrick managed to sneak in a quick suggestion about the evils of tv as wendy voices her concern about talking about cannibalism in front of danny who says that its okay because hes already seen it on tv see its okay he saw it on the televisionbr br the hotel itself is the perfect setting for a story like this to take place and its bloody past is made much more frightening by the huge echoing rooms and the long hallways these rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize the emptiness of the hotel but it is the hallways that really created most of the scariness of this movie and kubricks traditional tracking shots give the hallways a creepy threedimensional feel early in the film there is a famous tracking shot that follows danny in a large circle as he rides around the halls on his big wheel is that what those are called and his relative speed as well as the clunking made by the wheels as he goes back and forth from the hardwood floors to the throw rugs gives the feeling of not knowing what is around the corner and being a stephen king story you expect something to jump out at you i think that the best scene in the halls as well as one of the scariest in the film is when danny is playing on the floor and a ball rolls slowly up to him he looks up and sees the long empty hallway and because the ball is something of a childs toy you expect that it must have been those horrendously creepy twins that rolled it to him anyway you get the point the shining is a damn scary moviebr br besides having the rare quality of being a horror film that doesnt suck the shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed had jack always been there like mr grady told him in the mens room was he really at that ball in 1921 or is that just someone who looks exactly like him if he has always been the caretaker as mr grady also said does that mean that it was him that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters and not mr grady after all its one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied thats just mediocre filmmaking for example the amityville horror which obviously copied much of the shining as far as its subject matter did this but it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think as mostly all of kubricks movies are one more thing that we can all thank stanley kubrick for and we should thank him for is for not throwing this book against the wall that one toss would have been cinematic tragedy
4,i never heard of the book nor care to read it but the movie i will probably see many timesbr br this film is unforgettable with perhaps the richest imagery i have ever seen in a movie it was as if i was looking at paintings many times which i think was the ideabr br terrific movie story actors and cinematography full of profound emotions from every angle although i am not particularly fond of romance movies i loved this and was deeply moved by winona ryders plea to her father toward the endbr br mr irons deserved an award for his performance and close was never betterbr br 
1,i never saw this when i was a kid so this was seen with fresh eyes i had never heard of it and rented it for my year old daughter plus the idea of christopher walken singing and dancing made me curious the special fx are cheesy and the singing and dancing is mediocre but the story is great my daughter was entranced i loved watching walken in this role thinking about what the future held for him very amusing to see him dance and if the songs werent great at least they werent disney overproduced saccharine sweetness the ogre scene in the beginning was a little scary for her and she was a little nervous when we saw him again at the end but it was mostly benign interestingly we had recently read puss in boots and i had wondered about the implausibility of the story but while staying true to almost every aspect walkens acting made it believable great fun id watch it again with my daughter
1,there are other reviews here so i dont need to say how great it is or what its aboutmy point is i heard about this movie ages ago before it was shown i cant even remember how i just know it was through the internet the distributors went under before it ever hit for months i moped and complained please note that on this page theres a link to buy this film and the only highlighted area is vhs at amazoncom in germany you can use alta vistas babelfish to translate i know its pal format and they did change the text on the screen to german and theres a tiny little bit of narration at the beginning thats also been dubbed in german but as hilarious and campy as this film is it really only makes it funnier if you want to see this movie and you have a place nearby that does conversions its so worth it it cost about twenty dollars or so to get to the us from germany trust me it might seem like a lot to spend on a film but if youre into corny bflicks youll be blowing money left and right getting conversions for your friends
3,jeremy northams characterization of the stuttering mild mannered bookish morgan sullivan and watching him let loose bits and pieces of his real identity under the influence of single malt scotches and under the spell of lucy lius presence is brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch his offering her a cigarette at the bar is an old habit done without thinking or even asking and he becomes lost in her face neck and lips no matter the brainwashing love has a way of persevering love also cannot be brainwashed in with either of his two fake wives in gradual stages he begins to dispense with his glasses to walk and talk differently and even his face looks different as the movie progresses the music is fantastic hypnotic sexy and appropriately driving at times the extensive use of black and white and grey tones makes this almost a sci fi film noir in the tradition of many classic thrillers i would have liked to have seen more vulnerability in lucy lius portrayal whenever she sees him in his various frazzled states the man she loves and for whom she is performing a mission based on blind faith some restrained vulnerability and flashes of genuine sympathy and concern would have made it a less one dimensional performance on her part she is just no match for northams talents but all in all i thoroughly enjoyed this film and would enjoying knowing about other screenplays written by the same author
5,at first i was convinced that this was a madefortv movie that wasnt worthy of primetime but after a few minutes of dumbstruck awe i realized that there was at least comic value in the overthetop stunts and cmovie acting this movie would have gotten a if my wife and i hadnt laughed so hard as we watched it in wonder that the actors could keep a straight face it was like a lessfunny spy version of the big hit i laughed so much i actually bought the big hit dvd with evenworse acting we were disappointed that nick chose to marry elena and not jim after all of the hugging and highfives a few rum and cokes will definitely help it go down easier
0,i have seen this movie and even though i kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning i still liked watching it i would recommend it to other people it comes on lifetime movie network quite a lot and i am thinking since its close to halloween they might play it more so please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it i believe that alicia silverstone played her part very well i really like her as an actress and person she seems so nice and down to earth kevin dillon hes performance was so so for me i am not trying to knock him or anything but i believe that his brother matt would have been able to pull this bad evil serial killer persona better kevin just seems too sweet for me but i think he did okay
7,i cannot say this movie is a disappointment because i read some reviews before watching and it did not do as well as i thought it would have the bar was not set that high so the fact that my expectations were met is not saying muchbr br the good the city of new york if you live in the city like me youll recognize certain places and understand that the city is supposed to be more than just a setting rather one of the main characters there are genuinely tender moments humorous conversations and plot twists left and right which all keep things interestingbr br the bad the first thing i thought after leaving the theater was that i wanted more but not in the positive leave them wanting more fashion certainly the good skitsscenes outweigh the bad but there are a lot of skits that fall within the inbetween category too many in fact which is what ultimately brings the movie down also new york citys diversity though hinted at though the many distant pans of the city and mentioned in conversation throughout the movie is never really realized or analyzed to the point of doing the city justice for example many of the skits involve well to do middle aged whites i mean i know the city is home to many of the said demographic but come on paris jetaimes plot and character diversity makes new york city look like lancaster pa or someplace really white it is just disappointing to see the city shortchanged on its heritage like thatbr br still even after having said this i would recommend giving new york i love you a view who knows maybe youll disagree with my opinion and maybe you wont you will never know until you see it for yourself this review is not meant to deter anyone from watching this movie as everyones opinion on art differs im just giving you a very vague heads up on what to expect
0,this is one of the worst films ever i like cheesy movies but this is simply awful where are the images in the film that are on the box i think more money was spent on the dvd box illustrations than on the entire film br br why would a company release a dvd that the cover is so misleading i feel like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box as much as i explore imdb i should have done a little research and made a list prior to visiting my local video rental store i have no one to blame except myself i want my money and time back br br do not watch this movie br br even if curiosity is motivating you stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead it will be much more enjoyable you have been warned
7,salva and his pal bigardo have been at the margin of the law during most of their lives we see them panhandling in a car of the underground where their pitch to get donations is so lame no one gives them anything salva who is a hardened petty criminal doesnt even have any redeeming qualities that is until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of what to do next religion and show business prove to be a winning combination something that salva capitalizes onbr br he and bigardo have been in jail after the accidental death of a priest that was critical of the duo salva shows he is a natural for the reality show he transforms himself into a christlike figure who is an instant success in the program espe who is a nononsense woman who is shows producer cant escape from the way salva pays her unusual attention ultimately salva is the victim of his own success in the endbr br jordi molla whose first directorial job this movie is had some success in the way the film satirizes the role of television spain which was vulnerable to these types of programs has seen its share of the bizarre which is what the director felt is an assault on the viewing public and wanted to set his story from the point of view of the people that are making a fortune out of the naive audiencebr br the ensemble cast has some good moments in the film mr molla like any actor who decides to direct his first feature would have been more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera candela pena a good actress is one of the best reasons for watching the movie juan carlos villedo david gimenez cacho franco francescoantonio florinda chico and the rest responded well to the new director
5,and laugh out loud funny in many scenesbr br the movies basic plot is well chronicled a story of opposites trying to find a way to survive each other in close proximitybr br this is unquestionably lemmon and matheaus best film as costars and the interaction between the sloppy oscar and the ocd felix are classicbr br the scene where oscar lines up a double date leaves the room briefly and comes back to find felix and the two girls all crying is pricelessly funnybr br for any fan of intelligent comedies the odd couple is a go out of your way to see it film
7,so thinner yep this steven bachman read steven king yarn about a man who gets his just desserts from a gypsy elder who he just killed the story itself is there no doubt about it but i dont know why i didnt enjoy it more than i could have i guess what really distracted me was the actors i mean whos the lead robert john burke whos he and fer crying out loud can someone please stop hiring joseph mantegna for every italian mafioso role there ever is and while were at it does every mafioso have to have a pasta cooking italian mother the only good acting job done here is under 10 pounds of makeup michael constantine as the gypsy elder hes pretty good but the rest i make you all better actors
1,yay i think its hard to say its hard to have an emotion about a movie that has no emotion this movie is as sterile as a surgeons scalpel for a setting it has a few stone pillars some stone seats a couple stone crosses and some stone actors they have no emotion the only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it is hamlet and hamlet is a terrificly written piece of literature the dubbing really wasnt all that bad though the voices stuck true to the dull gloomy dreary lifesucking atmosphere the movie gave forth i have seen this version of hamlet on the fabulous mystery science theater 3000 three times and each of the three times i was on the brink of turning off the tv despite it being mst 3kbr br not an uplifting production of a drama that deserves so much better
1,a bum gives a secret serviceman a tip about a secret service man in the presidential detail who plans to kill the president baloney how did the bum know the script then turns to a most detailed examination of how the secret service works but who cares most of this just slows down the movie all the chases that follow are this films version of the tiresome car chases of many movies then after a lot of impossible athleticism in which our hero outruns and outguns all his buddies we have a shootout in the toronto city hall the canadians are clearly marked with maple leafs but how did they get into this finally all is worked out but it still makes no sense
2,witchy hildegard knef traps a group of people in an isolated hotel and picks them off one by one in twisted disgusting ways i thought id seen it all until one unfortunate man here is crucified and then has his head set on fire hildy is quite the prankster too she takes a nagging harpy and sews her mouth shutthen hangs her upside down in the chimney just in time for a roaring fire witchery made me sick it made my eyes hurt i was ready to write it off as the worst movie evereverever made by otherwise competent peopleuntil the finale i have to admit i loved the ending it involves a boy and his toy taperecorder cornered by linda blair looking fantastically possessed the scene only lasts for about a minute and the movies over but you know that old saying if youve got a great ending people will forgive you for just about anything
6,many of the reviews and comments i have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by clara bow although the storyline was rather typical of claras later silents i still find it somewhat heartstirring and incredibly fun clara plays a happygolucky hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she lovesnever mind that this man is married claras lack of modesty was shocking in the day but i believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie though definitely not a brilliant storyline quite typical actually this movie is a nice showcase of claras ability to make the audience laugh
1,this is one of the worst movies i have seen this year you should not see this movie but if you insist on wasting your time you should stop here there are spoilers gray matters centers on gray and sam baldwin heather graham and tom cavanagh only gray and sam are brother and sister living together in everyone elses eyes as man and wife no sex but just about everything else early on the movie starts with its theme the most absurd thing at the most absurd moment with you guessed it the most absurd reactions gray and sam decided to check out the dog park with a borrowed pooch rather then push her brother to get the skinny on first woman they see for him she does it and gets to the nittygritty questions too when she signals her brother to come over they start a 3way date charlie bridget moynahan is the girl of their dreams like all the right things etc sam final hits gray over the head and the couple finishes the date with a marriage proposal that charlie accepts in one week charlie gray and sam are to be in vegas in the next week charlie and gray are off shopping for wedding gowns apparently charlie has an offtherack figure gray is slurping an iced latte when charlie suggests gray tries on some gowns as well and picks out a 10000 frock for her while charlie is zipping her in this downpaymentonahouse gown gray continues to slurp on the latte i swear it was like a feed bag what should happen but woops latte all over the gown it is never explained how they got out of bloomingdales bridal salon with out a 10000 mocha colored gown back to reality  caesars palace las vegas they have the high roller room sam is a resident surgeon and charlie is an intern zoologist  were do they get all this money gray kicks sam out to the single room down the hall so she and charlie can have a bachelorette drinkathon were you guessed it  they kiss gray remembers everything charlie remembers nada they make it to wedding chapel and right when the reverend gets to his line if there is anybody is here who has any objection whatsoever to the union of these two lovebirds gray gets the hiccups gray excuses herself for some reason the reverend must repeat his last line and right on queue again hiccups gray gets back to ny and starts dating any man she meets literally and of course one is you guessed it again gay the other is a jerk and the third is a taxi cab driver alan cummings named gordy he is smittened with gray but the feelings are not returned they become great friends this is good because when she comes clean with sam about the kiss he blows up and kicks her out of their apartment when sam comes to his senses he goes to her office gray works at an ad agency this office is smack in the middle of the twilight zone it has cameras and microphones in all the conference rooms that broadcast to all computer monitors at the agency sam gets gray in one of the conference rooms for a notsoprivate conversation and ends up outing her to the entire office this is where i doubt that there was a gay man or lesbian on the crew gordy comes to her rescue and convinces her to go to a lesbian bar sorry no men says the bouncer so gray and gordy return with gordy in drag bad drag he was in a sleeveless black satinlike blouse a string of pearls and a grandmas church hat no lesbian would ever confuse this man in a dress as a drag queen much less a woman the bar was also the straight mans fantasy of what a lesbian bar is full of victorias secret models everything turns out peachy  she goes home with her firms client gray happens to be on the womans account and finally does more then kiss for some reason no one tells charlie anything and she is oblivious through the whole movie of this kiss with gray but that is for the sequel
7,despite the high ratings given to this film by imdb users this is nothing more than your typical girlwithabadchildhoodobsessivelystalksmarriedman film the attractive justine priestlys brief nude scenes may attract voyeurs but the film is hackneyed tripebr br  12 out of 
6,ever since i can remember and im only 18 my mother and i have been and continue to watch older movies because well i find them much more rewarding in the long run but hey dont get me wrong i do love the movies we have today just not as much as i love movies of the 40s and 50s anyways now i have to say the moment i started watching the movie my eyes were glued to the tv of course my favorite character was the grandmother played by lucile watson but i loved the way betty davis and her family was portrayed the childrendid not act like children in the slightest but there is good reason for that having had to hid and run most of your life seeing the awful things children saw those days destroyed their innocence so people saying oooo i hated how the kids actedblah blah blah read between the lines and know they saw things children should not seebr br paul lukasdear paul did an amazing job now i know many people are mad that he go the oscar and bogie didnt but hey they both did amazing jobs so i think it could have gone either way but lukas performance was so amazing that by the end of the movie i was reduced to tears i loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone d
7,i dont know what the previous reviewer was watching but i guess thats what reviews are personal taste missed in this movie was the depth a very deep film many layers of emotion affecting undercurrents of withheld love because of submission to societal beliefs taboos of the times and classes race relations not being in a very good state of equality guilt yearning hate confusion very dark emotionally i thought under the skin you have to submit to the aire of it a flowing movie not slow as stated before release yourself to the flow of the film the emotions will show themselves characters reveal their flaws their nasty insides excellent and actually very cruel
1,went to see this movie hoping to see some flashes of the jet li we were amazed by in lethal weapon unfortunately too many of his fight stunts are so clearly fake that it took even that enjoyment out of it the flying kicks would be a lot more impressive if you couldnt see the wires holding him up as he flies through the air for seconds and kicksbr br too cartoonish and very disappointing
7,hollow man is one of the better horror films of the past decade the subplot is original and the main plot is even better the special effects are brilliant and possibly the best i have ever seen in a horror film kevin bacon proves again that he can handle any role that comes his waybr br claude rains shocked the world with the invisible man in 1933 well now kevin bacon has shocked us with hollow man one of the most thrilling horror films ever the action is intense and the chills are true you may actually find yourself jumping if you are watching it in the dark on a stormy night the supporting cast includes elizabeth shue josh brolin kim dickens joey slotnick greg grunberg and mary randle all of whom do an exceptional job br br spoilersbr br dr sebastian caine kevin bacon and his team have discovered the secret to making someone invisible after animal testings they move on to human testing but someone has to be the subject volenteering caine is turned invisible but when his team is unable to bring back into visibility caine is driven mad by his condition as he seeks his revengeend spoilersbr br the film has created memorable shock sequences and is destined to become a classic well into the next century becoming the basis for a spoof joke in scary movie this film grabs you by the throat and never lets go the first 45 minutes or so are slow developing the characters and showing how their experiments work the second half is exciting and appealing to most action and horror fans think of deep blue sea then change the sharks into an crazy invisible man and then change the water into fire and explosions a rehashing of a killer shark movie interesting hollow man gets 55
2,the movie starts something like a less hyperkinetic more pastiche dead or alive strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered by police officers but when a police officer is killed one tatsuhito gets involved and when he discovers that his brother shihito is also involved things get bloody quite fastbr br an earlier work of miikes shinjuku triad society is still filled with his usual in the ol ultraviolence and sadistic sex acts though its not one of his more eclectic or flamboyant pieces rather its a pretty well crafted bit of pulp fiction as tatsuhito digs his way through the underground a maze that leads him to a gay triad leader who sells illegally gained body organs from taiwan and keeps an almostbrothel of young boys one in particular the character who kills the cop at the beginning tatsuhitos brother is getting involved with said society so tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate into this sordid realmbr br whats mainly interesting about this little bit of work is the relationship tatsuhito has with his nemesis wang tatsuhito is a japanese born in china later moved back into japan and alienated for it wang is a chinese who felt alienated in china so killed his father and developed a crime wing in japan wang also is a surprisingly shakespearian character which is weird enough as it is much less that you actually begin to feel sorry for him by the time his ultimate showdown with tatsuhito comes to be and tatsuhito himself is a similarly tragic figure when hes forced to contend with his lack of ability to control his brother while it would be rude to state that miikes movies are successful mostly on their shock value it is true that sometimes its easy to lose track of how well miike can create bitter disimpassioned charactersbr br polarisdib
7,having seen three other versions of the same film i am afraid for me this is by far the weakest primarily due to scotts rather dull and leaden performance his emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film alistair sim portrayed the role infinitely better when scrooge was at his meanest you dont get the sense scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing i cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the alistair sim version even the musical version and frankly the muppets take on this are better executed very disappointing
5,this was a favorite of my childhood  i can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time now that im grown up and have a kid of my own i wanted to introduce him to this classic movie we watched it last friday and he liked it during abus fight with the giant spider my sons hand crept over and took hold of mine  he was genuinely scared is he gonna beat the spider poppa just watch youll see he has no historical frame of reference to speak of eight years old so bagdad under the grandson of haroun alraschid might as well be oz under ozmabr br i think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derringdo were perpetrated by the boythief and not the grownup king in fact if you deconstruct the films narrative a bit the king is the thiefs sidekick not the hero at all  which must be very satisfying to imaginative adventurous young boys br br its definitely a period piece  i suspect that by the time hes eleven or twelve my son will find it corny or whatever word the next generation will be using by then the love story is barely onedimensional  as a cynical friend commented why does ahmad love the princess because the narrative demands it the willingness of abu to put himself in jeopardy repeatedly for the clueless lovestruck deposed king is equally improbable but to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses fiftyfoot genies and the temple of the allseeing eye would be fatuous in the extreme the satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movies climax is tremendous as is the final shot of abu triumphantly flying away on his stolen magic carpet seeking some fun and adventure at last
5,im not a john cleese completist although i thought fawlty towers was brilliant but i am a fan and when i saw this sitting neglected on a shelf at my local blockbuster i decided to give it a try what i got was a wonderful surprise and one of the funniest 50 minute viewing experiences ive ever had the writing is typical english goon show schtick in fact as an audio skit this wouldnt be out of place on a firesign theater album but the execution and timing is spot on and this elevates strange case into the kind of jawdropping performance that can create lifelong british comedy fanatics br br the brits have a gift for combining broadly satirical lampoons with closely observed tics of character and timing and the creators use both to good effect here cleeses portrayal of holmes seems to owe much to the arkins and sellers inspector clouseau however cleese has such a knack for physical comedy that he more than holds his own but the unexpected treat here is arthur lowe who plays watson as an genial but invincibly uncomprehending imbecile with such superb timing and delivery that he becomes the best aspect of the film id never heard of lowe before this his background seems to be vaudeville and musical theater but he justifies his entire career with this performance as far as im concernedbr br some people might not care for strange case especially if british whimsy isnt their cuppa tea but i am extremely glad i got to see this before it vanished from sight
5,we brought this film as a joke for a friend and could of been our worst joke to play the film is barely watchable and the acting is dire the worst child actor ever used and hasslehoff giving a substandard performance the plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on it tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughablebr br just terrible

4,i think you would have to be from the usa to get a lot of the jokes but if you liked princess bride and forest gump you would like this movie you cant compare the quality of the filming to those of course but having the cameraman trip was obviously done on purpose killer tomatoes is a hundred times better than nepolean dynamite just my opinion im sure that people from france would not appreciate the caricatures of the french so this film isnt for a world audience and while i am not a trained film critic i know what i like i couldnt stop laughing through the whole movie my sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie
6,cinderella is one of the most beloved of all disney classics and it really deserves its status based on the classic fairytale as told by charles perrault the film follows the trials and tribulations of cinderella a good girl who is mistreated by her evil stepmother and equally unlikable stepsisters when a royal ball is held and all eligible young women are invited read the king wants to get the prince to marry cinderella is left at home whilst her stepmother takes her awful daughters with her but there is a fairy godmother on handbr br the story of cinderella on its own wouldnt be able to pad out a feature so whilst generally staying true to the story otherwise the fairly incidental characters of the animals whom the fairy godmother uses to help get the title character to the ball become cinderellas true sidekicks the mice jaq and gus are the main sidekicks and their own nemesis being the stepmothers cat lucifer their antics intertwine generally with the main fairytale plot and are for the most part wonderful admittedly the film does slow down a bit between the main introduction of the characters and shortly before the stepsisters depart for the ball but after this slowdown the film really gets going again and surprisingly since cinderella is the most worn down story of all time probably ends up as one of the most involving disney storiesbr br the animation and art direction is lovely all of the legendary nine old men animated on this picture and mary blairs colour styling and concept art she also did concept art and colour styling for alice in wonderland peter pan the three caballeros and many many others manage to wiggle their way on screen the colours and designs are lovely especially in the fairy godmother and ball scenes as well as in those pretty little moments here and therebr br overall cinderella ranks as one of the best disney fairytales and comes recommended to young and all that embodies the disney philosophy that dreams really can come true

1,by 1909 dw griffith had been directing films for the biograph company for about a year and  working at a rate of two or three per week  was rapidly beginning to develop his skills as a filmmaker the sealed room is a very interesting 11 minute short a fascinating piece of gothic melodrama that even drifts slightly into the realm of early horror the simple narrative was probably inspired by edgar allen poes 1846 short story the cask of amontillado and concerns a powerful king who conceives a deliciously sadistic form of revenge to punish his wifes infidelitybr br set in medieval times the sealed room begins with the king arthur v johnson overseeing the construction of a windowless room from a sequestered dovecote the idea being that he and his wife marion leonard will have a completely private place to enjoy each others company he is obviously very much in love with her always showing his affection this latest act the crowning achievement of his endearment however unbeknownst to the king his wife has fallen in love with the royal minstrel henry b walthall during one romantic liaison inside the speciallybuilt room the wife and the minstrel are discovered and the heartbroken king conceives a means of getting his retribution on the ignorant couple silently he orders his workmen to seal off the only doorway with stone and mortar slowly descending into cackling insanity as each new stone is placed downbr br dw griffith always had an eye for acute detail and the sealed room is an excellent early example of this the lavish medieval century costumes lend the film a sense of reality and the castle interior looks authentic enough to be believable at the time the director was also pioneering methods of creating suspense and i must admit that as the film progressed i became fixated on finding out what would happen to the hapless young lovers in the early minutes griffith restricts his shots to lengthy longtakes from a stationary camera as was usual at the time but soon  parallel to the progressively darker subject matter  he alters his editing tactics in a fascinating way though he may not have invented the technique griffith was crucial in popularising the use of crosscutting  that is alternating between different events occurring at the same time not only does this create a sense of continuity but it also maximises the level of suspense since we as the audience are well aware not only of the kings ghastly actions but also that the wife and the minstrel are oblivious to it allbr br despite these innovations the sealed room suffers from many of the shortcomings typical of the era the entire film takes place in just two rooms with footage captured from a total of just three positions and so it is prone to become dull and monotonous at times the acting performances are greatly exaggerated for extra effect however at least in the case of arthur v johnson his overplaying actually contributed to recognising the escalating madness of the betrayed king a moment that i thought particularly effective was when the two lovers attempted to exit the room only to find their only doorway replaced with a wall of solid stone their panicked reactions accompanied by the silent maniacal cackling of the king serve very well to create an impending sense of claustrophobia i did think however that their supply of oxygen was exhausted surprisingly quickly
6,i saw an early screening of this film in new york and i along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience were vastly disappointed the movie wasnt even so bad it was good it was as lifeless as a snakebite victim samual l jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame it reminded me of one of those cheesy scifi movies except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy it all seemed worn flat and overtly formulaic im shocked to say i actually think anaconda was more fun its easy to understand that soap realizes its a piece of sit and plays along with it but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense its the worst kind of lame movie its joyless
4,i have seen this film many times and i like all bad teachers want to give it ten out of ten but feel that it would be unfair to other good films however i do think that this is one of those rare gems a perfect comedy it is i would venture one of the greatest comic films of all times matthau and lemmon are perfectly matched and mismatched the script is so sharp that you need to staunch the bleeding the story is well known and has already been described in other comments the two leads give extraordinary performances the girls are superb and the situations are sidesplittingly funny not one swearword in sight mark that hollywood you dont have to swear to be funny you have to be witty and the move from stage to film is seamless they dont makeem like this any more timeless
6,excellent film i cried when she cried i loved when they loved  i was frustrated when they were this film touched my heart it was a reality check for me since this is reality for me a 19 year old soldier
4,i was not entirely impressed by this film it was originally named sin eater and should have stayed that way considering that is all that was talked about for the last half of the film im not even sure what the first 20 minutes of the film had to do with any of the rest of it it was very slow and what was with picking robocop peter weller as one of the main actors that was a sad pointbr br all in all i would say check this out if you are into things dealing with the catholic religion but dont expect an exorcist or stigmata from this film it will surely flop after a few days and word gets out
0,is it just me or is that kid really annoyingbr br hideos sister spends most of her time running around after the disobedient little so and so as for him well i know hes a kid n all but his acting ability is about as wooden as a dead tree so far im only half way through and am fascinated by the story but the people in it let it down i just hope it gets better by the end as i cant not know what its all about although some supposedly cryptic messages in the scribbles on the wall and a notebook indicate everything is backwards ie dog is god live is evil etc just seems a little obvious at the moment yet nobody mentions its obvious meaning as yet anyway if my opinion changes at the end of the movie ill update this post but if your reading this then well see above statement
0,by far the worst movie of all time even yaphet kotto could not save this turkey i have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled the treasure but was changed to sharks treasure in order to take advantage of the excitement created by jaws i think sharks were in one scene of this movie the fact that they happened to be included in this thriller was supposed to sell tickets didnt work anytime something good happens in the movie the ships crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made gee do ya think that beer might have been a sponsor could they have made it any more obvious the only time anyone should break out the beer is if they make it through this thing thats cause enough for celebration
0,i did not like the idea of the female turtle at all since 1987 we knew the tmnt to be four brothers with their teacher splinter and their enemies and each one of the four brothers are named after the great artists name like leonardo  michelangleo raphel and donatello so venus here doesnt have any meaning or playing any important part and i believe that the old tmnt series was much more better than that new one which contains venus as a female turtle will not add any action to the story we like the story of the tmnt we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in every part is a good point to have some action but to have a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action we wish to see more new of tmnt series but just as the same characters we knew in 1987 without that female turtle
0,dont believe all of the negative reviews this movie receives yes it is cheaply made yes the gore is laughable and yes the acting is subpar however this is a textbook example of an early slasher flick and if that is your thing its mine then you will enjoy this one there are enough good aspects to this movie to more than compensate for the drawbacks for one the score by a then unknown christopher young is very creepy and accents the violence perfectly the ending is a welcomed break from the predictable upbeat endings of most movies and last but not least the setting is what made the film for me the makers of this film could have done a much better job dressing the set to make it more believable as a college dorm however if you can overlook this flaw the setting is great four collegiates all alone in a huge abandoned condemned building just waiting to be torn down it reaks of possibility when watching allow your imagination to do some of the work and you may enjoy this film as much as i did
4,i watched this on a weekend afternoon as there was simply nothing else on it would have been more entertaining to chew off my feet and probably less painful i urge anyone to watch this just to see how turgidly awful a movie can be surely it was deliberate i cringed at every futile attempt at humour carried out in such a childish unrehearsed badly executed way that it was beyond belief this is the movie that makes spiceworld look like goodfellas think i am exaggerating well give it airtime and think again dreadful utterly dreadful if this wasnt a prank then the director and anyone else responsible for this should be removed and promptly shot after being forced to watch this film again
0,i loved the original scary movie im a huge fan of parody it is my favorite form of humor it is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor the wayans boys seemed to grasp that concept perfectly in the original film then temporarily forgot it when making the sequel i think the wayans are a family of comical geniuses alas even geniuses make mistakesbr br the movie begins with promise i liked the exorcist parody especially the come on out ma gag now thats wayansquality material but other than that i can only think of two other times i laughed when tori spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit then becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him meanwhile hes saying it was just a booty call that was kinda funny the save the last dance parody where the cindy character inadvertently beats up a girl while practicing her new moves but even the shortlived giggles are no match for the sidesplitting laughs of the first scary moviebr br the rest of the movie is pure trash filled with cheap grossout gags jokes from the first movie which were subtle or implied are magnified and overdone for example in scary movie i several innuendos are made to imply that the character ray is gay this was hilarious but in scary movie ii the whole penisstrangulation scene with ray under the bed was mindnumbing and incredibly unfunny this is the pattern of the whole film shock humor alone doesnt take a movie very far this was a trend in 2000 and 2001 unfortunately br br as much as it pains me to rate a wayans movie so low i have to give this one a out of 10
2,tintin and i recently aired as an episode of pbss pov series its based on a taped interview of georges remi aka herge tintins creator from 1971 in which in discusses his various experiences publishing his popular character first in a catholic newspaper then in his own series of comic books awesome sweeping views of various comic pages and surreal images of herges dreams i first encountered tintin in the pages of childrens digest at my local elementary school library reading the secrets of the unicorn my mom later got a subscription to cd and i read the entire red rackhams treasure every month in 1978 i remember seeing some tintin comic books in a local book store after that but for some reason i didnt get any probably because i was 12 and i thought i was outgrowing them i do have breaking free a book written and drawn by j daniels published in 1989 six years after herges death havent read it yet this film also covers the artists personal life as when he left his first wife after his affair with a colorist in his employ whom he later married her name is fanny and she is interviewed here if you love tintin and his creator this film is definitely worth a look update 9407ive now read breaking free tintin and the captain are the only regular characters that appear here and they are tailored to the anticapitalist views of mr daniels with tintin portrayed as a rabble rouser with a chip on his shoulder who nevertheless cares for the captain who hes staying with the captain here is just trying to make ends meet with a wife and daughter that he loves dearly they and other construction workers vow to strike after a fellow employee dies from a faulty equipment accident the whole thing takes place in england with workingclass cockney accents intact not the kind of thing herge would approve of but an interesting read nonetheless oh yes dog snowy only appears in the top left corner of the cover which has tintin running over the police and the dedication page
2,i saw this movie on tv this afternoon and i cant see how anyone can sit through this piece of trash its not funny at all and it takes your iq down a few notches i know this movie is for kids but that doesnt mean the writers should take their intelligence for granted i bet that writers were sitting around a large wooden table and figured that a the word poop equals big laugh b a four foot tall kid can dunk on a ten foot tall basketball net c kids should always fight kidnappers armed with guns because the kidnappers will fall for anything and d months of karate training is all you need to beat up socalled ninjas with swords one good thing i can say about this movie is it contains the weakest suburban gang in the world that couldnt scare anybody maybe the guys at mst3k could use this movie for a good laugh dont bother with this lameass excuse for a movie
3,i get the feeling that the producers of this mess were out to make the most painful ridiculous western ever made painful is the best word i can think of to describe itbr br on the plus side you have nice color photography and beautiful and wellspoken rhonda fleming my sympathy goes to jacques aubuchon who played the cripple who acted well enough in an annoying role written so atrociously that no actor could give an enjoyable performance the production values were quite good which only served to highlight the terrible story and screenplaybr br things i hated stewart granger looked so little like a western figure what with his british accent neat tailored outfit and silly immaculate alwayswhite kerchief tied around his neck it got tiresome the way the townspeople and his son were constantly haranguing and insulting granger and he never spoke up or replied back i know we are supposed to suspend disbelief and appreciate westerns as symbolic morality plays but this one broke the spell with it laughably unrealistic and predictable scenes the worst being at the end where granger miraculously speedily and singlehandedly plants dynamite around a canyon pass that the bad guys cattle will pass through and then granger plants himself in the perfect spot so he can shoot the dynamite from a very far distance to create rock slides to bury and spook the cattle and bad guys seemingly destroying them all save the two main bad guys next worst is everything about the plot which is loaded with soap opera scenes nothing in the movie seemed believable i couldnt believe what all the conflict was about the bad guy was driving his herd through to market and wanted the cows to chew some grass along the way i dont see why something couldnt have been worked out you need a land ownership dispute for that dont bother to see it
7,heartland is a wonderful depiction of what it was really like to live on the frontier the hard work and individual strength that were needed to survive the hardships of the climate and the lack of medical care are blended with the camaraderie and the interdependence of the settlers the drama was especially meaningful because the story is based on the diaries of real people whose descendants still live there it was also nice to see the west inhabited by real people no one was glamorous or looked as if they had just spent a session with the makeup or costume department conchatta ferrell is just wonderful she is an example of the strong persevering people who came to wyoming in the early 20th century and let no hardship stand in their way of a new life in a new land
0,townies is the laziest movie i have ever seen and i saw the blair witch movies parts one and two it seems confused in what it wants to be its not funny enough for comedy its not tragic enough for drama its not bloody enough for horror and its not good enough for watching it has scenes of a man doing slapstickbloody karate so i think oh this movie will be in the vein of toxic avenger and street trash then it leaps without warning into a drama about a missing girl a retarded mentally handicap woman and a trusting mother then it slaps itself into the only good part in the movie which seems to be set up like a sitcom without the laugh tracks the part im speaking of is a lonely townie who is so lonely he finds comfort in a rotting corpse that was the only part of the movie that gave me any feeling the rest was a waist of my life then just to show how cruel wayne is there is a kind of documentary at the end of the film of wayne the director making fun of toby the star in public it made me sick even though killer nerd and bride of killer nerd two other movies by wayne arent the best they at least are thought out enough were you can stay entertained until the ending credits i even like killer nerd a bit it had some great lines i still use to this daybr br if you like underground films if you like overground films and if you like to watch your feet just resting were they are you will not like towniesbr br 12 out of br br 
7,alfred hitchcok is not my favorite director by any means but imagine what he could have done with this the plot holds much potential for suspense john garfield is as almost always excellent and raymond massey is scarily cast against type nancy coleman is not a very impressive leading lady but the supporting cast is large and very capablebr br yes it starts to sag fairly early there are too many coincidences and an important subject is trivialized by its being made into little more in the end than a love storybr br its fun to watch for garfield massey and the character performers but its not awfully good
1,even though many people here praises this movie i have to warn you it has no logic whatsoever i think that basinger does a decent job at acting but you cant make a thriller if there is a great lack of realismbr br this scene paints a good picture for you of the movie  while basinger is pursued by murderous thugs she decides to sit down and gaze upon a picture she finds from her pocket the picture is from her daughter and it reads we love you mommy who does something like that  what the eff and believe me when i say that it is not nearly as stupid as some other scenes of the movie someone stated that this is a hidden gem well i have to strongly disagree this movie has stayed hidden for a reason and its not a gem oh and please i dont even want to start commenting about the red toolbox it hurts my brain d usually the lack of logic does not bother me if it is in small amounts but this movie basically is made possible only because of the lack of logic but i still give it a because even though it is embarrassingly flawed in logic it has certain mood that kept me watching till the endbr br so if you choose to watch this you know you have been warned

0,before she went into politics or public service glenda jackson was one of britains finest film actresses this film displays her talent despite having a supporting role in a stellar cast that includes julie christie as kitty the wife of a british royal captain who has lost his memory of the last 20 years and jenny played by american annmargret in an almost unrecognizable role as the doting sister alan bates plays the captain who suffers from memory loss triggered by the shell shock during world war i sir ian holm has a smaller role as the doctor treating him you see familiar faces like sheila keith patsy byrne and frank finlay you cant help but watch glenda play a dowdy housewife and the first true love of the captain but they came from different classes its not the greatest movie but its good to see glendas amazing talent she is still a fantastic actress comedy or drama she makes margaret grey into a likable character and you see why a regal captain fell in love with her
0,when great directoractor combinations are talked about the team of j lee thompson and charles bronson is not usually mentioned probably because the output of nine joint ventures between the two of them runs the gamut from the really good action entertainment to the mediocre unfortunately kinjite forbidden subjects falls in the latter br br thats sad because kinjite could have been a whole lot better but for the life of me i dont understand why it was necessary to make the father of the missing japanese girl a guy used to getting some cheap jollies because the romance in his marriage has run out that might have been good for another film altogether but it served no purpose herebr br a straightforward cop drama with charles bronson as a vice cop whos seen a bit too much in his line of work and has a strong prejudice against orientals that part could also have used a little explaining as well but hes going to have to overcome it if he and patient partner perry lopez are going to locate a captured japanese school girlbr br bronsons time in the vice squad have told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper a stylish murderous pimp played by jaime fernandez is the guy and he and bronson have some history in fact in the films best scene bronson made him eat an expensive rolex watch and set his car on firebr br at one point fernandez happens to spot bronson and lopez in an all night delicatessen and this being after his rolex snack he sprays the place with an uzi killing everyone but bronson and lopez i really think that little incident would have had more than a couple vice cops from the lapd after fernandez but thats another terribly big hole in the plotbr br still there is a very rough justice in the end for fernandez i wish the whole film had been better though this was the last film of the bronsonthompson team and j lee thompsons last as a director he should have gone out with something better

5,ok lets get this clear im really not into scifi but for some reason i love stargate sg1 br br jack oneil takes his team sg1 through a stargate a round device that creates a wormhole it gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds it might sound like your usual scifiseries but its not the plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other scifiseries i find that great it gives you things happenings and such you can relate to and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets they have some of course but thanks to oneil who likes to keep a simple terminology theres not many br br the series has a nice blending of action humor and drama if you enjoy loads of special effects youre not going to find it here they dont use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects
3,i dont know why i keep doing this to myself i keep on defending the dutch and belgian cinema and claim that it should get more credit and chancesand then they smack you around the head with junk like this intensive care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing that was ever made in the dutchspeaking countries its a dutch attempt to create our very own horror franchise clearly based on mainstrain american slasher classics such as friday the 13th and halloween the producers and writers aimed really high with this but fell really low intensive care became an embarrassing product to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult flick here its almost impossible to hunt down an original copy of this and its only showed on special occasions like the night of distaste for exactly minutes intensive care tries to tell a story and even to create a plotlinethen it changes into a lame and lowbrain slash n stalk movie with gruesome  yet very hilarious and cheap  make up effects the acting of the entire cast is abominable even though there are a few respected names involved the leading male role is played by koen wautersthis guy might as well be the most famous and loved artist in belgium hes a beloved singer host of tvshows and idol of many young girls he never ever mentions this thing he starred in though like everybody else in the netherlands hes trying to convince himself intensive care never happened

5,when i first saw this film i thought it should have come from the childrens section  its very fun and at times humorous and is actually quite a good story but it severely lacks the romantic chemistry that actors like meg ryan and tim robbins are capable of delivering i must note that walter matthau is perfect for the part of albert einstein and his performance is extraordinary but thats the sole exception this film appears a bit forced the directing lacks substance and oh yeahthe music is ridiculously awful it didnt put me in a very good mood but if you are not expecting a smart wellcrafted comedyromance tale then this certainly can be entertaining like i saidit should be in the childrens section einstein and his buddies are a good relief from tim robbins boring almost tense quest to steal meg ryans heart a very conflicting film but as long as its not taken seriously this can be an alright movie
4,spoilers br br well the one line summary says it all melvilles le samurai is the original and there are elements of leon and they are better  much betterbr br in the samurai alain delon is a lonely warrior  professional killer who keeps a bird in cage and is stealing cars for his jobs with so much suspense in these scenes even the end is exactly the same the samurai seeks death in dignity and is getting shot with an empty gun in his hand the world has changed he realizes and there is no place for the samurai in itbr br delon is not killing so many people like the ghost dog but i guess jarmusch liked leon very much or even desperado by rodriguez so he added this too and let me guess the girl will become a professional like ghost dog like natalie portman in leonbr br so what was jarmusch thinking after all where is the unique the original thought in this moviebr br i cant see the point in making carbon celluloid copiesbr br a 410 rating by macaulay connor
7,i own this movie i bought it for 399 at a fairly major video retailer in order to do some indie type movie research since i had just finished my own feature and was editing it now when i feel down about my skills as a first time director i just sit down with a plate of cookies and severed within minutes i feel greatbr br i hate to down talk another filmmaker so ill just use constructive criticism find good actors take the time it really helps when shooting video over light your scenes and darken in the computer later on in post closeups are better for video when an actor enters a scene wait a bit beforebr br having them speak so that we know whats going on and whos talking never show the back of a door while we wait for someone to come open it damn well worth the 399br br the true horror would be getting the reviews severed has here on imdb and you have to give these guys credit they did get distributed
6,saw this a couple times on the sundance channel several years ago and received a nice cinematic jolt to the system a semisurreal yet hard edged take on modern media culture or the lack of it focusing on some seriously wacked waybeyondthehollywoodfringe dwellers it had an amusing early performance from mark ruffalo and some memorable cinematography from the dp who did the polish brothers movies there was a savage umcompromising humor and a weirdly original feel to it that definitely set it apart this film had cult classic written all over it and im surprised its not yet out on dvd br br hopefully soon
3,is nothing else on tv are you really bored well then watch phat beach however dont rent it and definitely do not buy it that would be a big mistakebr br i watched this on tv and found myself laughing at certain points i did not laugh long and i did not laugh hard however there were subtle jokes and comments i laughed at if you are looking for an extremely funny hood movie then watch friday if you are looking for a powerful emotional movie something that this movie tries atkind of watch something like hoop dreams or jasons lyric if you are lookin for some good black booty go watch a dominique simone porn flick because the nudity in this movie is nearly nonexistent however if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable go ahead and watch it you will be slightly amusedbr br out of 10
4,picture bride has an excellent look into hawaiis past and the people who lived there in that time the time money earned and the hours that these people had put into their lives to survive and live takes a whole new meaning to blood sweat and tearsbr br the concept of datingmatchmaking is something like what we do similar today via the net just that is more of snail mail very slow snail mailbr br the singing of the plantations songs from the workers reminds me of the southern plantation workers songs of their demise and future goalsbr br the movie shows the hardship as well as soft romantic scenes that hawaii can bring like the stillness of a storm coming and the sudden chaos of the rain and then the tranquility
4,i cant tell you how angry i was after seing this movie the characters are not the slightest bit interesting and the plot is nonexistant so after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other hoping that the past and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish what do we get a storm of frogs now yes i understand the references to the bible exodus and the underlying theme but first of all it was presented with absolutely no resolution and second of all it would be lost to anyone who has not read the bible a significant portion of the population or charles fort a still larger portion as a somewhat well read person i thought this movie was a self indulgent poor imitation of a seinfeld episodebr br dont waste your time it would be better spent readingbr br well anything to be honest
1,possible spoilers not surebr br while watching the lion king 12 i couldnt help but have mixed feelings about the whole film it is definitely a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes but there is nothing about it that would give you the same sort of feeling that the lion king did the story for those who havent read the other reviews is about how timon and pumbaa meet and how they affect events in the original lion kingbr br there are actually some very funny jokes in the movie my favorite part is when they show the pair raising simba however for me the worst parts have to be when they show timon and pumbaa directly interfering with the events of the original i can never look at the circle of life or can you feel the love tonight sequences the same way again im okay with the i just cant wait to be king sequencebr br the voice talents are excellent nathan lane and ernie sabella do a wonderful job as do matthew broderick the guy who does rafiki and the hyenas even the actor who does young simba sounded enough like jonathon taylor thomas for me but why did they even include a voice actor for zazu he literally had only lines and neither were very necessary the additions of julie kavner and jerry stiller only add to the talent although you still cant hear timons moms voice and not think of marge simpsonbr br there are some scenes that seem to not fit in with the original the one coming to mind being when they are pride rock at the end how did they have time to fit in the initial fight with the hyenasbr br as for the dvd itself you cant help but feel that for a disc set the special features are especially lacking they could have easily fit a commentary or another aspect ratio on the 1st disc i enjoyed the who wants to be king of the jungle game even if it is the most shameful example of cross promotion ive ever seen some of the questions are actually difficultbr br overall a good movie though not nearly as good as tlk or even tlk2
0,when i first heard about the title i thought of the simpsons just like so many other reviewers but when i saw the cast i was completely stunned that so many great characteractors would actually be in this first of all we have christopher walken deer hunter pulp fiction who plays the title character mcbain he is rescued from a vietnam powcamp by some of his buddies one of which is santos chick vennera yanks who splits a hundred dollar bill with mcbain vietnam soldiers are loaded with cash apparently and tells him that he can redo the favor to him if he ever gets into troublebr br then 18 years later santos and his sister christina maria conchita alonso the running man predator join the rebels in colombia trying to get rid of their evil dictator el presidente victor argo taxi driver king of new york and when santos fails the mission christina goes to mcbain for helpbr br mcbain then asks his good ol vietnam buddies to help him first theres the token tough black guy eastland played by american ninjas steve james who was also in director james glickenhaus previous movie the exterminator where the exterminators real name also was eastland coincidence i think not there is also a lot of other references to the exterminator among other things the most notable one being that mcbain himself wears a weldersmask when christina sees him for the first time when he is working on a weldingjob on top of a bridge br br the other guys in the vietnampack are the rich guy who can afford all sorts of equipment for the team frank bruce michael ironside total recall starship troopers and then theres the doc dalton played by jay patterson who doesnt look like the guy the imdb is linking to and i havent seen him in other movies so who knows and last but not least theres the cop gill who has had enough of his unsatisfying job hes played by thomas g waites who some of us might remember from the warriors and the thingbr br and in other big roles we find luis guzmn boogie nights carlitos way as a smalltime drugdealer who cant get a decent job also there is dick boccelli as the drugdealing kingpin who gets hung up in a crane on top of a roof by the mcbaingang almost exactly in the same way he got hung up over a meatgrinder by john eastland in the exterminatormovie now i havent seen glickenhaus shakedownblue jean cop yet but im almost ready to bet half a hundreddollar bill that boccelli gets hung up in that movie too br br well back to the plot of this movie they go off to colombia and saves the day yay but who cares about the plot anyway the cast is great and the actionscenes are very well done and youre never bored while watching this movie highly recommended to all actionlovers
5,i had to do a search on the actresses to find the board of this film because the title is now an unexpected love its not really worth looking for but i was unfamiliar with both leads and wondered why they were headlining a lesbian flick on lifetime everythings pretty restrained and you dont really get an idea of who these characters are so as a viewer i wasnt able to become emotionally invested in the storyline i guess im not the target audience for this but im not sure who is everythings muted and soft focus and earth tonesnothings very interesting i had a prurient interest in seeing two women make out but its handled so discreetly that i was disappointed rent personal best instead
6,imagine its say 121am  your at home your bored your not tired this scenario occurred about say or so years backi turned on the tv and flicked over a few channels and found that this film was on oh my word this is the worst film i have ever seen a runaway car that cant be stopped cos the brakes have been cut or something in caning it down the freeway  whats gonna happen this film was so bad its actually funny  i think the stunts cost about to make there was one instance where a babysmall child is being winched from the car by a helicopter  in an attempt to excite the viewer  a conveniently placed bridge is nearing aheadthis is the best bad bit of a film ever  it shows the child narrowly missing the bridge but it looks so bad  you can almost see the make of the dummy that they used  total low budget classic cant remember the end of the film though but i bet it was greatbr br i doubt they will ever show this film again so im glad i got to see this piece of trash
4,not much to say on this one a plot you can pretty much peg in the first 10 minutes nothing overly wrong with this film very little action for an action film there was a chance to explore the characters emotions occasionally whether an action film is the right genre to do that with im still undecided sniper was one of the easiest films to watch without giving full attention to as it had little twists and a straightforward plot i was probably guilty of that so with a second watch or with undivided attention it may be betterbr br 410 but the best of my out of 10s
7,if you need cheering up on a cold weekday evening this is the film for you excellent script and perfectly cast actors i especially loved ray psyching himself up in front of the mirror before gigs  inspired
6,this is simply the most astonishing movie you will ever see i thought it was just another documentary but it really is something else it doesnt try to teach you anything it shows you how life works in naturebr br i wont talk about the quality of the pictures because you obviously know from other comments it is unmatchedbr br earth is funny tense and sad it can make you laugh it can make you cry sometimes both at the same time this is the first movie that made me cry not because you feel sorry for the animals but because you come to realise how fragile our planet is and what treasure we were blessed with yet we dont appreciate it one bitbr br this movie should be shown obligatory in schools it is the most wonderful film you will ever see so go and see it who knows maybe it is the last time we might see our planet like thisbr br 1010 but i would easily rate it more if it were possible
4,greg davis and bryan daly take some crazed statements by a terrorists add some commentary by a bunch of uberright reactionaries ascribe the most extreme positions of the most fundamentalist moslems on the planet to everyone who calls themselves a moslem and presents this as the theology of islam maybe their next film will involve interviewing fred phelps and the congregation of the westboro baptist church adding commentary by some militant atheist scholars and call their film what the world needs to know about christianity ultimately this film suffers from both poor production values and lack of attention to the most basic standards of journalism dont waste your time and money just turn on your am radio and listen to rush limbaugh for a couple of days for free and youll get the same message with the same level of intellectual analysis
2,this movie may be the worst movie i have ever seen basically it is right above leprachaun the only difference is that it missing ice t the scene where he does the chick with the carrottpriceless oh yeah they made a second one genius
2,i rated this movie as awful after watching the trailer i thought this movie could be pretty cool guaranteed to offendeveryone the trailer said wellit did offend me because this movie really sucks it is hardly a comedy as i laughed about two seconds during the entire movie and whats with all the gays in this movie im not gay and i dont have a problem with those who are but whats the point of adding so many gayscenes in a so called comedy movie when these scenes are absolutely not funny i guess the director is a gay man in denial or something like thatbr br so my advice to you is if you want to waste good money go rent a good comedy youve already seen a million times youll be better off than watching this mother of all lousy comedys it really is total crap
1,i didnt think it would be possible for joe don baker to make a movie as bad as his stinkbomb mitchell but this one succeedsbr br i wouldnt recommend this if youre a fan of joe don bakers much better work butif you like to watch fat guys sweat and really really drawn out gun fights youll love this movie
2,how rick sloane was allowed to make five movies is harder to believe than cold fusion this film is absolutely criminal before watching this movie i thought manos hands of fate was the worse piece of crap i ever saw but at least manos moves so slowly you might fall asleep thereby rescuing your eyes from the pain it will suffer the greatest tragedy of this movie is that the old man that keeps the hobgoblins locked up makes it to the final scene the time i spent watching this movie was an absolute waste of my life
1,for this movie defines a new low in bollywood and has set the standard against which all cp must now be comparedbr br first off the beginning did have elements of styleand if handled well could have become a cult classic ala pulp fiction or a desi desperadobut the plot was there one begins to meander and at one point completely loses itbr br throw in a deranged don with an obsession for english a call center smart alec a femme fa tale who can don a bikini and a saree with the same aplomb a levitating gravity defying hitman and a cop with a hundred or was it a thousand black cat commandos on their trailgood ingredients in competent hands but this is where i would like to ask the director sir what were you smokingbr br im sure this movie would be remembered in the annals of bollywood film making  for what must never be done  insult the intelligence of the most brain dead of movie goers br br possibly the only redeeming feature in this desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is the musicwatch the videoshear the airplay and you wont be disappointed vishal shekhar come up with some eminently hummable tunes br br how i wish the director had spent the money in creating some more eye candybr br as i sign off i want to really badly know how does akshays bullet wound vanish in a microsecondwhat were you editors doing tashan maybe
7,ive been watching dick tracy for years and as a result its become a vital part of my life  it was with me throughout childhood and i used to see it quite often seeing it now as an adult its still a very good movie  dark satiric and incredibly misunderstood about the only thing that can be said is the oscar nomination pacino received  other than that it is rarely discussed and didnt make much of a fuss when it came outbr br pacino is overthetop but to good effect as hes clearly having loads of fun beatty is great as dick tracy and behind the camera manages to capture the atmosphere of a film noir comic book better than any other film possibly i have ever seen just taking a look at one scene from the film is breathtaking the lighting velvet overtones and smogsmoke combine to create a great effectbr br there are some really funny cameos including one by dustin hoffman as mumbles and i dont think there are any flaws at all in terms of acting  even the mandatory kidcharacter is far better than expectedbr br overall a really fine movie that has become misunderstood over the years since its release and is incredibly underrated with only 5710 average on imdb the critics reviews are very positive check out rottentomatoescom and after seeing the film once again its not hard to see why  this is a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic book from style to eccentricitybr br highly recommended 455 stars
5,i borrowed this movie despite its extremely low rating because i wanted to see how the crew manages to animate the presence of multiple worlds as a matter of fact they didnt  at least so its seems some cameo appearance cut rather clumsily into the movie  thats it this is what the majority of viewers think however the surprise comes at the end and unfortunately then when probably most of the viewers have already stopped this movie i was also astonished when i saw that the brazilianportuguese title of this movie means voyage into death this is the spoilerbr br that this movie is about a young girl who goes alone onto this boat on reasons that are completely unclear you understand only in the last minutes when you start the movie with the english title haunted boat in your head you clearly think that the cameo appearances of strange figures are the ghosts but in reality this movie is not like most other horror movies told from the distant writerwatcher perspective who can at almost any time differentiate between different levels of reality it is told from the perspective of the young girl we see her not alone but together with the four friends because she sees them we do not see that she is alone so the parallel worlds are not the cameo appearances flickering into the picturestream but the main story we have at least two parallel worlds the world in which the girl is and the world in which the friends are an intrusion of a third world is probably the young man with the medical skills who comes for a short time on the boatbr br i cannot get rid of the deep conviction that with this movie the moviemakers cheated an audience of several thousand people by letting them believe that what they have done is more or less a sophomore filmstudent elaborate with hastily chosen pseudoactors that have met just the night before the start of the shooting in a dump after at least twelve beers how mistaken can one be but in addition to this big surprise which one learns only in the very last minutes the end that follows gives another surprise the girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat when she has recovered from her shock she visits again the place at the harbor where she ascended the boat together with the four friends and there they are again they wave her to them from the boat which has already taken off shore she jumps into the water arrives at the boat  and they are away miraculously beautiful it remembers me a bit to the end of a poem by a rhetoromance writer when i awoke i saw death standing at my bed but i closed my eyes when i opened them again  he was gone
7,cannon pulled off a real visual beauty of a medieval epic that appears fascinating except for the dragon prop now just how did the longgone studio known for chuck norris movies ever come up with a complete lack of knowledge in the first place case in point the amateurish acting and horrible plot is a sign that reviving the medieval legend is no cure for some lousy execution they actually went on and made another cheap exploitationer featuring hundreds of lusty bimbos just to make this look even better for the two barbarian brothers they sure know how to make weird noises than becoming brave warriors so strong and bold enough to save their native land this is the single greatest waste of potential ive seen from an expensive lowbudget movie and worse enough to let an axe strike through the gorgeous print without mercy all of this followed an advertising campaign that sold tshirts based on the barbarians the movie alone makes a great souvenir
5,im a fan of both shakespeare and mst3k so i waited anxiously to see this episode ill comment on the movie first then the mst3k episode the recipe for this movie take talented actors rich and beautiful shakespeare material and a 125 budget mix well then drain of all life and movement until dull and lifeless serve cold in a big plain stone cauldron movie i give out of 10 because the actors at least deserve a little bit of credit okay now the mst3k episode ill admit it the first time i saw it i fell asleep halfway through i understand that was the reaction of several other veiwers as well however when i watched it a second time i realized that there was a whole host of intelligent references and good lines i missed the first time around the trick with this episode is listen carefully it takes a couple of viewings to catch each line give it a second chance and youll see what i mean mst3k episode 12 out of 10
2,this movie is incrediblewith great charactersspecially the old swordsman that can fly in the shape of fireball and jump across the treesthis film tells a classic story of battle between good and forces of evilthe final showdown is specially breathtaking and the music score is kinda coolbr br veryvery recommendablenot for the smallest children thoughthis one deserves a 10
7,basically caprica is the cylon origin story the premise of the show is interesting however the writers follow so many story lines and clog it with too many pov characters that it bogs down the storytelling the plot creeps at glacial speeds dissipating what tension it might have had in any given episode little or nothing happensbr br daniel graystone eric stolz is a military contractor working on a robotic soldier using a stolen chip unfortunately his only working prototype is driven by the ai version of his dead daughter zoe who died in a suicide bombing caused by soldiers of the one sto an underground monotheist extremist groupbr br meanwhile joseph adama father of battlestar galacticas commander adama is struggling to hold his family together while searching for the ai version of his daughter who also died in the bombing in a machiavellian virtual version of caprica which strongly resembles 1930s chicago br br in addition to the vapid writing caprica suffers from a similar problem as many origin stories we already know how it ends ie the cylons develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity
5,i cannot stay indifferent to lars van triers films i consider breaking the waves nothing less than a masterpiece i loved dancer in the night i admired the idea in dogville but the overall exercise looked to me too dry and too theatrical less cinema europa which i see only now was a famous film at its time succeeded in the us the relative success of an european film and got the oscar for the best foreign language movie but did not survive well the time in my opinion it is also a too much explicit and extrovert exercise in cinema art to my tastebr br the story has a level of ambiguity that cannot escape the viewer treating the period that immediately followed the second world war not in the black and white colors of victors and vanquished of executioners and victims but as rather ambiguous times when people of both sides were fighting for survival in the aftermath of a catastrophic event that change the lives of nations and individuals forever is still a source of disputes even today more such was novel and courageous two decades ago yet it is the means of expression that really do not appear fit to the taskbr br the film seems to include a lot of quotes descending directly from the films of hitchcock especially his early films set in the prewar europe with brave british spies fighting evil german spies on trains crossing at high speed the continent at dark the trains were a symbol of the world and its conflicts with all their intensity and dramatism here the train also becomes the symbol of the first sparkles of the rebirth of germany after war of its might of its obsession with order and regulation of punctuality and civility the characters that populate the train are far from being the classical spy stories good or bad guys the principal character a young american of german origin coming to postwar europe willing to be part of a process of help and reconciliation finds himself in an ambiguous world of destruction and corruption with liberators looking more like oppressive occupiers with the vanquished not resigned to their fate but rather willing to continue on the path of selfdestruction with love doubtfully mixed with treasonbr br it is yet this classical film treatment that betrays the director in this case the actions of the characters especially of leopold kessler played by jeanmarc barr seem confused and lack credibility the overall cinematography seems to be not hitchcocklike but rather from a bad imitation of hitchcock in the late 30s the usage of color over the blackandwhite film used in the majority of the time in moments of emotional intensity is also too demonstrative it is not that van trier does not master his artistic means but he is too demonstrative he seems to try too hard to show what a great filmmaker he is he really is great as he will show in some of his later films but it will be left to the viewers to decide this alone
7,as a child i preferred the first care bear movie since this one seemed so dark i always sat down and watched the first one as i got older i learned to prefer this one what i do think is that this film is too dark for infants but as you get older you learn to treasure it since you understand it more it doesnt seem as dark as it was back when you were a childbr br this movie in my opinion is better than the first one everything is so much deeper it may contradict the first movie but you must ignore the first movie to watch this one the cubs are just too adorable i rewind that flying my colors scene i tend to annoy everyone by singing itbr br the sound track is great a big hand to carol and dean parks i love every song in this movie i have downloaded them all and is all i am listening to im listening to our beginning also known as recalling at the moment i have always preferred this sound track to the first one although i just totally love carol kings song in the first movie carealotbr br i think the animation is great the animation in both movies are fantastic i was surprised when i sat down and watched it about 10 years later and saw that the animation for the time was excellent it was really surprisingbr br there is not a lot of back up from other people to say that this movie is great but it is i do not think it is weirdstrange i think it is a wonderful moviebr br basically this movie is about how the care bears came about and to defeat the demon dark heart the end is surprising and again beats any pokemon movie with the care bears moral issues it leaves an effect on you again this movie can teach everyone at all ages about morality
5,i have been learning about the zodiac for four years now and im not saying i know much more than anyone elsein fact out of most of the people who know and read and learn about z i am prolly the one with the least knowledgebut i do know or at least i think i know that most of the stuff in this wouldnt happenfrom how he signed his nameto how he killed peoplei thought that godfather was the worst film everbr br the cinematography was that of a five year oldnot saying that my films are any better but i am not someone who is making movies for the mass populationbr br the acting i thought for the most part was pretty good really i didthe lead didnt talk that much on camera or at all i forget and dont know because i stopped watchinghis voice overs where goodbr br but really spend the four dollars and 70 cents on something elselike a large pizza or somethingbr br until i learn how to write a review psycho phil
0,frustrating to watch because of one mans stubbornness to leave his native country for the dream land in switzerland and what he does to achieve that creates heartache for all those involved along the journey he encounters scumbags who take advantage of other human suffering and desperation
0,nothing positive to say meandering nonsense huffing and puffing with a message new russian postsoviet films can be very good cuckoo comes to mind yet many have the bouquet of cardboard and the aftertaste of asbestos nochnoi dozor would be a good example this is a dozor type of emptiness acting would be horrible if not for the saving grace of utterly unappealing direction and incompetent editing that sometimes is so awful that it distracts from the impotence of the actors special award to the cameraman for making sure that every shot is shaky would someone please realize that blair witch has had its 15 seconds of undeserved fame and takes are geared towards attentiondeficit preteens who subside on counterstrike and masturbation the female lead poses and tries to look seductive too often male antihero need a diction coach although genetics arent bad rather expressive eyes one middle finger for this irrelevant pile of nonart anyone who reviews this positively better be a distant cousin of the auteurs
1,im actually watching this film as i write this    if the following comments prove my lack of development as a true artistic film maker then so be it   br br but    i thought am still thinking as im presently viewing that this film    to put it mildly is very very overrated again verybr br it looks like a really really bad student film done by a someone with beyond extremely limited resources    and who didnt pay that much attention to detailbr br i dont want to go on and on regarding all the different ways that i find this film lacking but    well    i just dont get it rememeber i fully admit that maybe its me thats the idiot here  not the film maker  for not getting this piece of imaginative genius    i rented this on a whim because the reviews were very very outstanding   br br sheesh   
6,whoever wrote the script for this movie does not deserve to work in hollywood at all not even live there and those actors need to find another job the most dreadful hour and some minutes of my life and i only kept watching to see if it would get better which unfortunately for me it did notbr br even at the end the credits gave me anxiety i guess there werent a lot of people behind the movie so they had to roll the credits slowly very slowlybr br this movie is definitely a great how not to make a movie guide too bad i cant give a
2,this is one of the best episode from the second season of moh i think mick garris has a problem with women he killem all they are often the victims screwfly solution prolife valerie on the stairs i dont remember the argentos episode in season etc obviously imprint i think he enjoys to watch women been burn torture mutilated and i dont know never least right to die is one of the best with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense specially with the photos from the cell scene wonderful the acting is like the entire series regular i could be worst like prolife or we scream for ice cream also i think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode the ideology of the series is horrible killing and terminating women mutilating animals and on and on the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like cigarrette burns the best of all homecoming the most funny imprint really shocking
2,the original movie the odd couple has some wonderful comic oneliners the entire world it seems knows the story of neurotic neatfreak felix ungar and funny obnoxious slob oscar madison this paring of mismatched roommates created one of the most successful tv series of all time as well as countless not anywhere near as good imitationsbr br the odd couple movie has some wonderful jokes about oscars apartment and his sloppy habits he says who wants food one of his poker player buddies asks what do ya got oscar says i got brown sandwiches and green sandwiches whats the brown its either very new cheese or very old meat i also love the line about oscars refrigerator its been out of order for two weeks i saw milk standing in there that wasnt even in a bottle there is no question that walter matthaus oscar madison is a joy to watch on screen hes almost as good as jack klugmans version in the tv seriesbr br the problem with the movie is jack lemmons felix ungar jack makes a very very honest effort at the role the problem is that he makes felix so depressing and downtrodden that he becomes more annoying than comical tony randalls performance in the series brought the kind of humor warmth and sensitivity to felixs character which lemmons portrayal lacks tonys felix unger obviously could be annoying some of the time however in the tv series it related to specific situations where the annoyance was needed in the storyline jacks felix ungar note the different spelling in the movie seems to never be happy fun or interesting the movie felix ungar is a roommate that drives you up the wall all the timebr br the movie still has great moments that withstand the test of time the famous meatloaf fight is one of the greatest scenes ever one of the other great examples of felixs little notes on oscars pillow will be remembered forever however there are some darker sides where oscar goes over the top his crying near the end after bawling out felix and a scene involving felixs linguine dinner although lightened by a funny line seem more depressing than comicalbr br perhaps there wasnt enough time to see the lighter side of these characters that made the series so memorable in the movie the beginning 20 minutes are very boring the same issue occurs with felixs conversation with the pidgeon sisters the movies ending is predictable and too pat theres very little care or compassion for each of them by the other the result is that the darker side of the film leads to a lot of depression and anger rather than comedy unless you are watching the great scenes described above it appears that jack lemmons monotone persona of felix brings the film down rather than enhances or embraces the comedy between the charactersbr br it really took the 1970s tv series to make the odd couple the best that it could be the original film is still very good however the tv series is much better
7,lately they have been trying to hock this film latenight on cable tv commercials dont believe the hype i was one of the unlucky people to see this stinker in theatres this is in my opinion the 3rd worst movie of all time just behind mac  me worst and jack frost worst but i must admit they are all close and all terrible really nothing of this movie is funny or disturbing or anything else it claims to be so dont waste your money the only thing it is good for is giving to your worst enemy im not lying about that someone who you would love to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this film it is that awful if you dont believe me then you deserve to suffer through the misery of watching this which i doubt you can finish two thumbs enthusiastically down
0,i havent seen henry fool but after watching fay grim im not sure i want to maybe hartley aims to be the antithriller directorhe sure succeeded with this yawner based on the official descriptionwoman discovers that her dead husbands manuscript contains material that could pose a threat to national securityi expected a taut geopolitical drama instead i got flimsy structure goofy dialog flabby characterizations a convoluted plot and a tone that shifts so often it suggests that hartley changed the script according to his mood at any given time i can hang for a long time with a frustrating hardtofollow plot eg duplicity because i figure that the loose ends eventually will come together even when they dont or they do but they leave lingering questions eg duplicity sharp writing and acting can hold ones interest but halfway through fay grim i reached a deadly realizationi didnt know what was going on and i didnt care too bad because i really like parker posey reduced here to working with an absurd part that asked her to morph from indifferent estranged wife and indifferent clueless mother to tough shrewd international player capable of psychological mano a mano with terrorists theres also bad casting jeff goldblum can be very good but hes not capable of overcoming miscasting as a cia operative he looks almost as uncomfortable in the role as i was watching him in it his cia sidekick is worse he looks like a refugee from the quarterfinals of american idol are there really young cia agents with big licks of hair rakishly draped over their foreheads then theres the sticky question of the characters ages goldblum was 54 when he made fay grim thomas jay ryan who plays henry fool was 44 neither was made to look or seem older than their actual ages yet a key point in the story is that they served as cia agents in nicaragua back in the 70s goldblums character wouldve been in his 20s then henry fool wouldve been a teenager was hartley being quirky or lazy the problems are too numerous to list
0,my dad is a fan of columbo and i had always disliked the show i always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is but he goes on watching it none the less that is his right as an american i guess but my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that spielberg had directed the premier episode it was then that i was thankful that my dad had bought this show that i really cant stand i went through his dvd collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college my opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed but i did gain respect for spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors and that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along get the pun haha like spielberg did its like jesus before he became a man or thats at least what i think that would feel like any ways if your fan of columbo than you would most likely like this even though it contains little of peter falk i attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet this episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of columbos investigation as many later episodes would do
6,jamie foxx is fun but this movie has been done before the bad guy plays a malkovichian character from in the line of fire the cops will do anything to find the bad guy  and of course the good guy has two sets of bad guys and one set of cops after him  all the while he is just trying to turn over a new leaf
7,and this movie has crossed it i have never seen such a terrible movie in my life i mean a kids head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled a snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible this was a pitiful excuse for a movie
4,heres an excellent barbara stanwyck double bill on one disc the first movie  and believe me the lesser of the two  is mgms to please a lady 1950 in which she is paired with clark gable it is essentially a star vehicle with gable as usual dominating the film with his screen presence here he plays a macho racing driver who gets some bad press from feminist reporter stanwyck and the battle of the sexes begins of course after much ado they eventually end up in each others arms and it all comes to a predictable and pleasing close a bit of a fluff of a move really but gable and stanwyck  two icons of the golden age  make it watchablebr br but the real meat on this dvd is the second feature  a marvellous and quite unknown little thriller called jeopardy produced by mgm in 1953 this is a wonderful little gem of a movie that hasnt dated one iota here stanwyck plays the wife of barry sullivan and mother to their young son lee aaker on vacation on a deserted and remote mexican beach when suddenly tragedy strikes a dilapidated wooden pier collapses trapping sullivan under a heavy pylon and guess what yesthe tide is coming in with not a soul in sight and unable to free him herself stanwyck sets off by car for assistance after driving some distance the only aid she can muster comes from an unscrupulous escaped convict ralph meeker who  in return for his help  wants more from her than money or a change of clothes ill do anything to save my husband does she or doesnt she br br meeker runs away with the picture he turns in quite a brilliant performance once he comes into the film you simply cannot take your eyes off him an actor in the smouldering brando style he surprisingly never made much of his career in films although he gave splendid performances as the unsavoury disgraced cavalry officer in the outstanding mannstewart western naked spur 1953 and as one of the doomed sacrificial french troopers in stanley kubricks powerful ww1 drama paths of glory 1957 his only real claim to fame was as mike hammer in mickey spillanes kiss me deadly in 1955 his performance in jeopardy should have done wonders for him but he had only a soso career in films he died in 1988br br because of this release jeopardy can now proudly take its rightful place as a classic noir a memorable taut and exciting thriller thanks to fine performances tight direction by john sturges the crisp monochrome cinematography of victor milner and an atmospheric score by dimitri tiomkin extras however are no great shakes except for a radio version of jeopardy and trailers for both moviesbr br this disc is also part of a barbara stanwyck box set celebrating her centenary hard to believe that the lady would be over 100 years old if she was still aroundbr br jeopardy  an mgm winner
0,this is undeniably the scariest game ive ever played its not the average shooteverythingthatmoves kind of fps which i usually dont care much for but the acceptable gfx interesting weapons and magic great surround soundeffects scryeeee scryeeee and above all incredible atmosphere i love the scrye which enables you at certain places in the games to see or hear events that happened there in the past the only game ive had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere im a great horror fan escpecially of clive barkers stories and movies and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story 910 because im no fps fan and perhaps the game was a bit short
1,ive never been a huge fan of mormon films being a mormon ive always felt that the humor was too exclusive to the lds community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive wackos i was hoping this would be the breath of fresh air the halestorm movie i could finally discuss with my nonmormon friendsbr br boy was i wrongbr br i figured since this had blist talent like clint howard gary coleman andrew wilson and fred willard one of my favorites this would have to be at least a little funny and besides church basketball is ripe with potential for plenty of hilarious gags and such but i must say throughout the entire movie it seemed as though no one knew what they were doing every joke fell flat and every opportunity for a genuinely funny gag went ignored the dialogue was bland and the film had some of the worst character development i have ever seen every single character but wilsons was less than onedimensional its hard to believe that after nine rewrites the film was still as mindnumbingly stale as the train wreck i witnessed i cant put into words the rage i felt sitting through this my friends and i were extras in the final game scene so we went to the premiere in washington city ut kurt hale the director was there and i must say i avoided all contact with him after the show he waited at the door seemingly ready for feedback i couldnt bring myself to tell him that his film not only ripped away a good hour and a half of my life but it left a nasty painful scar that i will never forgetbr br here are a few specific problems i had there was a minor love story subplot between the janitor and the chubby piano player but these two characters came out of nowhere and were impossible to care about so my friends and i were left constantly wondering why we were supposed to care about these two lame uninteresting characters there were many subplots that popped up every now and then each promising the audience the chance for laughs but each one came and went in a puff of smoke ending before you could even start caring this was pretty much how the whole movie feltbr br this film was a major letdown and i feel bad for everyone whos expecting the first real funny mormon movie true the jokes in this one arent too exclusive to mormons then again its hard to tell what was a joke and what was a loud ringing sensation in my earsbr br please do not see this movie keep in your mind the fantasy that this movie is hilarious spare yourself the disappointment i went through
7,this is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever i emphasize ever made whats worse my old hero dolph is in it and hes starring it jesus the story is actually quite good but the way its carried out made even my body hurt the fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter the actors except for dolph who kinda sucks also perform so badly you cant help but wonder if their reason for being there is that theyre all friends of the director who by the way must have been absent most if not all of the time this is 12 million spent in an unimaginable way because by the look of the effects and scenery the cost cant be a cent above 1000
2,notorious for more than a quarter century and often banned its obscurity was its greatest asset it seems hey its often better to be talked about rather than actually seen when you cant back the legend up with substancebr br the film has played in los angeles a couple of times recently and is available on home video so that veil is slowly being lifted while there is still plenty to offend the masses it is more likely to bore them than arouse much real passion except for a gratuitous and protracted xxx sex scene between a pair of horses nature documentary anyone there follows nearly an hour of a dull arranged marriage melodrama br br once the sex and nudity begins it is a nonstop sequence involving masturbation a looooooooong flashback to an alleged beauty and the beast encounter and a naked woman running around the mansion nobody even her supposedly protective aunt seems to even think of putting some clothes on her on video i guess you can fastforward thru the banality but its not really worth the effort the nudity doesnt go beyond what is seen in something much more substantive such as bertoluccis the dreamersbr br try as one might to find some moral or symbolism in the carnality i doubt its worthy of anyones effort unfortunately for la bete now that you can more easily see the film the notoriety of something once forbidden has been lifted and this beast has been tamed
2,im 60 years old a guitarist leadrhythm and over the last forty years ive been in four bands its all there the fights the foulups the rotten food the worse accommodation always travelling little or no money and every one was drunk or high but the clubs the fans and the music made it all worth it just like strange fruit im too damn old for it now and the arthritis in the hands and hips mean no more rocking but for the length of that video it all came back and it was all there the birds the brawls and the booze and i was young again its just like billy connollys voice over god likes that 70s stuff rock on forever
0,this film is so bad it made me want to vomit poorly produced a complete laugh free zone why in the name of god would you spoof a movie which to a degree is a spoof and a damn funny one at that as it stands the sets are laughable the effects so bad that they arent even laughable and the acting farcical it is a complete mystery why you would even consider watching this lump of garbage national lampoon once made animal house which people still consider to be completely and utterly hilarious now theyve been relegated to making tv movies like this lump of  name your expletive and it could be accurately used to describe this film
0,this movie is amazing the plot was justwowbr br i was very surprised by gackts and hydes performance after growing up in the american world of the actors who cant sing and singers who cant actbr br in this movie a young sho gackt comes across a vampire kei hyde over time they form an unlikely friendship kei is suffering because of how he is forced to live off others the halflife of a vampirebr br its a sad movie but not sappy the plot was very unique and contrary to your typical vampire flick the storyline was thick with twists and turns and very entrancingbr br the only fault i would say the movie had despite its lack of a happyalbeit peacefulending would be its multiple languages i had the unsubdued version im lucky that i understood it all save some of the cantonese so i would recommend getting something with subtitlesbr br all in all the movie was just awesome
1,well were to start this is by far one of the worst films ive ever paid good money to see i wont comment on the story itself its a wonderful classic but here it feels like a soap opera to start with the acting except for eric bana is soap opera quality ive always been a fan of brad pitt but here every actor on the bold and the beautiful puts him to shame the camera action doesnt help either how it lingers on him when hes thinking it just takes me back to brooke forresters days in the lab peter otoole has either had a really bad plastic surgery or he is desperately in need of one either way he looks more like linda evans than linda evans and to end my comments diane kruger is a cute girl but she sure is no helen of troy peterson should rather have chosen saffron burrows for the role since elizabeth taylor would be rather miscast by now
7,envy stars some of the best jack black ben stiller amy poehler and the great christopher walken with such a cast one can only expect the best however with envy no one could save this disasterbr br tim dingman stiller and nick vanderpark black are best friends and coworkers at a sandpaper factory both are making a decent living but because tim has a better performance at work hes able to afford more than his buddy nick nick is a dreamer whos always coming up with new ideas for inventions one day nick comes up with the idea for a spray can that makes dog poop disappear yes im serious falling in love with the idea nick decides to really invent this product he makes an offer to tim to invest in his idea and share the profits 5050 tim refuses thinking the idea will never workbr br nicks invention titled vapoorize again im serious ends up making millions he enjoys spending his money on things like a much larger house a horse a personal trainer and fancy deserts tim starts feeling envy for nick hence the name of the moviebr br the concept isnt bad but it still turns out awful this movie contains some of the worst dialog and very poor performances from all the cast then again as i mentioned earlier none of them could save this mess not even the great christoper walken playing a homeless character named jman made this movie funny the movie is bad from the start and only continues to get worsebr br i recommend this movie if you like crap no pun intended you want to see jack black in a white tuxbr br i say avoid this movie at all costs but avoid especially if youre offended by bathroom humor you love animals
2,it is not known whether marilyn monroe ever met and spoke with albert einstein and since the mysterious disappearance of her diary after her equally mysterious death we may never know but in their lifetime the opportunity was therebr br scripted by terry johnson from his own play nicolas roegs insignificance imagines an encounter in a new york hotel room one night in 1953 between the two icons plus joe dimaggio busey and senator joseph mccarthy curtis  but only on one level on another level it elevates  or reduces  these personalities and what a lousy phrase that is to mere avatars the characters are deliberately unnamed at once greater and lesser in statusbr br the title insignificance is both apposite and deeply ironic here dimaggios net worth has been reduced to little more than a picture on a bubblegum card monroe too is reduced to her constituent parts of dress hair lipstick wiggle and voice by uncovering their insecurities and reversing their roles the film brings into sharp focus received notions of celebrity exploding the cult of personalitybr br furthering the theme there will be another explosion at the films climax hiroshima in a hotel suite in which the actress is burned to a cinder in seconds a literal deconstruction of fame goodbye norma jean history informs the script which in turn shakes history upside down as roeg mused after watching johnsons play for the first time these characters were mythic not invented by any single person not the public or the press probably not even by the characters themselves as played by theresa russell marilyn a closet intellectual in real life lectures a childlike einstein the professor played by emil on the theory of relativity using balloons and a flashlight while getting the professor to show off his legs in conscious parody of her own role in the sevenyear itch the movie the actress is seen to be working on in the films openingbr br history records that monroes thenhusband fading baseball star dimaggio played by busey as a tenderly psychotic simpleton was unhappy about her iconic dresssplaying scene in the film precipitating their breakup right on cue we discover the jealous ballplayer in a bar bemoaning the fact that if i want to see her underwear i just walk down to the corner like all the other guysbr br in contrast to the professor the ballplayer believes the universe is round  a contention shared by native americans but the big chief sampson of one flew over the cuckoos nest fame who operates the roosevelt hotels elevator has been all but disenfranchised from his own culture i no longer cherokee  i watch tv meanwhile the senator is investigating the professor who is on the eve of delivering a pacifist speech to the united nations but whom the senator suspects is a red in fact as he divulges to monroe einstein is wracked with guilt over hiroshima and what the white heat future holds yet in a seemingly godless universe all such worries and aspirations are rendered insignificant in the light of a higher atomic powerbr br roeg really is the perfect director to bring johnsons stage play to the screen throughout tortured childhood flashbacks and pessimistic flashforwards kaboom draw unexpected connections between time place and circumstance with the repeated visual motif of a wristwatch employed to mark times passing  but perhaps also to suggest all time is one time each moment coexisting as evinced by his back catalogue its something of a hobbyhorse for a director enchanted with the notion of synchronicity  see dont look now in particular here 1920 bleeds into 1945 and dripfeeds into the 1980s a period in which another actor has taken on his greatest role as the president of the united statesbr br if all this sounds rather heavy going quantum physics is surely involved the execution is anything but owing to johnsons witty zippy screenplay roegs playful direction opening out an essentially stagey setup  and the cast themselves who are on stellar form tony curtis especially leaves denture marks in the wood panelling as the paranoid impotent senator who is seen attempting congress with a monroe impersonator a real one as opposed to russells before being let down by his dwindling memberbr br of course curtis once costarred with the real marilyn monroe in some like it hot and whose embrace he memorably described as like kissing hitler as roeg commented everything suddenly seemed connected when the film began to take shape even the actors themselves seemed part of this endless linking it all goes into the pot to be boiled down and served up in new and fascinating ways
4,after the initial shock of realizing the guts of mr branagh to film this i was literally shaking with the excitement of having this epic just ahead of me i was not disappointed so true to shakespeare and yet so accessible it blew my mind i always enjoy seeing or rather listening to branagh and it made me wonderis this movie dubbed in other countries that would be like painting a moustache on the mona lisa
2,full house is a great family show however after watching some episodes over and over again ive realized that theyre incredibly boring and they seem to shelter themselves from the outside world a lot yes there is a lot of comedy but there are times when its incredibly cheesy its not like i hate it but just dont watch them over and over again because they get old quick probably the best season is the firstbr br full house is about widower danny tannerbob sagetand his three daughters dj candace cameron stephanie jodie sweetin and michelle marykate and ashley when dannys wife dies the he is in need of some help so his best friend joey dave coulier and the girls uncle jesse john stamos moves in with them once they live there together they find they cant live without each other br br full house reminds you just how important family is and that you can always go home again
7,this movie is ok if you like mindless action corny acting and a very small plot the special effects are decent considering this movie is from the director ofevent horizon the costumes are like something from a mad max movie none of the soldiers talk so others tell them what to doit eventually end up as a big shootem up movie with explosions all the place i personally liked russell better in tango and cashescape from lanew york and executive decision it must see this movie leave your mind at the door for a no brainer action science fiction movie
4,horrible horrible horrible do not waste your money to rent this movie its like a low budget made for tv canadian movie absolutely the worst movie i have ever seen and there have been many others out there this movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the dvd player or vcr   is it possible to write ten lines the acting was horrific it had absolutely no flow i saw the made for tv movie on the btk killer and it was much betterin comparison to this one i am not sure what they were going for in producing this film but if it was to educate us or tell a story about the btk killer they missed by a mile it appeared to be more of a infomercial for animal rights
0,a superb and compelling drama about the hunt for the notorious russian serial killer andrea chikatilo magnificent performance from stephen rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the russian government in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed societybr br the film is has an underlying theme about the decline of the communist society and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in social and political change in russia which is subtly put across there is a conflict of old ways and new ways and these are represented by the two viewpoints of reas superior played by donald sutherland and rea himself  these are at first polarised with sutherland high in system looking down and rea low on the ground looking up however they have a common cause  to catch the serial killerbr br throughout the film the relationship between these two develops and the tension gradually eases until at the end of the movie rea and sutherland and rea and sutherland have mutual respect for each other the killer is caught and glasnost symbolically comes excellent scriptbr br further credits go to sutherlands performance which is superb and sympathetic jeffrey demunn as the killer whom we despise but cant hate and max von sydow who is thoroughly convincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help
4,admirably odd though meanspirited comedydrama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through the houston astrodome robert altmandirected quasicomedy with eccentric characters is so overloaded with weirdos that it starts to creak early on from the weight some of the cinematography is evocative shelley duvall is a stitch in her debut as a tour guide and sally kellerman looks every inch the glamourpuss as bud corts vision of a mother bird imagine altman and producer lou adler explaining that role to her in the lead bud cort isonce again after harold  maudea true original not offputting like say michael j pollard cort manages to be geeky wacky and inoffensive a tough act to pull off unfortunately this is one of altmans misfires he can put together a cast and a showpiece like no one else but let him get fired up with some misguided inspiration and he spirals downward  from 
4,although this was obviously a lowbudget production the performances and the songs in this movie are worth seeing one of walkens few musical roles to date he is a marvelous dancer and singer and he demonstrates his acrobatic skills as well  watch for the cartwheel also starring jason connery a great childrens story and very likable characters
1,spoiler i love branagh love helena bonhamcarter loved them together in mary shelleys frankenstein  but this br br i can understand an actors desire to stretch to avoid the romantic stereotype well they did but really  the script droned on bonhamcarters clothes were tres chic and the occasional speededup madcap sequence could have been an outtake from a beatles movie or the old rowan and martin laughinbr br i never got the point  other commenters say the branagh character was a dreamer i never felt that he was a loser and not very bright and certainly not endearing the business with the bank robber disguise was merely painful to watch certainly not amusingbr br bonhamcarters realistic one supposes attempts as realistic speech were harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of lancashire accent in full montybr br the poetic ending with him high on a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his airplane was too orchestrated was there a choir of angels or merely a soundtrackbr br go back to the classics or something with a spine and an arc to it donate this to pbsbr br 
1,this movie was packed pull of endless surprises just when you thought it couldnt get worse they added more joints and more pink fuzzylined vans with raunchy sex scenes as you can guess i was a victim of the original version we were tricked into watching it thinking it was supervan the host box which promised lasars jail breaks and much more who would have thought a dollar store christmas present could have been so much fun

1,that reviewers liked this movie surprises me the plot is a muddle the characters are wooden michael bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and misjudging all of them no one has any redeeming quality or pointofinterest this is not an edgy work it is not imaginative it is not ironic it is no clever there is nothing straight forward about this tedious work that is missed theatrical release is not surprise that the this network airs it diminishes that venue i definitely recommend turning to a rerun of the garden smart show on pbs or even a good informational if you encountered this mess on late night television if you encounter it on daytime television take a long walk even if you walk in smog you will feel better not having suffered through this shambles life is short this movie is long
0,i agree with what veinbreaker wrote with regards to the ahhhh feeling you get at the end of this movie i absolutely loved the locations they chose to film the songs were well written and interesting especially the psychedelic sounding track on which hans matheson sings its trippy nighy was fab in his role nail nailed it beano was the typical drummer and rea kept it together bruce robinson was awesome helena was a lovely girlfriend but i felt juliet aubreys performance was gorgeous the scenes between aubrey  robinson killed me perfectly played and the music behind the scene was spot on too bad not many more musicians have checked this movie out they ought toive told all my musician friends great quote by jimmy nails character its supposed to be rock  roll not the phantom of the fg opera
7,i really felt cheated after seeing this picture it felt like i sat watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing i dont understand what they were thinking when they made this it hardly gets into jeffrey dahmer murdering and it has no ending it felt almost like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel it was like watching a television episode of the sopranos it ends suddenly and you know theres going to be another episode next week it also felt like i just watched part to a two part movie there are many possibilities for what went wrong here they got lazy they ran out of money they didnt know the rest of the story they wanted to make a dahmer after seeing this movie they all sound very accurate i was watching jeffrey dahmer walking through the woods all of a sudden i hear this music playing then writing comes on the screen and says how dahmer served years of his sentence and was attacked by a fellow inmate and killed at the age of 34 wow he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in jail how about showing how he got there how about showing dahmers trial how about showing some more detail i cant even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place i actually found myself saying in disbelief thats it thats the end i want to conclude this review by saying there is still a good dahmer movie yet to be made to the filmmakers id like to say if youre going to do it do it right
6,first off to give you some idea of my taste in moviesbr br 2007 comedies i enjoyed superbad knocked up hot fuzz blades of glory br br 2007 comedies i hated evan almighty the brothers solomon good luck chuckbr br i should have followed my first instinct and turned off hot rod after i got to about the 20 minute mark i knew by that point that this movie would not make me laugh once the script is absolutely brutal  i have no idea how this monstrosity managed to crack on imdb any one older than 10 years old who enjoyed this must be some kind of mental defectivebr br this doesnt come close to anything with will farrell and its clear that andy samberg cant carry anything longer than a to 10 minute sketch on youtube or snl i dont know how they roped ian mcshane and isla fisher into doing this movie they must have owed favors or something i came in knowing that it would be a dumb movie but i thought it would at least be funny i didnt so much as smirkbr br i dont normally comment on movies at imdb but this was so awful i just had to warn people this is only the 4th movie ive seen that ive felt compelled to rate 110
0,this is a nice piece of work very sexy and engaging enough plot to keep my interest throughout its main disadvantage is that it seems like it was madefortv full screen and though there were several sex scenes there was absolutely no nudity but boy did it come close strange too since netflix shows that it was rated rbr br nonetheless very titillating and i wish alicia silverstone made more movies like thisbr br one netflix reviewer stated that it was part of a series but i have been unable to find out what series that is id like to find out though because this movie was that goodbr br walt d in lv 8232005
0,you know how everyone jokes about the acting in porno movies well if youve always found the plot line of a porn to captivate your interest then this movie is for you it truly was like a porn without the sex or if that analogy is not to your liking imagine you and your drunk roommate found a movie camera abandoned on a park bench this is the movie that you would make horrible acting bad camera work music done on a casio keyboard this movie has it all and more for those who are masochists in the crowd this is a premiere piece for your collection br br all i can figure is that the only people to submit reviews for this dripping pile of movie were people who starred in it br br their movie career is over before it started
2,i will warn you here i chose to believe those reviewers who said that this wasnt an action film in the usual sense rather a psychological drama so you should appreciate it on that basis and you will be alrightbr br i am here to tell you that they were wrong completely wrongbr br well no not completely it is very disappointing if you are looking for an action flick they were right about that but it is also very unsatisfying on all other levels as wellbr br tom beringer wasnt too bad i suppose no worse than usual but what possessed them to cast billy zane in this was it some sort of death wish on the part of the producers a way to made their film a guaranteed flop in that case it workedbr br if they were actually aiming for success then why not cast somebody who can act oh and might as well go for a screenwriter who knows how to write ah yes and a director who knows how to directbr br as someone who sat through this mess actually believing it would shortly redeem itself i can assure you it never did pity it couldve been a good film
4,a pretty average scifi film the plot was more or less obvious from the start although the acting was reasonably good the writing seemed very cliched using ideas taken from numerous filmsbr br the basic plot scientists working on a deep space research platform rescue a fighter from crashing into the red dwarf that they have been orbitting onboard they find a stasis pod which coincidently malfunctions at that very moment after or minutes of the man in the pod waking up you realise that he is a complete lunatic something which totally escapes the person crew of the research shipbr br after that it becomes a rip off every other film involving a psychotic madman terrorising innocent victims overall i think speed was a better exploration of the subject matter which i didnt consider to be a good film eitherbr br not a good film get aliens out and watch that againbr br 
7,i can give you four reasons to see this moviebr br four of the best filmmakers in the contemporary mexican cinemabr br four good stories related into a big schemebr br a surprisingly good castbr br a bitter reflexion about the biggest trouble in this country and many othersbr br possible spoilersbr br alejandro gamboa opens this movie with a good story in a comedic mood about the authority practicing the extortion against regular people and still expecting to be appreciated by its efforts br br then antonio serrano gets more dramatic in the second piece with a story heir to the italian neorealism with a peter and the wolflike anecdotebr br in the third story the one that seems more independent from this series even in the context carlos carrera tells us the story of a man being at the wrong place in the wrong moment but after the recent lynching at tlahuac and the tradition in this awful matter at the state of mexico this story couldnt be more updatedbr br and at the end fernando sariana returns to the dark humor in the grand finale in which he puts together the most of the characters from the past sequences in one of the better comedy pieces ever filmed reprising the center scene from one of his previous films todo el poder sariana gives the final lesson of the theme and by the way give us the scene that steals the movie with anna ciochetti making a brief stripteasebr br once the movie has ended you get a bittersweet feeling about having looked at a good movie and maybe enjoyed it with a very painful subject they say that in mexico people laugh at their own disgrace and this is the best example this film is a testimony of how mexicans have learn to live in the middle of a crime stateand perhaps accepted it between two fires the criminals and the socalled authorities full of corruption even this movie is a wishful thinking because almost all the good people have been a victim of crime and they dont get this unhurt if you had an assault without a scratch then youre lucky meanwhile dont lose the chance to see this movie highly recommendedbr br and its a beautiful life in mexico
2,im not sure under what circumstances director visconti decided to film james cains novel the postman always rings twice im not even sure if viscounti acquired the books rights but the resulting movie is definitely interesting it is not the best version of cains story i like the 1981 version best but thanks to viscontis excellent direction and the casting of clara calamai and massimo girotti a very sensual couple it is a must for noir fans visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect the film is not perfect though my main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good the story moves at a very slow pace i dont think visconti was very good at editing his films i think film noir works better with a short running time fortunately calamai and girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested anyhow as much as i like this film and the remakes i think no one has made the definitive version of cains muchpraised book
1,what can i say about this film that hasnt already been said well to tell the truth alot of it looks very fake like some of the slaps and the kicks how charlie sheen though this was real i dont know im sure they would be hitting and kicking her alot harder if it was however the scenes with the pinching and the hot oil look very real and the final needle in the eye scene is amazingly done and is probibly the only thing on film that has ever shocked me

5,with a special telescope dr janos rukh boris karloff successfully proves that years ago a meteorite landed in africa containing an unknown but extremely powerful element dr benetbela lugosi form an expedition led by rukh to locate the element unexpectedly rukh discovers radium x even more powerful than radium and very radioactive and karloff becomes contaminated and can kill anyone by just touching them the sparks really fly between lugosi and karloff in this classic sciencefiction film during the postworld war ii era director hillyer used a few standing sets from flash gordon series which was being filmed at the same time and also inserted some footage of electrical machines from frankenstein universal kept the public unaware of the special effects being used in this great classic film karloff and lugosi were at their very best and they both enjoyed working together and will be enjoyed by future generations
6,this is one of my favorite movies of all time i loved rain man with dustin hoffman and tom cruise this movie is in some ways similar but makes rain man seem artificial shallow unemotional and trivial by comparison
6,a great 90s flick parker posey is fabulous in this story about the nightlife in manhattan that requires so much cash posey gives an amazing performance as a librarian and a night crawler this is a good light movie for saturday night before you go out the soundtrack rocks the outfits are out of this world the script is funny and the actors do a great job the redeeming value  you can make it in this world if you try just find your niche i believe parker posey is the perfect actress for this kind of character young fabulous and broke you must look up the movie clockwatchers  if you watch party girl you are bound to have a good time enjoy
1,bottom of the barrel unimaginative and practically unwatchable remake of the road warrior this film follows the exact plot as the filipino film stryker and is worse by far bad acting dialog effects dubbing pacing action sequences the list goes on and on italy made literally dozens of road warrior ripoffs in the early 80s some good some bad this is the worst by far no contest not only was the mood of the film completely bleak and miserable the experience of sitting through this one is a bore and a half there was one good chase sequence towards the beginning of the movie and a cool shot of a man holding a hand grenade exploding but everything else about this movie seriously reeks for actual postnuke fun go track down a copy of endgame after the fall of new york or escape from the bronx instead theyre much more enjoyable than this rubbish
1,the first half of this version was the best ive seen and i think ive seen every version of jane eyre ever made the development of janes childhood and character were exceptional then it was as though someone said uh oh this is running too long and hacked the rest of the story to shreds the major scenes when included at all are glossed over combined and put out of order in such a way that they completely change the storyline there was so little transition or even scene development that it would be difficult for anyone not familiar with the story even to follow the big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope and then the end dashed it
2,ive found the movie offensive for americans which lost somebody in the towers for american people in general pretending to be an homage to horrible facts happened last years each director takes the opportunity to polemize with old facts which have none to do with a terrorist attack or criticize americans political behaviour or compare different political situation as they have in own country having this nothing to do or to share with the atrocity of september 11 shame on them
7,spoiler this movie is about such a concept williams will go to any low in order to replay the football game that haunts his life russel plays the ex jock who peaked in high school finally the under dog get its shot and williams can save face instead of being the clown a great reverse tragedy 710
5,i cant say much about this film i think it speaks for itself as do the current ratings on here i rented this about two years ago and i totally regretted it i even tried to like it by watching it twice but i just couldnt i can safely say that i have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever ever again and im not one to trash a movie but i truly believe this was awful it wasnt even funny in the slightest the only bits i enjoyed were the few scenes with christopher walken in them i think this film ruined both jack black and ben stiller for me all i can think of when i see one of their films nowadays is this terrible movie and it reminds me not to waste my money amy poehler is so very annoying toobr br overall well i think you get my point the stars are for walken by the way
0,the way the story is developed keeps the audience wondering what is the tenants dark past we get some clues during the series but enough to keep us interested in the miniseries the characters are all believable and i personally felt immersed and surrounded by the story
7,this was the most visually stunning moving amazing and incredible story ive ever experienced quite frankly even those adjectives just cannot describe it i cant just choose one scene that stood out for me i suppose if i had to list a few it would be the reactions of the fireman to the crashing sound of jumping victims the reaction of people trapped in the elevator who were unaware of what was going on as they finally emerge to the horrific scene the shock and disbelief of the onlookers and finally the silence br br on that day and even now i am reminded of star wars 1977 obiwan says i felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced it is amazing how it is so accurate in its description there was truly a disturbance in the forcebr br this documentary vividly reveals this disturbance the feelings are so incredibly visual the anger the frustration the shock the fear the exhaustion and the realization of its very magnitude its all there not a thing is missedbr br this is a powerful and most moving documentary and well deserving of the emmy not just because it documents 911 but because it is simply everything it should be br br if you plan to watch be sure to grab a box of tissues youll need them i know that i did
0,this is a good example of how not to make a filmbr br there is very little meaningful dialog no context for the events and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes the result is a confused clueless viewer the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the directors commentarybr br this movie has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is with an emphasis on child abuse it includes some stock footage of real horrible acts of violence including war time executions although it works in the context of the movie i feel that the ideas behind the movie could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content this film is absolutely not for the weak stomached or the easily offended and should not under any circumstances be shown to minorsbr br the climax is anticlimactic compared to the content of the rest of the movie if youre not listening to the commentary while it happens you will probably miss itbr br the directors commentary was a oneshot sit the guy down and let him talk no cuts type of commentary while this isnt necessarily bad the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes at a time complaining about his college filming conditions co producers bad film and a dozen other things the constant negativity detracts from what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the moviebr br the movie was shot many years ago on 16mm and super8 film over a period of four years on an extremely low budget because of this the video and audio quality is poor that alone does not make it a bad movie but it does make a bad movie worse
0,spoiler warningbr br first of all i rated this movie out of 10br br the idea is good but there are too many stupid errors in the movie failing to make it the psyching drama that it might have been first of all she never fights alone after an initial very strange doubt from her mother which is not believable when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the movie the rape victim is not alone br br she is also unbelievably naive always falling into the crews strange traps br br her friends are unbelievably nastybr br the thing that i find most unbelievably is that ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his opinon ethan is very much the leader of the crew hey they even say so and people seem to think the other guy is a jerk but when ethan changes his opinion he just doesnt manage to convince even one single person in the crew that he is right and that his former friend is wrong everyone just simply hates him why the movie provides no explanation how did he ever become the leaderbr br a funny note is that my girlfriend thought i was watching beverly hills when she came in two actors from the same successful tvseries a cheap way to get viewers
5,istanbul is another one of those expatriate films that errol flynn was making in the last decade of his life trying to support his family and stay out of trouble with the irs its a remake of the fred macmurray ava gardner film singapore from a decade agobr br unlike that studio product istanbul has the advantage of that great location cinematography right at the sight of the golden horn but errol flynn who was aging exponentially before the camera in every film was way too old to be playing these actionadventure types any longer his scenes with cornell borchers really do lack convictionbr br as for cornell she plays errols former sweetheart who through the trauma of being saved from a fire now has amnesia she both doesnt remember errol and is now married to torin thatcher br br but errols got some nasty people led by martin benson and werner klemperer who are after some diamonds which have come into his possession got to deal with them toobr br best reason to see istanbul is to hear nat king cole sing and play the piano most people today dont realize that cole was an accomplished jazz pianist they only think of him as a singer actually he was a pianist first the singing was an afterthoughtbr br istanbul is a routine actionadventure film for those who are fans of that type of movie
0,the summary pretty much sums it all up this is nowhere near as good as the original with a script cowritten by both stallone and james cameron at the same time he was also writing aliens most of the action was written by cameron and the political aspects were written by stallonebr br sly was in the best condition physically as he was making this and rocky and he does look in great shape or jacked up to the eyeballs on steroids depending on your own viewpoint or opinionbr br rambo starts off in prison and is visited by colonel trautman who asks him to go on a special mission that could earn him a presidential pardon he eventually agrees and goes off to the briefing camp run by charles napier playing a washington suit trying to pass himself off as former exforces to placate rambobr br the mission is to find out if there are any missing pows still alive in camps in vietnam rambo was chosen as the camp he was checking was somewhere he had previously been a prisoner himself he is told its not a rescue mission and he is there to take recon photos onlybr br after a bad attempt at parachuting from a plane he loses most of his kit meets his contact who turns out to be a cute woman and travels down river with pirates to the campbr br he finds there are still prisoners and rescues one as the flee from half the vietnamese army on their river boat they are betrayed by the pirates but rambo kills them all and they are forced to carry on to the pickup point on foot after their boat is rammed and blown up with rambo almost on boardbr br rambo is betrayed again and abandoned as napier orders the recall of the rescue helicopter it is clear as trautman returns to base to berate him that no survivors were expected to be foundbr br steven berkoff turns up as a russian spetznatz colonel and rambo is tortured and eventually escapes only to be pursued by more vietnamese troops and spetznatz killing many of them rambo finally steals a chopper and rescues most of the prisoners to return to his basebr br he resists the urge to kill napier for abandoning him but destroys the ops centrebr br a weak plot and very weak ending as rambo walks off into the sunset as a free man
0,i am a fan of the nightmare series but this one is horrible the deaths are so trendy if you were to watch this 20 years later the whole nintendo scene is outdated i did like the flashbacks i think they should have just made a prequel about when he was still alive that would have been more interesting this is a movie you can take or leave depends on how much spare time you have
4,i saw this film at the toronto film festival where it received a standing ovation this film tells a story that to my knowledge has never been told beforenamely about the rosenstrasse a street in berlinuprising of german gentile women who were married to jews at the end of the second world war as such it is a unique story and whats more is the only film about the holocaust that i have ever seen that shows that there were good germans the helping family in anne frank for instance was dutch who did not support the nazis and in fact had the fortitude to stand up against their own countrys immorality and brutality during the nazi regime at the risk of their very lives the acting is great across the board the framing story in new york interesting and intricate the direction from von trotta masterful in every scene and the production values including the gorgeous cinematography outstanding of course the family in new york could be speaking german many immigrants in this country choose to speak in their native tongue with their familya common occurrence so that criticism is unwarranted to say more would spoil the experience the film is long but i did not look at my watch once i am hoping this film gets some distribution is north america for not only is this film a masterpiece but it can actually help heal any animosity people have towards the germans because of their support of hitler if this film is playing in your area i urge you to see it you will be glad you did
0,if another hitler ever arises it will be thanks in part to nonsense like this film which propagates the absurd notion that he was a visibly deranged lunatic from the start far from following such a person and electing him to the highest office in the land sane people would cross the street to avoid him and he would have died in a ditch nameless and unknownbr br anyone who reads the accounts of hitlers close companions  the autobiography of his secretary traudl junge for instance  will be struck by the fact that people found him a kindly intelligent generous man he was also a brilliant orator and the fact that his speeches seem overblown and ranting to modern ears ignores the times in which they were made when strutting pomposity was common in political speeches ditto the overstated antisemitism which was neither a central plank of the early nazis  who were primarily anticommunist  nor uncommon or unusual for the times the film makes it look as though hitlers sole ambition from the start was the holocaustbr br if you want to identify the next person who will cause the death of tens of millions you can ignore flecklipped ravers life the one portrayed here look instead for a charming charismatic man whose compelling speeches inspire the entire nation and whose political work visibly and materially benefits the country im afraid his personality will be much more like barack obamas than fred phelpsbr br i hoped for much here and got nothing but caricature the fools who made this thing perpetrated a crime against reality this is the historical equivalent of reefer madness
1,this is one of the best films i have seen in years i am not a gwyneth paltrow fan but she is excellent as emma woodhouse alan cumming is superb as reverand elton and emma thompsons sister sophie is hysterical as miss bates and check out the gorgeous jeremy northam as mr knightley what a gentleman whoever said you need sex and violence in a movie to make it good has never seen emma i think that is what separates it from so many othersits classybr br if youre looking for a film that you can watch with the whole family or looking for a romance for yourself look no further emma is that movie with a beautiful setting wonderful costumes and an outstanding cast have i mentioned the gorgeous jeremy northam emma is a perfect ten

0,is this the same kim ki duk who directed the poignant lifespanning testimonial of spring summer fall winter and spring the same kim ki duk who directed the exquisite nearly silent heartbreaking longing of iron the same kim ki duk who dazzled us with the staggering tragedy of the coast guard and made us squirm about the ugliness of nonchalant teenage prostitution before returning to his almost patented nature motif to allow us all characters and viewers alike to experience redemption in samaritan girl i just cannot seem to find him in this filmbr br oh sure kims nature motif is still present the film takes place entirely on a lake surrounded by mountains and on fishing floats resting placidly on the surface of calm waters yes its kim ki duk all right kim even describes the film as beautiful in an interview included in the dvds special features but im not sure anymore what that means after viewing this putrescent presentationbr br what is beautiful about angry pottymouthed prostitutes lustful violent and pottymouthed fishermen a covetous mute merchant explicit animal torture sequences of selfmutilation and a pace that swings nauseatingly between bestial carnality and mindless brutality these are the only elements of humanity that present themselves in this utterly confounding and ultimately pointless film if it is based on a fable or intended as a parable or is meant to be symbolic of something greater this reviewer is unfamiliar with the source material it has been favorably compared to audition by japanese director takashi miike much to kims satisfaction but aside from some astonishingly good performances especially given what they had to work with by lead actors seo jung and kim yoo suk i find little reason to recommend this film i have not seen audition but i doubt it would alter in any way my view of the isle its violence is pornographic and senselessly sadistic its sex is not pornographic but passionless and masochistic characters behave on irritating impulse because there is no plot its point is either nonexistent or i will admit lost amidst korean cultural quirks that i fail to understandbr br the only beauty is in the cinematography which is classic kim fogshrouded boats lapping slowly across a serene lake mountainous terrain dominating the background and an imaginative and playful use of color at times it seems as if viewers are locked in a big kim ki duk romper room some touches like the mysterious and seductive mute merchant played by jung and the pleasantly odd use of motorbikes are intriguing but as a film this effort is downright confusing and in the end offensive to the senses not necessarily to sensibilities one hopes that kim will leave this kind of filmmaking in the trash heap of his past for we know he is capable of so much more
1,there were a lot of truly great horror movies produced in the seventies  but this film certainly isnt one of them its a shame the child isnt better as it works from a decent idea that takes in a couple of sometimes successful horror themes we have the idea of a vengeful child which worked so well in classic films such as the bad seed and then we have the central zombie theme which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie the plot is basically this young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge as you do this is all well and good except for the fact that its boring nothing happens for most of the film and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore its not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it the film was obviously shot on a budget as the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish theres really not much i can say about the film overall as there isnt much to it the child is a dismal seventies horror flick and i certainly dont recommend it
1,i absolutely loved this movie when i was a kid i cried every time i watched it it wasnt weird to me i totally identified with the characters i would love to see it again and hope i wont be disappointed pufnstuf rocks i was really drawn in to the fantasy world and to me the movie was loooong i wonder if i ever saw the series and have confused them the acting i thought was strong i loved jack wilde he was so dreamy to an 10 year old when i first saw the movie not in 1970 i can still remember the characters vividly the flute was totally believable and i can still feel the evil woods witchy poo was scary  i wouldnt want to cross her path
0,the film lacks style i mean original style everything looks copied including action first appearances in the movie songs dialog delivery etc etc yes there the goofups were original like in the beginning a car is shown with number up number and few seconds later it starts falling down a hill with number mh  that was one in many goofups of the movie  anything good in the movie yes for kareena fans if there are any kareena in bikini for akshay fans his dialogs and action stunts thats it nothing else so watch it on your own risk and dont blame the director or actors director is already insane and actors i pity them
7,i saw this in the theater during its initial release and it was disturbing then as im sure it would still be it was the first part of 68 and this was still making the rounds in towns across america and there had recently been a massmurder in my hometown where i saw this where a man went on a shooting rampage the freshness of that closetohome event combined with this dramatized true story made for a very disturbing theatrical experience it really brought to life the excellent acting of robert blake and scott wilson i was familiar with the novel based on the true event by truman capote and the screenplay and direction by richard brooks wove the event and trumans interpretation into compelling gritty cinematic adaptation music from quincy jones effectively scores its story ive only seen this a couple times since it was too real almost like being a witness to the crime itself and riding along with the killers i would give this a 90 of a possible 10 society is so desensitized to violence and crime today that this probably seems slow and tame and could be viewed with less effect but to anyone over 50 this will be a hallmark into the examination of the criminal psyche
1,whats not to like about this movie every year you know that youre going to get one or two yule tide movies during christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible this movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well a very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real christmas for him what is the good of having money like that if you cant do fun things with it it was a winwin situation a regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience christmas like he imagined only ifbr br drew latham ben affleck was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands it was a fun and funny movie

7,one of those thankgodidontlivethere documentaries this one tells of two warring factions in colombia guerrillas and paramilitaries and the surrounding peoples of medellinbr br guns drugs and death run rampant the guys no older than 22 not in the middle of fighting a war are in jail the girls  not women girls  always react the same way when one of them is killed with tears and screaming you scratch your head what did they expect really i dont know whats more disturbing the nightly shootouts and civil unrest or that everybody just seems to passively accept things as are or seeing that boy drinking what is obviously not his first beer being all of what 10 if you were to take these any of these young men out of their situation and put them some place where they had the opportunity to do more be more how many would choose not to staybr br based on this documentary all im afraid
4,the premise is ridiculous the characters unbelievable the dialogue trite and the ending absurd br br believe me im a fan of kevin kline but watching him do a pepe le pew accent for hours as a supposed frenchman is not nearly as amusing as it soundsbr br for her part meg ryan is once again as perky and adorable as a take your pick kewpie doll baby puppy kitten whatever you happen to think is the cutest creature on earth she also bears not the slightest resemblance to a real human beingbr br this movie strikes me as an opportunity seized by buddies lawrence kasdan and kline to vacation in paris and the south of france while being wellpaid for it so i cant really blame them
6,this film was on late at night when i saw it it was interesting at start but it didnt convince me as a whole i am no tyson fan in fact i dont like boxing at all its barbaric obscene and double faced by society that some get money for beating each other upbr br nevertheless i felt the start of the film was ok actors alright especially george c scott as cus damato i dont know how reliable the flick is i havent read books and books about boxing or tyson i dont know anything about the man but it was quite entertainingbr br as the movie went on i felt it lost a little of its charm and i also lost interest i managed to stay awake though but the last hour was just not good enough
2,film version of sandra bernhards onewoman offbroadway show is gaspingly pretentious sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting and fitfully funny her fans will say shes scathingly honest and that may be true but shes also shrill with an unapologetic inyourface bravado that isnt wellsuited to a film in this genre she doesnt want to make niceand shes certainly not out to make friendsand thats always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way but even if you meet her halfway her material here is seriously lacking filmmaker nicolas roeg served as executive producer and though not directed by him the film does have his chilly detached signature style all over it bernhard cowrote the show with director john boskovich their oddest touch was in having all of sandras inhouse audiences looking completely boreda feeling many real viewers will most likely share 12 from 
0,so i finally saw the film my left foot last night after years of being told by my mother how amazing it is the central performance of daylewis is indeed remarkable and amazing but anyone with even minimal exposure to his other work should expect nothing lessbr br the fatal misjudgement in my eyes was that in becoming obsessed with proving the normalcy of this man the movie chose to show him as a complete and utter jerk on the one hand i can see that this is a logical correlation mankind always has the capacity to be objectionable and disability shouldnt obscure that i just wish that impartial onlookers wouldnt be so forgiving of aberrant behaviour and assume that circumstances automatically make it forgivable they dont acting out is normal and so yes disabled people act out  but they dont do it because theyre disabled they do it because theyre being unreasonable a physical impairment doesnt afford you the right to throw a hissy fit in public just because someone you love turns you downbr br there are certain things it is unwise to do whether you are disabled or ablebodied giving someone tacit permission to boot a football directly at your head for the sole purpose of fitting in is one of them admittedly i did once save a penalty from the schools star striker with my face but i already belonged by then it wasnt for acceptance engaging in a bar brawl is another revelling in the fact that your father only extends companionship to you after youve proved yourself capable of metaphorically jumping through physical hoops takes masochism a step too far all of these things are stupid and suffering through them as a way to demonstrate your bravery doesnt make them any less foolhardybr br so yes just because youve overcome obstacles to achieve great things doesnt make you any less of a jerk being a good person takes priority setting an inspiring example for the disabled should appear way down the list
6,well cube 1997 vincenzos first movie was one of the most interesting and tricky ideas that ive ever seen when talking about movies they had just one scenery a bunch of actors and a plot so what made it so special were all the effective direction great dialogs and a bizarre condition that characters had to deal like rats in a labyrinth his second movie cypher 2002 was all about its story but it wasnt so good as cube but here are the characters being tested like rats againbr br nothing is something very interesting and gets vincenzo coming back to his cube days locking the characters once again in a very different space with no time once more playing with the characters like playing with rats in an experience room but instead of a thriller scifi even some of the promotional teasers and trailers erroneous seemed like that nothing is a loose and light comedy that for sure can be called a modern satire about our society and also about the intolerant world were living once again vicenzo amaze us with a great idea into a so small kind of thing actors and a blinding white scenario thats all you got most part of time and you dont need more than that while cube is a claustrophobic experience and cypher confusing nothing is completely the opposite but at the same time also desperatebr br this movie proves once again that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget of course that the movie fails sometimes but its prime idea means a lot and offsets any flaws theres nothing more to be said about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience that i had in movies since cube
7,when i was little my parents took me along to the theater to see interiors it was one of many movies i watched with my parents but this was the only one we walked out of since then i had never seen interiors until just recently and i could have lived out the rest of my life without it what a pretentious ponderous and painfully boring piece of 70s wine and cheese tripe woody allen is one of my favorite directors but interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career in the unmistakable style of ingmar berman allen gives us a dark angular muted insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce estrangement career love nonlove halitosis whatever the film intentionally has no comic relief no music and is drenched in shadowy pathos this film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a more pronounced depth of meaning and truth but woody allen is no ingmar bergman the film is painfully slow and dull but beyond that i simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters instead i felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling whining nicotine stained martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes everyone is lost and struggling desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them its never about resolution its only about interminable introspective babble it is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audiences ability to connect woody allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out and for that reason i found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining i see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance i highly recommend this one if youre feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death otherwise lets just pretend this film never happened
2,the man from snowy river ii doesnt reinvent the wheel but is a crowdpleasing beautiful film that hits some great notesbr br for those fans wanting the elements that made the original man from snowy river film a hit breathtaking scenery sweeping score sweet romanticism and cracking action this film really delivers this story picks up a few years from the end of the first jim tom burlinson has been away gathering his fortune in a brood of stock horses he returns to pick up where he left off with his pluckish wellbred sweetheart jessica played by aussie divine lady sigrid thornton who is still attempting to break out of her corseted upbringing on her feathers cattle station harrison is now played by american brian dennehy the foil to jim and character that shakes the plot is the welltodo upper class snob alistair patton nicholas eadie who has his sights on jessica add to the mix some social tension surrounding landholdings and the stallion with a bad attitude from the first film and thats the plotbr br the best thing about this film is the acting tom burlinson fits snugly into jims wide brim hat and laconic humour sigrid thornton is a lovely heroine and the two manage some real chemistry on screen filling the solid shoes of kirk douglas was never going to be easy and brian dennehy stomps and shouts but never feels very authentic in this partbr br the music is sweeping and lush and the cinematography could be a roll from a victoria tourism reel there are moment however that feel very selfindulgent like the director wants just one more helicopter shot of the riders to show how gorgeous the landscape is without some personal human drama a little more grit would have sufficed here we are aussies we can take it there are some very jawsish moments with the stallion that defy belief however the funny thing about this film is that in amongst some glaring clichs there are some really inventive and touching scenes jim putting the saddle on the stallion very horse whisperish before its time jim and jessica setting up home the fabulous scene where jim shows up alistairs riding with his trusty whip i can see why this character is such an iconbr br altogether a very pleasing sequel heres hoping everyone involved wants to make another the man from snowy river iii the craigs im sure wed all love to see how jim and jessica are doing on their farmbr br the aussie dvd has a couple of extra scenes in it worthwhile if you are already a fan
7, spoiler br br i saw this gr8 film a few years back its a lovely story about a young fella who wants to drink his mothers milk at the breast but she thinks he is to old for it he ends up lusting after another ladies breasts and ends up in competition with his brother who fancies her throw in a jealous husband of this woman who cannot get aroused and you have a cheeky yet warm story about love friendship and lovely pairs of jugs hehebr br its brilliantbr br dont be put off by subtitles hehe
0,this movie goes beyond just being bad it is definitively the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life unless you yourself have a problem with necrophilia than you will not enjoy will not enjoy the scenes depicting it in this film if you can call it that
2,creepy  lascivious wolf the young red is wearing full makeup and extremely short shorts  robe got about 20 minutes through and realized it could be a pedophiles dream come true the upbeat music sounds a lot like something id hear at a strip club i actually think this movie is a sick joke  its not a family movie gross glad i was watching this with my daughter i dont want her to think its normal for families to view quasi kiddie porn together very bad very sad its sold as a family film joey fatone will probably be embarrassed he was in it and whats with advertising it as a special effects spectacular the effects do look low budget gawd awful
0,right at this moment i am watching this movie for the second time on television and for the second time i fell into it when it was running for an hour already i think i saw minutes more this time this movie is really impressing the way goldsworthy looks at nature changes nature in a way that you yourself would never think of really is amazing this whole movie gives you a warm feeling seeing him play with the world around him with such love or only seeing his hands covered in dirt and with broken fingernails it just touches you
6,amicus made close to a good half dozen of these horror anthologies in the 70s and this from leading horror scribe robert bloch is one of their best efforts there are four stories all worthwhile but two  sweets for the sweet and method for murder  distinguish themselves as highly effective journeys into fearbr br in sweets christopher lee plays an impatient widower whose lovely daughter chloe franks becomes resentful of his neglect and brutish intolerance so she sculpts a voodoo doll with which she expresses her distaste for his methods franks is a beautiful figure of mischievous evil and delivers one of the greatest child performances in a horror film since martin stephens in the innocents this installment is directed with great subtlety and the final outrage occurring offscreen is a moment of purest horrorbr br method of murder is about a horror novelist denholm elliott who is menaced by one of his own creations the creepy dominic this episode is striking for its simplicity and stark terror dominic may or may not be real so director peter duffell has a great time playing with our expectations the brief shots of dominic reflected in a pond or seen as a fleeting phantasm in a meadow are truly hauntingbr br the original poster art featuring a skeletal figure clasping a tray holding peter cushings severed head was a rich enticement for punters fixed on fear
6,having seen versus previously i had high hopes for alive the description of the movie on the back of the dvd jacket sounded promising alive did not deliver very slow development loads of potential with the cast and the cool visuals the premise was intriguing but the payoff did not offset the build up could have done so much more at the end most of the movie is just  sitting around  to put it plainly three of us were amped to sit down and watch this movie and by the 50 minute mark we were struggling to make it thru to the end it really needed more shock elements if you are looking for ichi the killer or versus type fights then save yourself some  and loads of disappointment
4,just another example of why stepehn kings books should not be made into movies even carrie one of the best is ruined in the adaptation from book to screen the premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer always on a diet who accidentally kills an old gypsy woman in court with the help of the judge and the local police chief he gets off even though the accident was sort of his fault as he was not paying attention as he was driving the father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the with our main character billy the lawyer getting thinner and thinner by the day though the movie kept with the book for the most part and has your typical king ending the acting was stilted and felt forced we went from one scene to the next without much of anything in between sort of like reading acts in a play king himself made a cameo in the movie sort of like dave barry which reinforces my belief that authors should stay just that authors leave the acting to actors not that anyone in this movie was that great ive seen the major characters in movies where they were much better
0,this film wasnt programmed in italian cinemasi have seen it at a manifestation called fantafestivali find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and theres no suspence in the film music is completely out of the story and i dont have words to describe the visual effectsif you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting but a few minutes later it becomes busythe story is interesting but the development needs a complete review
0,story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy a formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane violent mob by the crazy chantings of its singers unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting even those from the era should be turned off the cryptic dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third grader on a technical level its better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great vilmos zsigmond future stars sally kirkland and frederic forrest can be seen briefly
6,how tasty was my little frenchman tells a story that is alternately sad scary and lifeaffirming it ends with a brutal finale that you knew had to happen even though you were hopingmaybe even beleivingit wouldntbr br  utlimately this is the films greatest strength it expertly plays with your emotions and expectations then drops a bomb on youbr br  i saw this in a film theory class at usc back in the mid90s it is not easy to find but is definitely worth hunting for
7,a routine mysterythriller concerning a killer that lurks in the swamps during the early days of television this one was shown so often when dad would say whats on tv tonight and wed tell him strangler of the swamp hed pack us off to the movies we went to the movies a lot in those days
0,this movie must have been the absolute worst movie i have ever seen my sister and her boyfriend went to rent zodiac 2007 and got this one by accident thought it was a joke before the actual movie this was terrible i was waiting for it to get scary and it never did this movie had not actual facts about the real zodiac killer the filmmakers clearly didnt even bother to research anything on the killings they only liked the name so they decided to write a script about nothing true to its name i am upset i didnt realize it wasnt the movie sooner i try to like something out of every movie i dont hate movies ever except this one if you could have given it no stars i definitely would have out of 10
3,in the wake of lock stock and two smoking barrels the british film industry rapidly became swamped with bad gangster films in the late 90searly 00s that seem even more desperate today than they did then in one of the alltime great cases of pearlsfromswine the producers of rancid aluminium brazenly plastered the quote the best film of the century from one review all over the ads while omitting the rest of the sentence pointing out that that was only because at the time of writing it was the only film that had been released in 2000 looking at it today its hard to imagine how it ever got made uniting a cast that was briefly considered the cream of cool britannias lads mags brigade  rhys ifans sadie frost nick moran and joseph fiennes  but now merely a guarantee of a turkey every time in a confused adaptation of a confused james hawes novel that the plot is never explained could be down to the possibility that noone really knows what it is or perhaps simply dont think it matters something to do with ifans businessman being set up with steven berkoffs homicidal russian crime lord in a moneylaundering or investment scheme its never clear which because noone ever asks by fiennes crooked irish accountant who expects the russians to kill off ifans so he can take over his failing company things get increasingly confused and underexplained from there on ifans alternates between shouting about how terrible his life is while juggling visits to the fertility clinic and sleeping with his secretary and tara fitzgeralds ludicrously accented russian temptress berkoff keeps on saying bizniss and francis drake and fiennes does a decent irish accent while proving that just because he played a great writer in shakespeare in love doesnt mean hes any judge of good writing when it comes to film scriptsbr br when the most convincing performances come from keith allen and dani behr you know a film is in deep trouble with poland standing in for a russia filled with people with polish accents and a strange score that veers from john barry pastiche to lounge music to ennio morricone spaghetti western on a stylophone budget it fails completely in the cool stakes its aiming for and ends up in a curious overplotted but almost plot less limbo all its own sitting there like a joke shop dog turd
1,summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to whats the hottest movie of the week given 999 of the screens dedicated to screening it ok so i may exaggerate on the percentage but you get my drift besides stuff from hollywood bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters and from some of the trailers shown im hyped to watch them too tashan was billed as one of the most highly anticipated for 2008 but i was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas when i watched jodha akbar it was a full house but it wasnt for tashanbr br after watching it i knew why it was entertaining but it was fundamentally weak just like its literal english title which means style tashan is all style but little substance not that it doesnt have the usual star power but scenes felt forced and some bordered on a tad ridiculous even for bollywood standards i must say which is quite surprising given that tashan is directed and written by vijay krishna acharya who wrote dhoom and dhoom both of which i enjoyed tremendously br br in his rookie directorial outing with tashan while you cant fault his direction youd probably scratch your head over the plot which was clunky at best it tried to force too many things into the story though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation but that came a little too late and only toward the finale which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a thai action movie with hong kongs wirework and hollywoods ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil and in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink you have an assortment of vehicles appearing and the one that took the cake in a dhoom homage was the jetski boat in the middle of nowherebr br at best tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters saif ali khan plays jimmy cliff a call center executive who gives english tuition only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material his playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with pooja singh kareena kapoor whos not exactly who she seems the meek and sweet natured hottie she engages jimmys services for her boss mobster bhaiyyaji anil kapoor who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken english and phrases must like how an ahbeng does it and to complete the quartet akshay kumar plays bachchan pandey an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by bhaiyyaji to hunt down jimmy and pooja when they escape with money stolen from bahiyyajis businessbr br so begins a road trip of sorts with friends who turned enemies and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on jimmy cliff is probably the most implausible of all because he goes from zero to hero executing moves that would shame rambo in absolutely no time which is quite out of character kareena kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee every character has a backstory created and i thought akshay kumars bachchan pandey was probably the best the most touching and the most fun of the lot even though his character seemed a lot like a nongreen incredible hulk with his gravitydefying leaps and power packing punches his wounds also heal automatically which impressively puts wolverine to shame and the best part is his theme song which is damn alphamale and played in rara mode each time he takes on adversariesbr br but sad to say thats the only tune that is memorable something that cheers bachchan pandeybachchanpandey for most bollywood movies i watch i will usually be able to despite the obvious language gaps emerge from screenings humming a tune or two i wasnt able to do that after tashan because the songs unfortunately just werent catchy at all usually the songdance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location that i enjoy versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain or atop jagged rocks on the beach frontbr br tashan probably didnt take itself too seriously but coming from vijay krishna acharyas story you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous and for continuity to be a little more careful as well billed as a blockbuster now i can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one despite akshay kumr stealing the show tashan could have been better on the whole
1,the author sets out on a journey of discovery of his roots in the southern tobacco industry because he believes that the completely and deservedly forgotten movie bright leaf is about an ancestor of his its not and he in fact discovers nothing of even mild interest in this absolutely silly and selfindulgent glorified home movie suitable for screening at the directors drunken family reunions but certainly not for commercial  or even noncommercial release a good reminder of why most independent films are not picked up by major studios  because they are boring irrelevant and of no interest to anyone but the director and hisher immediate circles avoid at all costs
0,i saw this at dances with films and it was awesome i really felt for jake talk about adding insult to injury not only are your parents getting divorced but theres a monster after you br br it was both heartfelt and scary  there were several moments where the audience screamed in genuine fright it kind of reminded me of a japanese horror film except that the story was actually goodbr br and thats what separated jakes closet from the usual indy film pabulum  an excellent script with compelling characters also by mixing elements of the horror film with family drama the movie gets the best out of both genres and avoids the clichs of bothbr br if its not coming out in theaters definitely get the dvd
5,when i tell people that i review movies as a hobby the first thing they say is what do you think of suchandsuch movie there are a couple of problems here firstly there is the probable chance that ive not seen it and thus i ruin my reputation secondly i could trash the movie in question without realising that its actually their favourite lastly i could be given dvds to watch so they can judge my opinion thus i find myself sat before the convent which is the sort of film i would ignore completely given the choice but unable to avoid here mores the pity because this frankly dreadful horror is about as scary as a box of kittensbr br following wellworn clichs the convent focuses on a bunch of american high school students on a trip to an abandoned convent on a mission to get stoned laid and mildly spooked but youll never guess what happens next a group of cannibalistic demonic nuns emerge from the cobwebs who proceed to pick the kids off one by one in classic horror movie tradition will any of them survive and more importantly havent you got better things to worry about br br the only thing that saves the convent from being a total waste of time is the fact that nobody is really taking this tosh seriously with the exception of coolios bizarre cameo as a hyperactive cop with an itchy trigger finger its far too amusing to be properly frightening  the zombie cheerleader who makes chipmunk noises for no reason the dayglo paint jobs that appears when you become a zombie  but what really kills it as a horror is the fact that you can instantly tell when someone is going to jump out and get messily murdered but even if they were trying i still doubt that it would work  demonic nuns wearing the sort of makeup youd see in the buffy the vampire slayer tv show arent really that scary the scariest thing about this movie really is that over 10 of voters gave this a maximum score i mean i know its funny but i hardly split my sides to be honest ive had more fun in a dentistbr br the convent isnt really a horror movie as such its more of a comedy horror like scary movie or shaun of the dead but youre laughing at it instead of with it i honestly cant recommend this to anybody except the family of the cast and crew but even then i doubt very much theyd enjoy it i dont enjoy the so bad that its good genre  i personally feel that if the filmmakers cant be bothered to salvage a turkey then i shouldnt bust a gut trying to watch it yes its a bad film and yes they really should have gone home and done something more constructive a rubiks cube for example the dvd box has two price stickers  one for 499 and a reduced price of but it was sold for and that should tell you everything you need to know about this poxy cheap awesomely bad flick sorry if you do like it but the convent really is a pile of unholy crap
3,exactly what you would expect from a bmovie deritive gratuitous nudity boring in parts ridiculous gore and cheesy specialeffects of course it could have been better better acted defintly better written directed etc but then i guess it wouldnt have been a b movie the actors pretty much sucked in fact this pretty much seemed like an episode of buffy the vampire slayer or something except with a lot of blood profanity and nuditybr br tiffany shepis must be singled out she absolutely is the scream queen of the new millennium not that acting really matters in these movies but she was better than any of the other actors shes also smokin hot in that plastic jump suit thing she wore for the whole movie  wow her posterior is absolutely stunning in that outfit i mean it every single time she turns around you can help but check her out and near then end of the film the viewer is rewarded with seeing her completely nekkedbr br so if your a looser bmovie horror buff like myself check this out if not you should probably avoid at all costs
7,this show is about three little girls dj stephanie and michelle their mother is killed by a drunk driver so their father danny invites his brotherinlaw jesse and his old friendjoey so the whole show is about living life the girls go through lifes troubles and have life lessons they develop crushes boyfriends and many more the whole show is basically about to go with the flow you do not have to hold grudges you just have to let it go i think this show is really good and fun to watch i grew up watching this show and still watch it today i am glad they still air this show on television i watch it almost every day i rate it 1010
0,following the appalling attack force chances were that seagal could only have a step up with flight of fury to outstink attack force would take some doing flight of fury is a marked improvement overall but still in the grand scheme of thinks mediocre mediocrity is seemingly an achievement for seagal these days a sad insight into his movie careers decline where attack force was a hodgepodge of plot lines altered drastically from conception to filming to post production flight of fury keeps the plot line more simple someone steals a hightech stealth fighter planning to use it to fire chemical weapons which we later bizarrely discover will destroy the whole world in 48 hrs seagal has to get the plane back its that simple no annoying subplots and conspiracies weighing the film down like far too many of his recent works thats not to suddenly say the storytelling is good though its pretty poor the introduction to side characters is badly done for examplebr br in filmic terms fof is bad its badly acted by all involved and seagal looks bored to tears almost hes just got the look of a toddler whos been forced to perform the school nativity against his will and so performs with a constant grimace and air of half assedness can we blame seagal though when the material is so unambitious and cruddy not really this is the final film of his castel studios multipicture deal the producers cant be bothered to make anything remotely good promising a 12 or so million dollar budget and after seagals obligatory million probably pocketing a nice hefty chunk of it themselves if the film was made for the remaining million then im elvis pressley so in that respect why should seagal put the effort into a film thats already got distribution sorted before its made fans though may argue he at least owes them the effort hes seriously looking jaded and the continued use of stand ins and dubovers is further indication of this michael keusch directs with some efficiency while the cinematography is quite good but in all technical areas and as usual with castel a bog standard stunt team theres nothing more than mediocrity and nothing to help the film rise above its material and bored leading man again theres a few action scenes focusing on characters other than seagal which in all truth we dont want to seebr br overall the action isnt too bad its nice and violent and on occasion were treated to a few vintage nasty seagal beatings but overall nothing special partly due to a poor stunt crew and the lack of time to film anything too complex or exciting for me shadow man was a more enjoyable film because while ignoring the incoherent jumbled plot line there were more vintage seagal moments and more of him in centre stage he never disappeared for long periods during the film seagal disappears bizarrely during one action scene here and reappears after with little explanation theres far too much stock footage used using stock shots isnt an entirely horrendous thing but using it as a crutch is were treated to countless establishing shots of naval ships all the time which get annoying plus the continuity of the stock footage is all over the place just check the backdrops chopping and changingbr br the film is just middle of the road it says it all that the films best scene is a completely needless and gratuitous girl on girl scene with two hot chicks seagal even perks up briefly then too overall this may be one of the better stock footage based actioners out there but thats not saying much at all this will please many fans but they should bear in mind seagal himself would probably want to forget this ones existence 
0,hi i consider just cause one of my favorite sean connerys movies it is a tense psychological thriller with excellent performances from the cast especially conneryit also has one of the best lines i have seen in movies so the dialog is pretty good in this one it also has one of the best scenes in movies ever when sean interviews ed harriss character in prison is just fantastici enjoyed this one a lot and i can not recommend this enough really do not miss this one  do not pay attention to the negative reviews stating that the last 30 minutes suck it was as intense as the rest of the movie i really find just cause a very entertaining movie
5,i had the misfortune to see this film at a showing in the us having reluctantly sat through the entire abysmal thing i am shocked to have seen so many good reviews here on imdb br br the original film was a turkey but an interesting one it fitted into that early seventies post 1969 revolution thing this film just stinks of  well nothing really its that badbr br imagine a badly done perfume commercial  see what i mean br br madonna never could act and has been an embarrassment on the big screen for years she looks worse and worse with every one of those years increasingly coming to resemble a skinned meerkatbr br guy ritchie who has built his reputation on lock stock could never direct either  his movies are shallow badly cut fashion shows he doesnt disappoint here either he wisely cast his wife as the star of this debaclebr br please people take little heed of the good reviews this movie has received from other posters below they are quite obviously business plantsbr br dont encourage ritchie to humiliate himself further by giving him moneybr br 
0,the godfather part i was a stunning look inside the fictional corleone family and how an innocent young man was all but forced into circumstances he never wanted to have a part of the godfather part ii shows that young mans acceptance of his new role his desensitization of character as well as his complete loss of all innocence as he dives deeper and deeper into a life of crime the first two parts of this saga of this transformation of michael corleone make for one of the greatest tragedies in cinematic historybr br then along came the godfather part iii michael corleone is now the aging don of the corleone family he shows remorse for his previous actions not through subtle behaviors but by trying to use his powers for good and admitting all his wrongdoings and regrets to others very cliche and uncharacteristic of the complex character that is michael corleone michaels plans to use his powers for good are derailed by an ambitious young disciple and his enemies michaels daughter is eventually a casualty of the ongoing mob wars and her death predictably leads to michael realizing that his entire life as don has been worthless for he has failed in the one thing that was the reason for putting himself into the position he was in protecting his familybr br the godfather part ii ends with michael corleone reaching the lowest of the lows having his own brother killed before part iii was made the godfather saga was an emotionally riveting tale of an innocent young mans journey into darkness with the unbelievably tragic end of michael forgetting his roots and abandoning the one thing that has always mattered most to him and those around him family loyalty part iii paints the picture of michael as a man who is and always has been just a victim of circumstance this greatly corrupts the meaning of the first two filmsbr br the godfather part iii is a horrible mess of a film that never should have been made the only solution to the problem that is this final installment of the godfather movies is to pretend that it does not exist and that the saga actually ends with michaels shockingly horrible act of having a member of his own family killed
2,this tender beautifully crafted production delved deep down bitter sweet into my being the irreverent pupils the life embittered bus driver and the teachers personalities present a subliminal debate as the story unveils the adult characters all seem familiar my teachers my bus driver each one of their opinions so plausible and well known when a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a circuit of viewpoints all the time the babble of teenage energy is only just kept under control by the organisers of the trip mr harvey is experiencing much pain throughout  he reminds me of war damaged teachers i did not understand when i was an irreverent pupilbr br rhidian brook and the producers deserve much acclaim for this well shaped british film the acting unblemished the scenes appropriate it should be widely available yet does not seem to have been given the right opportunity
6,yes mtv there really is a way to market daria what started as a clever teenage angstcomment on everything that sucks and make the viewer feel better about their sucky teenage life sitcom now mutated into a how you should deal with your problemscharade i used to watch daria all the time and loved it now sitting here after watching the so called movie i can only wonder what the point of this all was daria tells us how to lead out life in college excuse me didnt the point daria made every episode that what you like to do is ok as long as it is ok with yourself no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks of it this entire thing reminded me of the scene in reality bites the movie channel shows the documentry for the first time
3,soldier is not as bad as many have made it out to be i found the film to have some of the sacarstic cynical humour like that in paul verhovens starship troopers the lack of dialogue and over the top action is deliberate and adds to the comicbook atmospherebr br one particular triviabit stands out for me  todd has the names of several spacewar campaigns tattood onto his chest and one of these battles is tannhauser gate for the oblivious ones out there tannhauser gate is mentioned in roy battys elegiac last lines in blade runner to imagine that todd could have fought alongside android troops like roy is mind boggling to say the least maybe script writer david peoples was nostalgicbr br ill give this one out of
5,this movie is more like a music video kusturica said in an interview from 2004 that when he is making movies he feels like making music and when he is making music he feels like making movies the best thing in promise me this is the music written by stribor kusturicabr br kusturica said in the same interview that for him the dialogues in the movies are like noise promise me this has very little noisebr br i liked life is a miracle it was also like music video for the first 30 minutes and at some points later but it had a beautiful plot promise me this has no plot i was awaiting this movie with big expectations because ive read that the script has been written by ranko bozic  one of my favourite scriptwriters who participated also in life is a miracle ranko bozic writes great dialogues but for kusturica they are noise and much to my regret i saw only two dialogues which i could identify as written by ranko bozic the other part of the script was used by the director for making his chaotic music video for the music of his son striborbr br gordan mihic the man who wrote the scripts for time of the gypsies and black cat white cat said in an interview that kusturica never follows the script black cat white cat was the only script for which kusturica said that he will not touch it according to gordan mihic after all kusturica comes back to the script and if he doesnt he doesnt make a good movie and i think this is the case with promise me this he should have followed the script of ranko bozicbr br promise me this is billed as a comedy but there are very few moments which made me laugh the comedic moments are in the same style as black cat white cat but are not that funny at all i think the difference comes from the fact that black cat white cat was written by gordan mihicbr br however i know some people who liked promise me this they find it very positive movie
7,in frank sinatras first three films he was purely a speciality act ostensibly playing himself he merely shows up to croon a song during a nightclub sequence in somebody elses movie in his fourth film the very enjoyable higher and higher young blue eyes transitions into an acting career by playing an actual role  a task made easier because hes playing himself in a fictional story that gives him a chance to croon a few numbersbr br sinatras entrance is quite funny michele morgan hears a knock at the door and asks whos there from outside a hobokentoned voice answers frank sinatra sure enoughbr br the opening credits of higher and higher may confuse some viewers as the names of songwriters rodgers and hart are prominently displayed in fact they only contributed one song to this musical disgustingly rich which this cast manage to toss off as a sort of intro to an entirely different song im a debutante interestingly that rodgers  hart song  one of their weakest  is perhaps the least enjoyable song in this movies score several others are lively uptempo numbers notably its a most important affair when it comes to love youre on your own and i saw you firstbr br sinatras good in this movie but he would do better work and sing better material elsewhere the real merits of higher and higher are the delightful turns by some performers who rarely made films paul and grace hartman were an extremely popular husbandwife dance team who starred in several broadway revues genuinely graceful ballroom dancers they put plenty of physical comedy into their dance material here grace does a high kick that knocks a shoe out of pauls hands grace hartman who died of cancer at age 48 did almost no film work so its a real pleasure that this film gives us a rare chance to see her closeup to hear her beautiful singing voice and to notice how sexy she looks in her maids uniform after grace hartmans death her husband had a long career as a character actor just occasionally dancing solo or alongside ken berry in one memorable episode of mayberry rfdbr br also quite attractive in a maids uniform here in higher and higher is the vivacious teenage singer marcy mcguire why didnt this talented girl make more movies perhaps she was just a bit too similar in personality to betty hutton i enjoy huttons performances but i like marcy mcguire even better near the end of higher and higher theres an amusing bit of physical business featuring mcguire and mary wickes as waitresses taking it in turns to move from table to table in a nightclub the alternating strides of short mcguire and tall gawky wickes are hilarious regrettably although leon errol plays a large role in higher and higher he is given almost no comedy business not once does he do his famous rubberlegged dance jack haley despite his prominent billing is also wastedbr br very wellrepresented here is dooley wilson inevitably remembered as sam from casablanca in that film wilson did his own singing but faked his keyboard performance of as time goes by in real life wilson couldnt play piano here in higher and higher he sings pleasingly and gives some amusing reactions to the other players less enjoyable is mel odious i mean mel torme victor borge gives a rare film performance here handling his dialogue deftly but never doing any of the keyboard comedy which he later did successfully in his stage showsbr br the plot forget it higher and higher is nobodys idea of a great musical but its an enjoyable delight and ill rate it out of 10 director tim whelan who worked in britain as well as in hollywood deserves to be much better known
0,the dereks have over the 1980s produced a few decent bids to acquire the title worst movie of all time and this is probably their prime achievement in these stakes in fact this film can be regarded as belonging to the so bad its good category right up there with the products of the likes of edward wood jr or doris wishman this explains the imdb voting pattern for this film with some people handing out top marksbr br anthony quinn made the odd dodgy film in his time but this performance as a randy ghost is so incredibly bad it has to be seen to be believed
1,well you know the rest this has to be the worst movie ive seen in a long long time i can only imagine that stephanie beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this rolebr br the lead role is played by to me a complete unknown and i would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkeybr br bruce lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70s and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques this movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts however even this cant disguise the fact that the lady doesnt know how to throw a punch an average year old boy would take her apart on this showingbr br sorry the only mystery on show here is how this didnt win the golden raspberry for its year
0,when i saw that this film was only 80 minutes long i thought we were in trouble condensing the gigantic w somerset maugham novel down to a movie that clocks in at under an hour and a half seemed like a disaster waiting to happen but you know the movies not half bad and it even manages to retain much of what makes the book resonate so much with its readersbr br ive heard many film buffs complain that leslie howard was a wet noodle of an actor and he was but i cant think of anyone more suited to play the role of philip carey than a wet noodle for thats certainly what carey is howard plays him well which means you want to shake him and slap him upside the head repeatedly then finally take him out and buy him a spinebr br ah and then theres bette as the girl with whom carey is obsessed and who brings his world crashing down around him i didnt know what on earth the appeal of mildred was in the book and the movie stays true to that detail but as played by davis she does become the most fascinating character in the story and if shes nasty and unlikable shes at least the most dynamic person on screen at any given time daviss performance here is credited with changing the course of screen acting much as brandos would do nearly 20 years later when he screamed out stella in that littleknown tennesee williams play and its not hard to see why davis is intense to the point of scary she makes no effort to wring any sympathy from the audience and she allows herself to look ugly and most unglamorous her appearance when carey walks in on her late in the film to find her dead or nearly dead of an unnamed disease though not much care is taken to hide the fact that its an std is shocking of course it helps that this movie squeaked out just before the production code went into effect if it had been made a year later you can bet things would have been a bit differentbr br yes much of the novel and many of its most interesting parts are left on the cutting room floor and the story really does become about carey and mildred and not much else i found that to be the least interesting and most tedious part of maughams novel but it is the part that gives the novel its title and seems to be the part that readers are still drawn to now so it strikes me as a wise decision on the part of the film makers that they chose to adapt the novel the way they didbr br grade b
2,you do realize that youve been watching the exact same show for eight years right i could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers coexist on an island but youd think that after watching unkempt stinkladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original and interestingbr br and im not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record i find questionable its just hard to suspend disbelief for bushy bill eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned makeshift biodome sipping frosty mochcinnos with moxybr br whats the appeal here i dont care about these people or their meandering lives i just dont get it but if you do find yourself being captivated by hairy unwashed people i suggest you turn off your tv and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their true habitat they call them homeless people and free of charge you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters eventually striking paydirt and fashioning a homemade dr frankensteinstyled cancerstick all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of aqua velva on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise and the best part much like survivor every week one member of the tribe leaves the island when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local institution when the frightening unmedicated state of fullblown schizophrenia kicks into gear now thats entertainment

6,a terrible film which is supposed to be an independent one it needed some dependence on somethingbr br this totally miserable film deals with the interactions among irish people were they trying to imitate the wonderful film crash if so this film crashed entirelybr br there is just too much going on here culminated by a little brat running around and throwing rocks into buses and cars which obviously cause mayhembr br the film is just too choppy to work one woman loses her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor this causes the former sister to become a bitter vetch and walk around in clothes not worth believing the older sister also becomes embittered but soon finds romancebr br then we have losers who purchase masks to rob a bank obviously the robbery goes awry but there doesnt seem to be any punishment for the crooks perhaps the punishment should have been on the writers for failure to create a cohesive film
6,this is a thinking mans silly movie if you dont expect star wars and enjoy british humor this might just turn into a cult classic for you as it has for my wife and i  from casting the voice of cary grant and jack nicholson as martians to the overly simplistic populace of big bean this is a movie that you can either sleep through or watch carefully and enjoy either waybr br its not for everyone but if you enjoy relaxing easy humor that takes a quick mind to see the joke as it slips by you will enjoy this movie

2,unlike others i refuse to call this pitiful excuse for a movie a triumph of style over substance i dont want to give style a bad name still its the most apt description that comes to mindbr br a pointless unpleasant and ultimately meaningless assault on the eyes and ears wonderland leaves one wondering only why the film was made in the first place and who in their right mind gave the greenlight to this dreary and tangled mess a biography of porn star john holmes a study of who the man was why he went into the business and how it affected him great bound to be compelling bound to be entertaining bound to be enlightening and fascinating on about a million levels and i have zero interest in pornbr br but a confusing violent rashomonstyle study of a series of murders holmes was connected with after his career ended who in hell cares what insights do we gain this film completely ignores the most interesting aspect of john holmess life  that he was a porno star wonderland might as well have been about anyone the fact that the main character is the most famous male adult film star in history is almost irrelevantbr br to make matters about a thousand times worse the picture is loaded down with jerkoff gimmicks  annoying machine gun editing sloppy dogme95 camerawork unnecessary splitscreen graphics and animation etc etcbr br in the absence of a compelling story and unique main character the director and i use the term loosely has thrown together a dozen or so techniques from other films and decided to call the resulting mess a movie among these the trendy bleachbypass look of narc or traffic or minority report the frantic often incomprehensible throwthepiecesoffilmintheair cutting style of natural born killers or 28 days later the filleverymomentofsilencewith anoldsongtoevoketheperiod soundtrack of goodfellas or blow the groovy retro title sequence of velvet goldmine or autofocus or catch me if you can the list goes on and on and on patheticbr br i wanted to like this movie i had real hopes for it wonderland avenue had been around for years had the context of the murders been emphasized rather than the murders themselves i think it could have worked had the murders and holmess growing involvement with seedy la types signaled the end of a career or the end of the swinging 70s i think the film could have had meaning it could have served a purpose as it is  meaningless pointless who cares how many perspectives exist on a series of murders generally unknown by the public the case isnt famous enough to merit such painstaking examinationbr br this film should have been the third act of the john holmes story thats it period and it could have worked whats that oh right right they didnt want to tell a traditional riseandfall story they didnt want to make boogie nights or goodfellas or star 80 or autofocus they wanted their film to be different rightbr br well in one sense they succeeded theres a big difference between those films and wonderland the difference is those films are goodbr br 
6,this movie surprised me it had good oneliners and laughs  a nonstop actionpacked storyline with tons of gun action and explosions this movie surprisingly had a lot of good twists and turns the plot is solid despite what others may think it kept my interest the whole time right up till the very end in conclusion this is a great way for an action movie buff to spend time on
2,this is film that was actually recommended to me by my dentist and am i glad he did the blend of british humor should i say humour and the reality of a lost middleaged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a hoot add to that mix the reality of what it takes to actually grow pot those plants under the bushes were not going to make it without the tlc they received and it is a truly hilarious yet touching film i laugh every time i conjure the vision of all the bar patrons sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses on counting down the lights maybe its just my mendocino county blood but the brits definitely got this one right 1010

1,have you ever heard the saying that people telegraph their intentions well in this movie the characters actions do more than telegraph future plans  they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced embeth davidtzs character is not mysterious just wooden and kenneth branagh doesnt succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to havebr br the bottom line obvious plot onenote performances unlikeable characters and grotesque southern accents employed by british actors
4,i remember the original series vividly mostly due to its unique blend of wry humor and macabre subject matter kolchak was hardbitten newsman from the ben hecht school of bigcity reporting and his gritty determination and wiseass demeanor made even the most mundane episode eminently watchable my personal fave was the spanish moss murders due to its totally original storyline a poortroubled cajun youth from louisiana bayou country takes part in a sleep research experiment for the purpose of dream analysis something goes inexplicably wrong and he literally dreams to life a swamp creature inhabiting the dark folk tales of his youth this malevolent manifestation seeks out all persons who have wronged the dreamer in his conscious state and brutally suffocates them to death kolchak investigates and uncovers this horrible truth much to the chagrin of police captain joe mad dog siskawonderfully essayed by a grumpy keenan wynnand the head sleep researcher played by second city improv founder severn darden to droll understated perfection the wickedly funny harrowing finale takes place in the chicago sewer system and is a series highlight kolchak never got any better timeless
0,this movie is just crap even though the directors claim to be part of that oiculture its still a very very bad directorial debut the topic itself is very interesting and i accept the bad acting due to the fact that they are all amateurs and never acted before but the worst thing about this film are the dialogs and very unexperienced and naive directing theres no timing at all in that movie i felt like the directors were so exited to do that movie its their first feature that they actually never really asked themselves what story they wanna tell i met ben one of the directors on several occasions and hes a nice and thoughtful guy but that doesnt make him a director i think that american history x is full of clichs but somehow manages to transport a story oiwarning is full of clichs doesnt tell anything new or provocative and thats the sad thing about this movie its far from any oirealitybr br if you wanna see weird but great german films watch the movies of michael haneke christoph schlingensief oskar roehler hans weingartner or oliver hirschbiegelbr br bennys video funny games die unberhrbare mein letzter film das experiment das weisse rauschen muxmuschenstill br br  out of ten because of the topic and the photography

7,watch the original with the same title from 1944 this made for tv movie is just godawful although it does use as far as i can tell almost the same dialog it just doesnt work is it the acting the poor directing ok so its made for tv but why watch a bad copy when you can get your hands on the superb original especially as youll be spoiled to the plot and wont enjoy the original as much as if youve watched it first br br there are a few things that are different from the original its shorter for once but all are for the worse the actors playing the parts here just dont fit the bill you just dont believe them and who could top edward g robinsons performance from the original if you want only watch it after youve seen the original and even then youll be very brave if you watch it through its almost sacrilege
3,its hard to believe that this is a sequel to henry fool hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both movies while henry fool is refreshing witty comical fay grim is slow boring and doesnt go anywhere where has the wit gone i am baffledbr br it is 10 years since i saw henry fool and many of its dialogs and scenes are still vivid in my memory fay grim is painful to watch this is no fault of the actors who are good parker posey or great jeff goldblum  the blame lies entirely with the plot the dialog and even some of the filming low budget is no excuse a huge disappointment br br sorry i couldnt pay attention to the plot i was so bored so disappointed if you enjoyed this one you might not enjoy henry fool so much the two movies have absolutely nothing to do with each other there is no continuity in the characters personalities its all a fraud to entice fans of henry fool to watch the sequelbr br im switching this off now  henry in some sort of jail with a taliban
2,in the first one it was mainly giant rats but there were some wasps and a giant chicken too this one however is just giant rats period well giant rats and one really growing little boy this one is about this growing boy and a scientist that is trying to help him so he accidentally creates giant killer ratsyou know how it is this movie has some kills and its moments but i find it to be on par with the original i just prefer some variety in my giant creature movies well that is not truei actually like empire of the ants maybe i just do not care for giant rodents all in all a rather drab movie though it does have one rather odd turn of events in this one dream sequence that is truly bizarre i just cant recommend this one
0,this one and her pilgrim soul are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of twilight zone as i mentioned in my comment on the new series theres something lacking in this new series maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned its a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than serlings version however this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too i think the appeal is that no matter what they do the lovers can never unite i remember i wasnt surprised by the korean movie il mare later remade into the lake house i think its because i saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film
5,the minion is about well a minion a servant of satan and whose goal is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped he is some sort of demon who possess human beings and when the body dies will possess another anyone who happens to be possessed will go on some berserker rage dolph lundgren plays lukas a member of a secret order of templars who is tasked to keep the key away from the minion the movie begins a thousand years ago in the middle east where a couple of knight templars flee from the minion then flash forward to 1999 where the key winds up somewhere underground in new york an archeologist is assigned to studydig the place where the key was found needless to say the minion is after the key and the movie becomes a long winded chase scene between the minion and lukas and archeologistbr br the movie is just that a low budget bmovie flick the movie lacks energy and just trods along youll follow the chase but you wont ever feel involved in the story which willfully takes ideas from previous movies especially the terminator films the fight scenes with the minion is troublesome in that you never get the sense of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is it skillfully becomes a oneman army when fighting a squad of templars but sucks when it comes to oneon one and its supposed to be around for a long time all this goes to show that any sense of logic is just thrown down the drain for convenience the whole idea of a secret order of templars a door to hell and the key isnt well explained we are merely to accept that they just exist the movie seems to have been made with the feeling theres not much potential to the story but only enough to make a few bucks dolph lundgren sure looks like he wish he were somewhere elsebr br the verdict of stars
7,greetings again from the darkness remember all the what happened to woody allen jokes even mr allen poked fun at the fans who wanted him to continue making his same funny films as with any great artist mr allens craft evolved over the years and he lost some fans while picking up others last years masterpiece matchpoint showed he is still every bit as relevant and poignant as he was in the days of annie hall and manhattan what is most striking to us 40 plus year fans is that mr new york himself seems to have a bit of a crush on the mother country apparently he actually likes england while filming matchpoint mr allen became enamored with scarlett johansson and her real life spirit and sense of humor this attraction motivated him to write his best comedy in years scarlett while risking overexposure must be given credit for not just picking films that cast her in some glamorous light she is unafraid to look and act like a real person in scoop she flashes some real on screen comedy chops and in many scenes delivers the real punchline to mr allens straight man of course any time mr allen decides to put himself in front of the camera he will get more than his share of one liners and social commentaries in  which is fine because few do it betterbr br very nice support work from ian mcshane and hugh jackman in fact mr jackman provides a few glimpses into why many of us thought him the best choice to replace brosnan as the new bond as with most of allens films the star is the script not the actors although scarlett delivers superbly here and is a nice contrast to the polished allen and jackman what makes this one crackle is the dialogue  especially the banter between allen and scarlett if you are not a huge woody the actor fan fear not he does limit his screen time and he is quite effective except in two or three brief scenes that almost seem out of place another woodman tradition is a sparkling musical background and scoop is no exception  especially the strauss compositionbr br scoop is a nice cross between annie hall and the best of the marx brothers films or the cary grant comedies yes it is an adult comedy but it is actually very cute  especially for a serial killer and talking ghost comedy
6,very nicely done movie it does stay in your memory better billed as a romance than flying or war altho the flying parts are realistic and almost error free flying buffs like myself will enjoy this movie even if attracted by the airplanes unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in lovebr br fun watching early crowe he is good and exudes charm his reading of high flight is superbbr br cheers boom
1,nicely and intelligently played by the two young girls mischa barton as frankie and ingrid uribe as hazel although the plot is rather a stretch of the imagination young hazel running for mayor seems out of place to be honestbr br while the acting is well done by all concerned the movie tends to lack a genuine atmosphere of drama perhaps weve grown to expect gritty reality in movies rather like comparing pollyanna to how green was my valley never mind each of them are good in their own waybr br i do admire joan plowright even if her role is somewhat subdued here middle of the road entertainment well suited for younger viewers and how nice at times to be exposed to fine classical music which is almost a raritybr br i find this movie to be a welcomed change as it reflects quieter thoughtful values for the growing up years and no violence thank goodness a warm family film to enjoy
0,as this happens to be one of most favorite novels  i was very excited to see the move i was not disappointed yes of course there are a few things that i could pick on  but i think that the movie stuck true to the book and was a really good movie it seems that stephen king films mostly get a bad review  but this is one of the good ones it is such a dark story  which i guess is why i like it  and what is better than the dead coming to life and something about animals returning from the grave is quite creepy too if you have seen the movie do yourself a huge favor and now read the book it is a well written screen play  the actors could have done a better job  i only say this for rachel  and ellie  she was so whinny  i liked everyone else a lot and most important to me  it stuck true with the novel
0,ok  as far as the versions of this movie there were people involved in the making  john korty and bill couterie george was just the producer  he really didnt have any kind of say so in the film  just helped with money  the adult version was made possible by bill couterie john korty didnt like or approve this version as it was done behind his back thanks to ladd films going under they didnt advertise this movie and threw all their advertising cash for the right stuff hoping it would pull them through and it didnt so this movie never really had a chance when twice made it to cable hbo  they showed the reels with bills version and john threatened to sue if it was shown anymore did you notice how the adult version wasnt on for very long showtime got the clean version the version on the videotape and laserdisc is the version approved by john who holds more power than bill its a pity really as the adult version is actually better and does make more sense but its very doubtful that it will ever be released in that version onto dvd or any other format short of bootleg sorry to disappoint everyone i know all this info as i used to be the president of the twice upon a time fan club still have numerous items from the movie  used to own a letterboxed version of the adult version but it was stolen  only have a partial hbo copy of it now stars to the adult version  to the clean version any other questions just ask
6,i saw this movie when it first came out it was an official selection for the temecula valley international film festival and i voted for it for best picturebr br justine priestley is hot as the psychotic but complex amanda this is not your ordinary psycho movie lots of interesting and original slants on the genre sort of a fatal attraction for the younger set with some great blues music mixed in as the object of amandas affection is married to an up and coming blues singer who has less time for her husband as her career takes offbr br 
1,i watched this film on the hallmark channel recently in my opinion the film started out decent enough but eventually got sourbr br the story a us soldier in afghanistan receives one of the christmas cards that a woman back in the us has sent out to troops for christmas he becomes so inspired by the christmas card that he feels it has given him a ray of hope and happiness in his life a motivation to continue on when he is given leave he goes to the very town that the woman lives in he comes across and spunky young woman and eventually finds out that she is the one that sent the christmas card he meets the family and after saving her dad a vietnam war veteran from getting hit by a car whilst crossing the street the family decides to take him in for a while we learn that he doesnt have a family back home the soldier agrees to help out the family during the christmas season by working with them at their logging company the family comes to love him and viceversa the soldier also becomes in love with the familys daughter  the woman that sent the christmas card theres only one problem she already has a serious relationship with a man that shes in love with its also a long distance relationship the boyfriend is very different from the soldier he prefers wine and trips to france over hard labor and the great outdoors the woman prefers the latter throughout the rest of the film there is a love triangle as the womans boyfriend is back in town visiting her for the season everyone in the family seems to want the daughter to be with the soldier and the mom basically wants whats best for her daughter spoiler alert the woman comes to like the soldier more and more as they have a lot in common they happen to spend a lot of time together she gradually becomes attracted to his persona then one day he kisses her and and she kisses him back now shes so confused shes in love with her boyfriend and wants to marry him someday but shes become so fond of the soldier soon enough the boyfriend who doesnt know about the kiss but is very protective of the woman and thinks the soldier has been trying to move in on her decides to propose to the woman and she accepts his plans for their marriage however are not plans that she wants she wants to be at home have kids and be close to her family he wants to travel the world go to exotic places and if they have kids he wants to take them along this doesnt sound too thrilling for the woman however the soldier feels bad about what hes done and doesnt want to make things worse so he decides to leave town despite the dads urging him to stay and be with his daughter it all comes to a head when at the christmas eve service with church we find out that the soldier hasnt left yet the boyfriend and the woman speak to each other outside and he brokenhearted basically decides to let her go and breaks up with her the film ends with the woman and the soldier getting togetherbr br things i like i like the soldier throughout much of the film hes basically nice and polite with a strong sense of doing good for others there are moments in which the family is going with church and participating in charitable causes the family hold hands and pray during an evening meal at the table the dad and mom have a longlasting and evidently healthy marriage the soldier tries to do the right thing in a situation after he did something very wrong br br things i dont like there is a very typical love triangle story in this film the soldier turns sour as he slowly and subtly moves in on the woman and then eventually kisses her when she already has a boyfriend most of the family practically applauds this behavior  the family goes with church and participates in services yet this is how they act there is some bad language br br conclusion i became disappointed as the film ran on and it got worse and worse i ended up fast forwarding the very end of the film because i had enough so the film started out decent with some few gem moments but ended up ruining itself therefore i dont recommend this film to anyone
0,the first installment of this notorious horror series presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of blackclad men who torture her for several days before finally killing hershe is beaten savagelyspun around in the chair endlesslyhas her finger nails pulledanimal guts are thrown at herhot boiling water is poured on her and finally her eyeball is punctured with a needlereally sick and nasty scenethe makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing murder on tapeof course some of the special effects are rather poor but the idea of making a snuff is pretty gruesomei have seen also flowers of flesh and blood which is more gory and sadisticbut less disturbinganywaythis one is a mustsee for horror fans
6,this mans navy is as other comments have indicated a rare and wellfilmed look at navy lighter than air lta activities the lta crews were justly proud that the convoys they shadowed never lost a ship to submarine attack and the filming at the various nas locations give a valuable glimpse at a type of aviation that is long gone however the first half of the movie is all about beery his relationship with his service pals and him meeting the tom drake character and his mother and getting drakes leg fixed only then does the second film start the second film is mostly ltas in action taking on a surfaced sub guys get killed and much damage is caused the look is fairly gritty and realistic i imagine then we shift to southeast asia did the navy have ltas there never mind this part is really wild with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle and the japs are shooting like mad shades of vietnam except the getaway is oh so leisurely this is a blimp were talking about in the end a feelgood wwii drama about a very unusual part of the war
4,in the previews the 40 yearold virgin boasts the image of another immature sex romp about a 40ish lonely guy who suddenly feels the urge to do the deed simply because he hasnt too many past bad experiences have dampened his enthusiasm to the point that he avoids women completely and then the unexpected happens he falls in love whats more theres a movie out about it and its called the 40 yearold virginbr br the virgin of the title is andy stitzer steve carell who is indeed 40 works as an employee at an electronics store and collects vintage action figures which are displayed all throughout his nice bachelor pad for all to see he has a lovely home theater system and watches survivor with his two kind elderly neighbors hes a pretty picturesque definition of the lonely guy who needs to go out more and talk to more womenbr br now heres the real novelty with this picture it does the impossible task of actually dealing with its subject matter in a cute mature fashion this is a movie that could very easily have turned out a lot differently in the hands of a more transparent team of filmmakers it could have descended into endless sex gags and jokes but thankfully this picture never stoops that low sure there are sex jokes here and there and even a few prods are aimed at the gay community which are in no way meant to be taken as gaybashing as two of the characters exchange insults towards each other while playing a video game mortal kombat deception no less  the ultimate testosteronedriven fightfest for guysbr br as someone who is rapidly approaching 20 collects mcfarlane toys action figures and has himself never done the deed i found this film amusing and touching in a way that a similarthemed movie could never have been i was able to relate to the character of andy stitzer more than anyone in the theater because i was the only teenager present at this showing everyone else looked like they were all past 40 a bit arrogant i know but would you you is italicized still be able to relate if you were the only teen present at an afternoon screening of the 40 yearold virginbr br of course andy has never had sex and wakes up everyday with morning rise dont ask and hes pressured by his buddies to try outlandish methods of gaining the attention of the opposite sex when its first discovered andy is a virgin at 40 his three buddies and fellow electronics store coworkers david paul rudd jay romany malco and cal seth rogen all at first assume hes gay because hes never been with a woman which couldnt be any further from the truth the truth is andy loves women but past traumatic experiences revealed hilariously one after the other in a flashback sequence have put him on the sidelines for goodbr br david jay and cal each embark on a mission to get andy laid so help them all but you know that such escapades will only end in disaster as proved by one date with nicky leslie mann who puts andy through the worst drunkdriving experience i think anyone would not want to go through and he has a rather creepy encounter with beth elizabeth banks the pretty girl who works in the bookstore and is eventually revealed to be a total sex fiendbr br things brighten up for andy when he meets trish catherine keener the friendly woman who works at a store across the street that sells stuff on ebay for people hmmm and with that nicelooking collection of action figures you can go figure that in the end a large financial payoff awaits him that is if he can ever do the deedbr br at last this is the sex romp weve been waiting for it deals with a very real issue a lot of lonely guys probably go through not that anything is wrong with being a virgin but lets look at the big picture how many of us lonely guys want to be a lonely guy forever the important thing were taught in this picture is that lonely guy must be himself i dont think he needs to go through body waxing like andy does which is sidesplitting to be honest and according to this website and various other news articles was in fact real and so was the blood on carells shirt afterwardbr br the 40 yearold virgin was directed by judd apatow and cowritten by himself and carell which originated as a skit that starred carell carell is sweet and human as his character is not some layabout who approaches this thing with his eyes shut this is probably one of the most intelligent romps ive ever seen and is not offensive a whole lot because its characters are treated with dignity and respect even carells buddies who pass off bad advice to cover up their own relationship insecurities can be related to on a fundamental levelbr br the way the 40 yearold virgin plays out is indeed funny in the end but ill leave that up to you the viewer to observe surely if anyone can go through the things andy does and still have the strength to attract a woman as sexy as catherine keener then its true it is never too latebr br 1010
6,every motion picture bette davis stars in is worth experiencing before davis costars with leslie howard in of human bondage shed been in over a score of movies legend has it that davis was robbed of a 1935 oscar for her performance as a cockneyspeaking waitress unwed mother  manipulative boyfrienduser mildred rogers the story goes that the afi consoled davis by awarding her 1st oscar for playing joyce heath in dangerous i imagine davis fans of of human bondage who agree with the oscarrobbing legend are going to have at my critiques contrast of the 1934 film for which the afi didnt award her performance  the 1936 film dangerous performance for which she received her 1st oscar in 1937br br ive tried to view all of bette davis motion pictures tv interviews videos advertisements for wwii  tv performances in popular series in hindsight it is easy to recognize why this film of human bondage gave davis the opportunity to be nominated for her performance she was only 25yo when the film was completed  just about to reach hollywoods red carpet the public began to notice bette davis as a star because of her performance in of human bondage that is what makes it her legendary performance but rko saw her greatness in the man who played god  borrowed her from warners to play rogersbr br im going to go with the afi in hindsight some 41 years after their astute decision to award davis her 1st best actress oscar for dangerous years later by doing so the afi may have been instrumental in bringing out the very best in one of hollywoods most talented 20th century actors because from of human bondage onward davis knew for certain that she had to reach deep inside of herself to find the performances that earned her the golden statue doubtless she deserved more than oscars perhaps as many as 6br br dangerous provides an exemplary contrast in davis depth of acting characterization for its in dangerous 1936 that she becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century davis is so good as joyce heath shes deadcenter on the red carpet whereas in of human bondage davis is right off the edge still on the sidewalk  ready to take off on the rest of her 60 year acting careerbr br perhaps by not awarding her that legendary oscar in 1935 instead of a star being born an actor was given incentive to reach beyond stardom into her soul for the gifted actors greatest workbr br it is well known that her contemporary peer adversary was joan crawford a star whose performances still dont measure up to davis even anna nicole smith was a star howard stern is a radio host star too lots of people on stage  the silver screen are stars few became great actors the key difference between them is something that bette davis could sense the difference between the desire to do great acting or to become starstruckbr br try comparing these two movies as i have viewing one right after the other maybe youll recognize what the afi  i did davis was on the verge of becoming one of the greatest actors of the 20th century at 25yo  achieved her goal by the time she was 27 she spent her next 50 plus years setting the bar so high that it has not been reached    yetbr br had the afi sent her the message that shed arrived in of human bondage davis life history as a great actor may have been led into starstruckdom instead
0,i was really impressed with this film the writing was fantastic and the characters were all rich and simple its very easy to get emotionally attached to all of them the creators of this movie really hit the nail right on the head when it comes to creating real life characters and getting the viewer sucked right into their world further the music is terrific they employed some independents to do the score and some of the soundtrack and they do a fantastic job adding to the movie if you have a chance to catch this movie in a small theater or at a film festival like i did i highly recommend that you go see it also on a personal note paget brewster is beautiful in this movie thats reason enough to go check it out
6,if you havent seen this its terrible it is pure trash i saw this about 17 years ago and im still screwed up from it
4,we start all of our reviews with the following information my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years recently we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost so we can see whatever we want whenever we want the point of this is that critics count for zero your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or nottherefore it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us we never ever listen or read the critics we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us well enough about thatbr br this movie is very good not just good but very good the critics are a bunch of morons just because there is nudity and language they hated it it was worth the price of ticket and that is all you can ask for is that not right every movie cannot be an academy award nominee sharon stone is gorgeous and does a great job in the movie and it mystifies me as to what in the hell the critics want
2,this documentary is founded on sponge cake as soon as you put any real evidence on it the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap for example bart sibrel claims they must have had multiple lighting sources because the shadows appear to be crossing if this were the case wouldnt there be two or more shadows for each object when apollo 11 went through the van allan radiation belts they spent 30 mins there not the 90 mins claimed in the documentary and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent to that of an an x raybr br seriously do some research learn what really happened dont let this pile of crap of a documentary mold your opinion of what really happened
3,my scalp still smarts from the burning coals heaped on it when i vowed i love this film bring on the coals ill walk over them as well to say again that i love bend it like beckham granted theres a lot of in spite of in that confession its a bit movieoftheweek the screenplay is on the paintbynumbers side and most troublingly the directors commentary implies that in this film beauty can be found primarily amongst the white of skinbr br the films genius is not in whats obvious to the syd fielddoctored eye character arcs themes construction its in both the surface and what lurks deep beneath but not in those layers of artistic topsoil that reviewers seem most often to scratch at powerful sometimes semiclad female bodies not simply on display but kicking the crap out of a football do a better job of naturalizing female strength and agility than lara croft or zhang ziyi will ever do these are real bodies keira knightleys excepted whose work is not to look great first and kick butt later they are working bodies whose beauty is in their movement and selfdetermination and in my book lead actress parminder nagra is one of the most gorgeous creatures ever captured on screen  not only because she can lay claim to that hackneyed adjective luminous but because her performance has an honesty and unbookish intelligence thats utterly compellingbr br the result is a film women can enjoy without feeling like theyre making a pact with the devil to do so as in chadhas bride and prejudice the relationships amongst women sizzle with a chemistry that cant be neatly slotted into the stodgy sweet valley high categories of best friends or sisters perhaps chadha is even right in her commentary to disavow the films flirtation with lesbianism bend it like beckham has an electricity that cant be reduced to the simple heterohomosexual love triangle its conventionally structured script would suggest the precise nature of its pleasure is ultimately a bit of a mystery  and is all the more seductive for itbr br oh yes and did i mention that its hilarious
4,oh my god please for the love of all that is holy do not watch this movie it it 82 minutes of my life i will never get back sure i could have stopped watching half way through but i thought it might get better it didnt anyone who actually enjoyed this movie is one seriously sick and twisted individual no wonder us australiansnew zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies everything about this movie is horrible from the acting to the editing i dont even normally write reviews on here but in this case ill make an exception i only wish someone had of warned me before i hired this catastrophe
6,i think the croc hunter is a pretty cool guy i know i wouldnt have the nerve to go even feet away from a crocbr br but everything in this movie is bad farting jokes people getting eaten and the skit about the president all make the movie one of the worst of all timebr br its a really bad film that you have to stay away from all the jokes are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid the plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is years oldbr br im surprised the croc hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this
6,king kong vs godzilla 1963 which i recall having rated bomb had been my introduction to cult director hondas work this one isnt necessarily better  its just that ive learned to be more tolerant towards such intrinsically lowbrow fare br br here we actually get two kongs for the price of one an ugly and dopeylooking giant ape and a robot variation of it which looks even worse the simian creature lives on the island of mondo  where its shown fighting a couple of other monsters and befriends a trio of humans naturally it falls for the blonde and bland heroine in fact more intriguing is a femme fatale in cahoots with the films villainous mad genius  called dr who and sporting the anemic look and cape usually associated with a vampirebr br he kidnaps king kong and hypnotizes it in order to retrieve the element x which is embedded in the icy wastes of the north pole apparently the giant ape is more impervious to radiation than its mechanical counterpart and to ensure its full cooperation who even captures its three companions the female agent then has a change of heart helps the heroes one of whom typically is a nondescript american and is killed by who kong eventually escapes and makes it to tokyo where it has a final showdown with the robot the doctor flees the ensuing mayhem in his sub  which on a request by kongs dreamgirl is summarily trashed by the giant ape
6,i really wanted to like this movie because the critics have been unkindbr br to it to say the least but it was terrible really terrible badlybr br acted a witless script cack handed direction watching this film wasbr br like watching a car crash you want to look away but you keep staringbr br because you want to see how messy its going to get well the car isbr br wrecked and there are no survivors on the plus side the cinematographybr br was nice made me want to go on holiday if only to cleanse myself frombr br this unholy
0,stargate sg1 follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named sg1 through a device called the stargate and all the surprises awaiting on the other side of the wormholebr br having seen this series sporadically for its first few seasons when it first came out i didnt know how good this series would really be 10 years after i had last seen an episode my old impression was that the series was great but my impression was far from the truth stargate sg1 is more than just a simple scifi series it is one of the most well made interesting long running exciting scifi ever produced and why because it runs on an amazing premisebr br this series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and i think it is a very good example that television as a medium with a suitable premise is able to provide something that doesnt work on the time restriction of film the sense of familiarity created by a long running series watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief and its all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the showbr br stargate sg1 kept offering great adventures throughout the 10 years but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show br br  the first few seasons perhaps up to the 4th5th focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending goauld threat br br  from the 5th to the 7th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the goauld and preventing attacks on earth after this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg1 in a place of goauldreplicatorori conflictsbr br  the 8th season is probably the most mixed one it has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments br br  the 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no jack oneil they are both good continuations although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a little weak because they seem to be about little more than sg1 and humanjaffa losing battle after battle to the oribr br basically after season exploration was pushed to the background which in many ways was a shame because of the potential and mystery each planetepisode presented on the other hand it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers werebr br even tough i believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest the feeling i have is that it could go on the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer a last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome but ultimately things are as they arebr br in the end because of the fact that i enjoyed everything its a little hard to find that it ends the big picture however the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of 10 years is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of sg1
5,i loved the first two movies but this movie was just a waste of time and money for me and the studio im still wondering why they made this horrible movie the thing with the plastic gun and with the toy car that can go into another house are ridiculous joe pesci and daniel stern in the first two movies were so funny but the terrorists in this one are so stupid and not funny believe me this movie is just a waste of time
7,this is a very intriguing short movie by david lynch and saying the name david lynch is probably enough for a lot of people this is your typical lynch short a blonde and a brunette are in a dark room the blonde has been crying the brunette is talking in a threatening way to the blonde and thats about itbr br with a lot of silent moments but with the haunting music from angelo badalamenti there is a strange form of suspense this short feels a little like mulholland dr a movie i loved and therefore i liked this one as well it is probably especially for lynch fans but there is a chance you like this
0,final justice has the great joe don baker running around texas shooting people who shoot people then hes off to malta where he shoots more people he gets locked up many times for shooting people then he gets into a gunfight with the bad guy who is dressed like a monk there is a boat chase and joe don winds up in jail again finally joe don with the help from elaine from seinfeld kill the bad guy blow up a boat or two and someone gets shot with a flare all this and a catchy theme song just like mitchell
6,joan fontaine here is entirely convincing as an amoral beauty who is entirely incapable of feeling love for anyone but herself her husband richard ney has lost all his money through a combination of his foolhardiness and her extravagance and they are reduced to living in a tiny room with little or no prospects they continue to put on the most amazing clothes and go out and socialize as if nothing were wrong he is a charming feckless but wholly amiable fellow however fontaine decides he has to go as he has outlived his usefulness so she resolves to poison him when she realizes he does not want to divorce her so that she can move on she has meanwhile had a lover patric knowles whom she decides to drop because he is not rich either she meets the aging herbert marshall who has a yacht with all the trimmings and more money than even fontaine could figure out how to spend she targets him and decides he will do nicely he is all too eager to be eaten up by the young beauty he certainly isnt very exciting and has about as much sex appeal as yesterdays omelette but fontaine is one of those gals who has eyes only for money and the man standing between her and it is transparent so that she doesnt even notice or care what he looks like she looks through him and sees what she really wants and goes for it she proceeds to poison her husband and dispatches him very neatly and satisfactorily so that everything is going well but as always happens in the movies and sometimes even in life some unexpected things begin to go wrong and the tension rises appreciably so that fontaine begins to sweat fontaine is particularly good at looking wicked and terrified and as the net begins to close in on her her rising sense of desperation is palpable and has us on the edges of our seats hysteria and fear take over from cool calculation and cunning but she finds a fall guy for her crime in the person of her cast off lover who is an innocent victim of her scheme to set him up he is condemned to death for murder because the husbands death by poison came to light unexpectedly but sir cedric hardwicke playing a grimly determined scotland yard inspector thinks there may be something amiss and begins to doubt the story and suspect fontaine he closes in on her and some of the scenes as this happens are inspired portrayals of the wildest panic but will the innocent mans life be saved before he is executed will fontaine worm her way out of this one will herbert marshall protect her to safeguard his infatuation this film is expertly directed by sam wood and the film is a really superb suspense thriller which i suppose qualifies very well for the description of a superior film noir
5,my wife and i rented this movie because some people had drawn parallels between it and office space blockbuster and imdb even had it as an also recommended selection if you liked office spacebr br now ive seen office space probably 15 or 20 times i love it its probably one of my 10 favorite movies witty humorous and featuring characters that remind me of people ive worked with over the years haiku tunnel is similar to office space in that they are both films thats where the similarity ends we sat through probably the first 50 minutes of ht giving it the benefit of the doubt hoping nay praying that it would get better it didnt we couldnt take it any more and stopped the tape thank god it was a free rental id have been ped if wed actually paid for it we should be reimbursed for having to sit through it now since we didnt see the end perhaps it miraculously comes together and redeems itself i doubt itbr br haiku tunnel is so bad its hard to believe it ever got produced the movie is so unfunny its painful just mail the friggin letters already the premise is asinine the jokes are awful we got as far as the printer doesnt work scene and had to stop we couldnt take it anymore this film is an embarrasment for josh kornbluthbr br if you are a fan of office spacedont waste your time with this turd 010
0,this is probably karisma at her best apart from zubeidaa nana patekar also gives out his best without even trying the story is very good at times but by the end seems to drag especially when shahrukh comes in the picture what really made me like it were the performances of the leads the dialog delivery as well as the story for what it was it couldve been directed better and edited the supporting case was even great including karimas mother in law even though she just had one shining moment it was great to watch herbr br the sets were also pretty good i didnt really like their portrayal of a canadian family but once they step in india its as real as it getsbr br overall i would give it a thumbs up
0,i was utterly disappointed by this movie i had read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations i expected a drama with more intense character development but that never happens in the movie danielday lewis is a good actor but not as good as some reviewers here would have us believe i tought he repeated the same set of or movements in the movie i would rate his performance out of 10br br acting out of 10 direction is out of 10 script is the worst out of 10 br br i deleted the movie from my dvr at 70 mins into the movie much better movies out there than this
7,a classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read a classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read mark twainbr br classic seems to be the word used to describe scarface brian depalmas 1983 film about opulence self surrender greed and danger among floridas drug ring people and critics and rappers for that matter deem this film an epic gangster classic or eptiome of gangster films when it is anything but it is praised for all the wrong reasons scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over but not all the praise it gets from audiences today and therefor the fine points it so poignantly makes are missed by the general publicbr br first off the film is about a cuban refugee with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness simple yes but the layers of de palmas directing genius and the great story written by oliver stone yes i know he actually wrote a real good one here play into all of it the characters are all looking for an escape as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all each character has something to offer that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film they are entwined in a world of mystique and money but all that has a price as they all learn each character thinks they are getting better chances in life when in true dramatic irony they are actually getting worse tragedy would be a better word to describe this movie all those who praise the film for its drug usage its violence its dialog totally missed the point there is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves and that is why the film works so well the devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film not to look cool or attract viewers brian de palma doesnt make movies for cult gangsters or brainless action fansbr br next on the film is an adult drama it is not a gangster film it has its share of action but the action is plotted very carefully so it has a point its not like aliens an example of a big dumb action film and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people ridiculous hogwash if this film is about that then it is about how bad it is not a promotion of it br br this being said the film is indeed a great film it has great cinematography that pulls you into the story it has a very dramatic score in true giorgio moroder style which simply could give you chills or bring you to tears the film is rather lengthy but it is a story and each moment counts the acting is terrific al pacino  enough said he can do any role that he puts his mind to and this was no exception pretty boy steven bauer as manny i didnt think much of him in other films he did but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro de palmas direction michelle pfeiffer is a true gem as elvira popping fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in grease she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye but the three true diamonds in this rough are mary elizabeth mastrontonio as tonys sister gina who when she smiles or cries we see her soul and her fresh way of living and watch it deteriorate paul shenar as alejandro sosa a drug lord who runs deeper than a river and shenar portrays him as so and miriam colom as tony and ginas torn mother these three dig the film as deep as it can go br br this reviewer learned one main thing when watching scarface for the first time always go into a film unsuspecting all the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see only knowing de palma like i do can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds so ignore the rap crap ignore the mindless violence supporters and fix yourself a glass of baileys on the rocks and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film the real scarface
0,this movie is great fun to watch if you love films of the organized crime variety those looking for a crime film starring a charismatic lead with dreams of taking over in a bad way may be slightly disappointed with the way this film stridesbr br it is a fun romp through a criminal underworld however and if you arent familiar with hong kong films then you may be pleasantly surprised by this one i was somewhat disappointed by some of the choices made storywise but overall a good crime film some things did not make sense but that seems to be the norm with films of the east br br people just randomly do things regardless of how their personalities were set up prior its a slightly annoying pattern that permeates even in this film
7,when i got this movie free from my job along with three other similar movies i watched then with very low expectations now this movie isnt bad per se you get what you pay for it is a tale of love betrayal lies sex scandal everything you want in a movie definitely not a hollywood blockbuster but for cheap thrills it is not that bad i would probably never watch this movie again in a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time or you would see it on a sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time despite the bad acting clich lines and sub par camera work i didnt have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my dvd player the story has been done many times in many movies this one is no different no better no worse br br just your average movie
4,the arrival of vast waves of white settlers in the 1800s and their conflict with the native american residents of the prairies spelled the end for the buffalo br br the commercial killers however werent the only ones shooting bison train companies offered tourist the chance to shoot buffalo from the windows of their coaches there were even buffalo killing contests buffalo bill cody killed thousands of buffalo some u s government officers even promoted the destruction of the bison herds the buffalo nation was destroyed by greed and uncontrolled hunting few visionaries are working today to rebuild the oncegreat bison herds br br the last hunt holds one of robert taylors most interesting and complex performances and for once succeeded in disregarding the theory that no audience would accept taylor as a heavy guybr br his characterization of a sadistic buffalo hunter who kills only for pleasure had its potential the will to do harm to another br br when he is joined by his fellow buffalo stalker stewart granger it is evident that these two contrasted characters with opposite ideas will clash violently very soonbr br taylors shooting spree was not limited to wild beasts he also enjoy killing indians who steal his horses he even tries to romance a beautiful squaw debra paget who shows less than generous to his needs and comfortbr br among others buffalo hunters are lloyd nolan outstanding as a drunken buffalo skinner russ tamblyn as a halfbreed and constance ford as the dancehall girl but taylor steals the show richard brooks captures in cinemascope and technicolor distant view of buffalos grazing upon the prairie as the slaughter of these noble animalsbr br the film is a terse brutish outdoor western with something to say about old western myths and a famous climax in which the bad guy freezes to death while waiting all night to gun down the hero
5,the dancing was probably the only watchable thing about this film  and even that was disappointing compared to some other films my gawdbr br to me this is the worst kind of film  one that assumes its a work of art because it has all the trappings of filmasart yes its beautifully photographed but ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film supposedly surrounds itself tango is a tease its hot it has drama its audacious  precisely what this film is not
7,i have to say from the beginning when i watched the stargate movie movie i wasnt blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie with a lot of potential though the movie wasnt as erm amazing as other sci fi movies such as star wars or aliens which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing even though im not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people i dont remember one line from either of those movies im not a big fan of wearing star wars t shirts in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you ah getting slightly off the point here well my point is that the that you dont have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end in 2006br br though i didnt like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in 1997 and let me tell you the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today i have to admit that i would never have gone into sci fi if it wasnt for stargate and my dad who actually got me into sci fi when i was like and im glad he did other wise i wouldnt have seen the brilliant shows like sg1 which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly all sci fi series and movies basically if a new sci fi series isnt better or as good as sg1 its not worth watching basically this is the best sci fi show to date and if you dont watch this then you have no idea what you are missing
1,the thing that makes this movie so scary is the way that it portrays andre and calvin as relatively normal guys these are definitely not people who want to become professional filmmakers since they goof around in front of the camera forget scripted lines etc they are only making the video as a diary to show the survivors how normal their lives were their parents just think the guys are filming for a family home video by researching other kids attacks on their schools andre and calvin learn what not to do and they inform usually in a silly this old house kind of way any potential andres and calvins who might be watching this video how to make bombs get weapons and not get caught before zero day the day of the attack
3,i think that deep down in the darkest slimiest part of their heart everyone likes jerry springer just a little bit while his show is undeniably offensive and stupid it also gives us a chance to see that relatively speaking most of us have it real good when you look at the trailer park livin dollar whiskey drinkin incest lovin people on the springer show it makes even your worst day seem like a walk in the park jerry is performing a public service and we should be grateful he ditched a political career to host the show just for usbr br what we should not be grateful for in any way is the piece of garbage movie ringmaster ringmaster shows what life is like for people who wind up being guests on the show or so they would like us to think the movie follows the prerequisite springer story line love triangles one triangle involves connie her daughter angel and her husband rusty the other involves starletta vonda and demond when the two hapless groups meet up in la their lives intertwine and collide headon all culminating in an explosive episode of the springer show its like what short cuts would be if robert altman had had a severe crack habitbr br ringmaster is true to the show as it is stupid and offensive from start to finish it also makes me very glad that i dont live in the squalor its characters do but the movie has a problem its billed as a comedy but it just isnt very funny what laughs there are to be had are few and far between maybe some people watch this and laugh nonstop if you think blow jobs and rape are funny well then i guess youre one of those folks personally i laughed two or three times and spent the rest of the movie in utter awe of the agonizing horrors of whitetrash lifebr br the jerry springer show just isnt meant to make the leap from tv to the silver screen whats funny in an hour long show less when you count commercials isnt necessarily going to be funny in a ninety minute movie movies have to tell a story and thats something else ringmaster has trouble with the story is threadbare there are so many plot holes and continuity errors that any attempt at telling a cohesive narrative is quickly put asunder and even if there werent such problems how much fun can you pull out of a story of stereotypical people in a stereotypical story even the hollywood formula couldnt make this better ringmaster is so bad it even screws up the best part of the springer show the final thought somehow even the smartest and simplest aspect of the show wound up blowing harder than the slutty women the film is built aroundbr br the worst offender in all of this is springer himself hes such a bad actor that he cant even play himself convincingly watching springer play springer is sad its like he was going for a what if woody allen played jerry springer vibe and he failed miserably he went to the trouble of producing this disaster the least he could do is try to make it just that much betterbr br not that im saying everyone else in this movie put in an award worthy performance just the opposite they all suck not so surprisingly no one in this movie went on to greatness the best any of them was did was molly hagan landing a job on a nickelodeon sitcom apparently nickelodeon has no problem with hiring a woman who starred in the most vile film of the 90s to star in a childrens program it makes you wonder what kind of things the other adults on that channel have done in their pastsbr br here are my final thoughts what we have here is a group of people with no self respect and a man with money to burn who have met and put their resources together to produce a film that shows how much they hate themselves and how little they think of the intelligence of their viewing audience should we accept people who make movies that treat us like severely braindamaged lumps of goo i say no somewhere out there in this crazy mixed up world there is a perfect movie for each of us we just have to keep looking for it until next time take care of yourselves and your loved ones and dont ever watch ringmaster
1,wes craven has been created a most successful killerthriller movies of all time after watching hes movies you will find your new fears people dont know which wes cravens thriller movie is the best because they all differentbr br in this movie lisa is terrorize by fellowtraveler he coercible her to kill and if she dont do this jack will kill her father lisa is in the huge mess because whatever she choose she will killbr br acting was unreal rachel mcadams and cillian murphy acted unbelievable good the emotions was in right choose idea and script of this movie is great toobr br sometimes it reminds a scream but he definitely better than both screams sequels togetherbr br and what can i say  this is the best killerthriller movie in 21s century yet
1,the main problem i see with this film is its score which screams with every note this is a cheapass movie theres not much more to say here the score just plain suckedbr br the second problem which i see as quite severe as well as it involves the unwinding of the plot near the end of the film one of the the money shots if you will is the dialogue between martha adrienne barbeau and the sunflower man richard ziman in which martha is revealed to be the leader of the experiment at all times during this dialogue the viewer is very much aware that she is listening to a movie dialogue in other words suspension of disbelief breaks down here the integrity of a believable dialogue between two people is sacrificed for a willynilly stuffing of information the movie makers wish to impart to the audiencebr br the third problem was the casting of adrienne barbeau while i honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her oeuvre i feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch the main point of her performance that didnt seem to mesh was the spectrum across which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost rambolike woman on a mission this aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress and one cannot place too much blame therefore upon barbeau to the degree that she fairly competently acted her part however i would only call this a moderately severe problem to the film as a wholebr br finally the film did a wonderful job in the first half building a creep factor most notably during its horror flashes i feel that the film would have benefited by more of a commitment to these flashes as a mechanism for preventing a fizzling of the creep factor in the second half of the moviebr br so whats my holistic grading of this piece id give it a solid c to b depending upon how much credit youre inclined to give the makers for producing this film on a limited budget even with two severe and two moderately severe problems the film is premised on the solid plot of the jungian side of nazi mysticism i see no problems with plot development or coherence the dialogue with the noted exception above is downright brilliant in places especially the all important keystone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie as mentioned the creep factor was well crafted if a bit fizzly in the second half and nicholas brendan who also associated produced delivered a wonderful performancebr br all in all this film is definitely worth the viewsee it with a nazi you love 
4,based on elmore leonard this is a violent and intelligent action film the story a business man is blackmailed by some criminals roy schieder does great job as the leading character and special credits got to go to john glover who plays sort of a naughty psychopath i must mention that the villains characters are very complex and interesting  something that is very rare for an action film also features some beautiful and sexy women  most notable are kelly preston as the young bate for schieders character vanity gives a very good performance and appearance as the hooker who is connected with the three blackmailers im glad to say that annmargaret still hasnt lost it  this lady is a true babe dont look at the rate of this film i really dont know what the public and some critics have against this film but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this truly gripping and underrated film you will enjoy it thats a promise recommended a
1,sam thomas cavanagh and gray heather graham are devoted siblings who share an apartment and a love of many things  ballroom dancing 1940s movie musicals and much to their surprise an attractive woman named charlie bridget moynahan historically heterosexual gray is confused by her new feelingsbr br gray matters proves to be one of the blandest films i have ever seen its dull predictable unfunny poorly acted and poorly written nothing about it felt real and everything was very cheesy also this isnt really a romantic comedy with a special twist but more of a coming out movie sue kramer tried to make the first half cute with the romantic stuff and the second half serious with the actual acceptance and coming out part unfortunately she failed miserably the first half was largely unfunny and only heather graham was able to hold it up a little then the film took an awkward tone and got all serious the serious scenes were handled poorly and all of the emotions just felt phonybr br i guess i would have enjoyed the film a little more if the relationships between the characters felt more authentic the brother and sister relationship was very weak and they didnt really appear to be that close their relationship just didnt feel very natural also the relationship between tom and bridget felt very unnatural if two people are going to get married after only knowing each other for less than a week then you would expect to see a little more excitement but the characters talked about getting married in vegas in the same manner of asking a waiter what the specials are there was a lack of excitement in the film and it was hard to get involved with the movie with such unmotivated charactersbr br the acting was mostly weak which was a bit surprising given the decent cast heather graham gave the only good performance in the movie she was funny and had a few charming scenes but its too bad that all of her costars were complete duds bridget moynahan was very weak and her performance ringed false on every level also it seemed like she was reading her lines thomas cavanagh was pretty wooden and he showed nearly no emotion the chemistry between thomas and heather was non existent and that damaged the film because their relationship felt phony i can usually rely on molly shannon to be funny in a supporting role but here she was just annoying sissy spacek had about two scenes and she was annoying in both of them finally alan cumming just had an embarrassing character and his performance wasnt very good overall gray matters is a lame film and it isnt worth watching rating 310
0,an american woman her european husband and children return to her mothers home in watch on the rhine a 1943 film based on the play by lillian hellman and starring paul lukas whom i believe is repeating his stage role here bette davis lucile watson george coulouris geraldine fitzgerald and donald woods an antifascist a worker in the underground movement many times injured and wanted by the nazis kurt muller lukas is in need of a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy motherinlaw but he finds out that there is truly no escape as one of the houseguests coulouris is suspicious as to his true identity and more than willing to sell him outbr br great performances abound in this film written very much to put forth lillian hellmans liberal point of view it was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released as the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries reach into safe american homes the movies big controversy today is that paul lukas won an oscar over humphrey bogart in casablanca humphrey bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous rick but lukas is transcendent as kurt the monologue he has about the need to kill is gutwrenching just to mention one scenebr br though this isnt what one thinks of as a bette davis movie she gives a masterful performance here as kurts loyal and loving wife sara her acting tugs at the heart and the love scenes between kurt and sara are beautiful and tenderbr br the last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions lillian hellman is not everyones cup of tea but unlike the little foxes she has written some truly sympathetic wonderful characters and a fine story given a casting and production values by warner brothers highly recommended
7,sorry did i miss something did i walk out early the first ten minutes of unusual and untrue stories had me thinking this is going to be a classic but it was all down hill from there the acting was brilliant for what its worth william h macy is fantastic and just gets better and better every film i watch him in but it never seemed to connect i was waiting for the big moment where all the stories inter connect and then suddenlyit rains frog it was if the writer said ive gone to deep how can i pull all these stories together cleverelyoh sod it ill just have it raining frogs i like clever movies i like strange movies but this was just odd and boring 410
0,this review is for the extended cut of this moviebr br i first watched dragon lord when i bought it on dvd many years ago i always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews of it to get the general ideabr br that being said ive always found the storyline a bit confusing the movie is after all a love story and it always seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a 20 minute fight scenebr br well in the extended version this is no longer so the old original version begins off with a huge barrelclimbrugbylike sequence which is the new ending sequence in the extended version the opening sequence is dragonjackie chan hanging around his house and pretending to be training and reciting whenever his father is aroundbr br other sequenced have also been shift or prolonged in the extended cut and the story makes a lot more sense when you watch it the pacing is also better and overall it just works better it feels more like a love story and doesnt leave you asking questions about why it ends so drastically and dramatically as the regular version doesbr br i suggest everyone who is a hongkong cinema or just plain jackie chan fanatic to get a hold of the extended version and watch the movie the way it was originally intendedor at least thats how i think it was intended why else would they make it and rearrange some of the scenes when i was done watching it i felt like i had watched a completely new jackie chan movie although most of the sequences were the same
0,im tired of people judging films on their historical accuracy its a movie people the writers and directors are supposed to put their own spin into the story there are a number of movies out there that arent entirely accurate with the historybraveheart wyatt earp gangs of new york geronimo an american legend the last of the mohicansall fantastic films that are mildly inaccurate historically if you want to see a few great actors do what they do best then i suggest you see this film and dont worry about the accuracy of the facts just enjoy the quality of the film the storyline and one of the greatest actors of our time
0,in the hands of a more skilled director this film would have been considered a horror masterpiece despite michael death wish winners merely passable direction the movie is interesting original and more than a little scarybr br the script bucks more than one horror clich off its back several it cant shake including chris sarandon as the heroines boyfriend who actually listens to her as she insists that eerie things are going down burgess meredith is delightful as the lovably insane neighbor eva gardner is haunting with a young beverly dangelo as her mute and disturbed lesbian lover john carradine does a heckofa job sitting in a chair and watch out for a brief cameo from an unknownatthetime chris walken this movie is creepy and creative the plot twists are lovely if a tad predictable the climax of which i will give no detail is disturbing and quite impressive again a better director could have done more with it nonetheless it is quite satisfying  at least to those with the sensibilities of seventies horrorbr br if you like modern overproduced bodycounting torturefantasy you wont like this there is almost no gore the direction is quite spartan the effects are few although theres some delightful makeup near the end  most of which actually isnt makeupbut perhaps ive said too much alreadybr br ive rated this a little higher than its quality may justify but i enjoyed it as much as any film that ive seen
6,this movie really rocks jeff wincott is terrific in the film his fighting incredible he is such a fast martial artist brigitte nielsen  matthias hues was very good mission of justice is an action packed movie that is never boring if you like fighting movies with incredible non stop action then check out mission of justice today
0,sorry for my faulty language i am no native speaker br br yes this is a movie that almost demands an overwhelming reaction personally i agree upon all those superlatives that are around but i wont use this rather sematically void way myself to describe the movie here because those perfect the oneandonly besteverreviews make some people turn away including mebr br so if you are looking for another hamlet that has the potential to rival with many theatrical and all cinematic ones  then dont miss this one if you happen to find it anywhere unfortunately not too many people will have any chance to see it it seems there is no dvd out there and the german language version  which is quite well done  is not available in any formatbr br just in case you decide to get a copy spare out that cut down two hours or so version of this movie it is no use and no fun and gives a wrong impression of a movie that deals in an interesting way with flow and architecture and its also crippled down to 43 aspect ratiobr br greetings from germany fl
6,i think this piece of garbage is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed why all the american animators thinks that the kids this days wants stupid gi joe versions of good stories the looney tunes are some of the most beloved characters in history but they werent created to be xtreme i mean come on tiny toons was a great example of how an old idea can be updated without loosing its original charm but this piece of garbage is just an example of stupid corporate decisions that only wants to create a cheap idiotic show that kids will love because hey kids loves superheroes right the whole show is only a waste of time in which we see the new versions of the looney tunes but this time in superhero form this doesnt sound too bad but the problem is that this show tries too hard to copy series like batman the animated series or the new justice league the result bad copies of flash the road runner or superman who else bugs bunny the problem is that looney tunes werent meant to be dramatic the were supposed to be funny as i said before this series sucks and many people wonders why anime is taking all over the world this show tries to be dramatic and action packed but thats something that few series and anime are able to do if you want to see a good upgrade of an old show watch tiny toons thats an example that its possible to bring back to life old characters but with a good story and respecting the original roots too bad that show is already dead another corporate wise decision i suppose
0,just imagine the real hitler who was a master of propaganda and speech would have been such a mumbling moron as carlyle portrayed him in this filmbr br nobody would have followed him not even a desperate unemployed guy in the 1920sbr br this is just a hollywood cardboard piece of propaganda itself disguised as true historybr br i pity everyone who actually believed anything from this show carlyle and the producers didnt get anything right with thisbr br why was hitler able to win so many people a whole county for his ideas if we was such a sausage why did people follow him to death by portraying him as such a loser they make their own film totally unbelievable this film is a mixture of old ww2 propaganda and mtv urban myths about one of the most important persons of the last century imagine a film about churchill where the director only shows him as a drunkard for 90 mins br br this film is a disgrace and i wonder how they could talk an actor like carlyle into this dreck
7,midnight cowboy is one of those films thats been proclaimed a masterpiece with good reason  it really is one of the finest films ever made in america its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial no wonder it was a huge success when initially released but be warned its also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made the characters are memorable welldeveloped and ultimately tragic the filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the hollywood ending something which was basically mandatory by the 80s still this is why i treasure the years of 1967 to 1977 for american film its a time when wellmade innovative and most of all bleak films could be made with the big budgets that hollywood could offer all this was over by the time star wars was releasedbr br the direction by john schlesinger makes the material work it combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects midnight cowboy has aged quite well its still as powerful now as it was when initially released the acting however is what makes this a masterpiece the characters backgrounds are never fully explained but the performances make them completely developed both jon voight and dustin hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic despite their sometimes reprehensible actions plus being a fan of vintage exploitation films i loved the scenes set on the infamously sleazy 42nd street midnight cowboy is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made 1010
6,if there is a hell it contains a screening room in which grand canyon is playing over and over again on an eternal loop one would hope that the presence of so many marvelous actors  danny glover alfre woodard kevin kline mary louise parker  would help make up for the presences of mary mcdonnell whose penance is to watch her own films for all eternity but no apparently they injected those other actors with a serum made from mcdonnell the entire affair is pretentious overblown insulting if you are deaf or know anyone who is be prepared for your blood to boil at the ludicrous tdd scene grand canyon is filled with obnoxious selfinvolved people but never gives us a reason to likeunderstandsympathize with or even tolerate them with rare exception they are insufferable losers that the gene pool would be better off without theres no plot to speak of no character development these people wont ever develop no breakout performance and the most arch writing youll ever encounter in a film the best thing about grand canyon its title this is one large hole of a movie
0,the little girl desi is so adorable i cant think of a more beautiful story then this one here it will make you cry laugh and believe knowing that this was based on a true story just made me gasp and it also made me realize that there are nice people out there great cast and an overall great movie
4,i was really surprised with this movie going in to the sneak preview knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer id seen i thought it was going to be a dude wheres my car kind of crap fest i was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because thats just how movies work instead i got a smart surprisingly original movie about a decent average guy who just never had sexbr br yes the film is chock full o sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional heylookanipple but its done much in the spirit of bad santa rather than sorority boys all the characters are people you probably know in real life redeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their livesbr br i went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap and i was very surprised yea its pretty over the top cmon its a movie about a 40 year old virgin but its very smartly donebr br in the end youre really pulling for this guy to get laid which says a lot about the movie because honestly did you really care if ashton kutcher found his car or not
3,i recently saw this at the 2009 palm springs international film this is the feature length directorial debut of veteran dutch actress monique van de ven and based on my observation it should be her last i hate movies that are so implausible that you are picking apart practically every scene this film immediately leaves you scratching your head as it begins a young photographer and his girlfriend who works for an international aid organization are having a leisurely drive through the talibancontrolled mountains afghanistan having a conversation about their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them they get out of their vehicle to watch as talliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers machine guns rifles handguns and grenades execute all five people in the truck bob waldemar torenstra starts taking pictures of all this when he is spotted by one of the insurgents who lobs a hand grenade at them that kills his girlfriend since they are with hand throwing distance they cant be more than 50 yards away yet he somehow gets away his girlfriend is blown up and he takes a picture of the moment of the grenade impact that kills her and wins a prize as photographer of the year for the photo every scene and situation in this film as as ridiculous as its opening the following year bob finds himself on assignment for national geographic on a dutch resort island where he meets kathleen sophie hilbrand and inserts himself into her seedy underworld of international drug smugglers avoid this film i would give it a 40 out of 10
4,here are some examples of pat robertsons dubiously claimed relatively good track record on predictionsbr br in his widely reported comments from the january edition of the christian broadcasting networks the 700 club during which he predicted that there would be very serious terrorist attacks and mass killing in the united states in the second half of 2007 host pat robertson boasted that he had a relatively good track record on earlier predictions but a review of robertsons 2006 new years predictions undermines that claim he predicted for example thatbr br  president bush is going to strengthen wrongbr br  the fall elections will be inconclusive but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will leave the republicans in charge wrongbr br  the war in iraq is going to come to a successful conclusion well begin withdrawing troops before the end of this year way wrongbr br further as a january associated press article reported robertson has a history of making dubious predictionsbr br the broadcaster predicted in january 2004 that president bush would easily win reelection bush won 51 of the vote that fall beating democratic sen john kerry of massachusetts wrongbr br in 2005 robertson predicted that bush would have victory after victory in his second term he said social security reform proposals would be approved wrong yet again br br he claims to speak directly with god if so god has quite the sense of humor watching pat make a fool of himself again and again
2,to say this film is simply a demonisation of catholics and a misrepresentation of history is untrue that is not what this film isbr br what this film is is a comment on the abuses of the church although this could be substituted for any powerful body the ways that this abuse affects people and families and the way so many people choose to simply allow and often participate in the abuse without thinking for themselves the fact that it is the catholic church which is in the wrong is simply because of the nature of the true story the film is based upon to label this as propaganda against catholics seems to miss the truth about what the catholic church has done at times its history is often not great and is something that films like this highlight and that needs to be highlighted yes we should comment on the abuses committed by other organisations but that is not for the remit of this filmbr br it is an amazing film which brought me to tears and well worth watching  if we do not study the past we are bound to repeat it
7,i saw the 10pm showing and i must say that this movie was nothing special although i did not leave the theater wanting my time back as i dont actually pay for movies anymore i didnt really find any redeeming qualitiesbr br there were a few lines and such that made me chuckle but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger in mind more than age as this film is rated r male audience the fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well i know you all want to hear samuel l say his infamous line but lets be honest its a whole lot of hype for very little pay off the only truly horrible part of the film was the cg which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screenbr br now i am a reasonable man i knew going into the theater that i wasnt going to be seeing casablanka and i am at least thankful that this film is an original albiet inane idea and not some remake or franchise spin off however to be honest if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months
4,i sit through movies like tiempo de valientes and i want to talk about cinema for hours the admiration this movie caused me is beyond my own limits of explanation because im watching the scenes of the film and i search inside my thoughts for filmmaking ideas and dialogue innovations that could emerge from something bigger than damian szifrons mindbr br looking the environment so uncompromised so simple im thinking this man is a genius no wonder he created what is probably the best television show argentina ever witnessed and then a first movie full of elements some contemporary directors havent still achieved el fondo del mar is the name and it awakened a few years ago my enthusiasm for our everyday cinemabr br starting his journey from peoples daily real lives szifron goes where pablo trapero never could in el bonaerense the federal police departments life traperos film was a journey into a mans mind and experiences not into the places he saw yes there was a detailed training and lots of crime situations but szifron in in there his is more of a detective story like the ones we know and love with the mysteries and the thrilling musicbr br but theres a lot of humanity in his writing and he shows us his investigation through the eyes of his main characters alfredo daz and mariano silverstein there are a lot of actors of great caliber in the film but these two actors are the ones the film cant do without the first character luis luque is a detective that has just found out his wife cheats on him and has to work on a casebr br the second one is a psychiatrist that is assigned the treatment of the detective he wants to deal with him in regular sessions but the sheriff takes advantage of the time disposition and suggests he joins daz in his routines its nothing the usual stuff no problem but it is bigger than that and it will unfold a part of the doctors personality he didnt knowbr br the relationship developed between the two leads cant be explained unless it is observed because it regards such a complexity that demonstrates how talented are some men like szifron that are trying today to leave a signature in our history reaching points of unbelievable spontaneity during a high pressure situation daz tells silverstein how do we continue our treatment and silverstein answers no im not your doctor you call me to have dinner im your friend we laugh because we cant help itbr br and we cant help laughing when daz crashes a car in the street and doesnt gives importance to it or when he trespasses all the red lights in the street or when he smokes pot in his police patrol and silverstein cant believe it but then smokes it too because hes screwed up or when silverstein tries to be friendly with dazs robber friends magic from diego peretti is what we receive there he a psychiatrist himself gives a performance in plan locas de amor but impresses with all his range luis luque on the other hand is back on track with a topnotch portrayal that reminds us the great actor he isbr br theres a passion i have for this and as i said i could write about it for hours but unfortunately thats not the way it works and i have to be precise and summarize although i have to watch a lot of the old movies and study them i could assure that tiempo de valientes is the comedy argentina had been waiting for and never gotuntil now
1,no this is not supposed to be a high budget brilliance but it is brilliant in its own right you have to look at it for what it is a low budget masterpiece involving a zombie rapist wielding a 12 inch love rod that he keeps out flapping in stride those who came to give this movie a low review were probably looking for the next cult classic or hidden gem as they say and just didnt quite get there i love how everyone points out obvious observations such as the cent baby attached to a fish pole hahaha well yes i dont think a movie with a budget like this could afford good actors or effects so they worked with what they had the guts and entrails were actually very convincing the movie was a little choppy going from sequence to sequence but overall this is one of the better movies i have seen lately that doesnt follow any trend or predictability very good for a laugh
5,earth 2009 12 big screen adaptation of the bbcdiscovery channel series planet earth offers quite a majestic sampling of nature in all its beauty with some truly jawdropping moments of how the hell did they get this footage while taking in the awesome scenics of animals in their natural habitats and environmental message of the circle of life can be cruel witness a great white shark gulping down a walrus seal as a quick meal and adorable the various babies and their rents the basso profundo tones of narrator james earl jones solidifies its gods eye views and profundity culled from literally hundreds of hours of footage the only gripe comes from the fact this should have been in the imax format and couldve even gone longer oh well theres always the next time since disney studios has produced this count on a series of more to come dirs alastair fothergill  mark linfield
1,this movie had to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen the acting was terrible horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot i will never watch this movie again nor will i recommend this movie to anyone what a waste of time first as soon as the movie began i realized what i got myself into all they did for this movie was copy scenes from many other horror movies out there and bunched them all into this one movie the prank phone calls halloween night a psycho and one knife its absolutely ridiculous i was not scared at all during the movie which i thought horror movies were supposed to do as for the making of the movie its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary i mean how do you not realize that the movies is a cheap rip off of scary movie for example at least get some good actors in there and then maybe it would have been pulled off as a good horror movie
0,ive read some terrible things about this film so i was prepared for the worst confusing muddled horribly structured while there may be merit to some of these accusations this film was nowhere near as horrific as your average dvd programmer in fact it actually had aspirations it attempted something beyond the typical monsterslasher nonsense and by god there are some interesting things going onbr br ms barbeau is a miracle to behold she carries the film squarely on her shouldersbr br this is not to say that its a masterpiece unholy ultimately collapses under the weight of its own ambition there are just too many unexplained subplots trying to coexist and the plot loopholes created by time travel are never really addressed for example if hope knows that her mother is evil and that she will ultimately kill her brother then why doesnt she just kill ma in the films very first sequence seems like it would have beat the hell out of traveling into the future to do itbr br still i give unholy points for trying a little ambition is not a bad thing
5,this movie is about this wimpy guy who decides to become a spy for a glamorous high tech company named digicorp this wimpy guy morgan jeremy northam is unhappy with his miserable suburban life and his demanding wife so he decides to become a spy he is suppose to go to conventions from other high tech companies and find out all the companies plans instead morgan finds himself attracted to a beautiful woman played by lucy liu and pretty much being doublecrossed by these two companies that force him to become a double agent how will morgan get himself out of this can he trust the beautiful but mysterious rita foster played by lucy liu and more importantly can morgan make it out alive wow what a nifty movie i was completely sucked in after 15 minutes of watching this movie it is very suspenseful and you can feel morgans fear and confusion as he is doing his best to stay alive the scene where they put this horrible contraption on morgans head to brainwash him is brilliantly creepy and frightening morgan slowly goes through a personality transformation that is not so readily apparent until you think about it after the film is finished from a wimpy guy with bad hair and glasses he turns into a man actively fighting for his lifebr br the ending wow the ending is incredible the twist is so much fun it left me gasping and cheering like crazy good performances from all around especially from jeremy natham lucy liu and nigel bennettbr br i highly recommend this film
1,as one other imdb reviewer has remarked this movie starts a bit slow but gets considerably better as it goes along yes it is released by roger corman and yes it goes over some of the same thematic ground as much higher budget predecessors such as fatal attraction and poison ivy however the juxtapositioning of the wifes career as a rising blues singer against the husbands gathering loneliness and his almost freudian need for filling the emotional and physical void or hole while shes away along with the clever use of minimal effects and settings is nicely done utilizing a very small number of locations and characters and also using water in almost every scene both as a cleansing and drowning metaphorical symbol throughout this movie though clearly suffering from a minuscule budget reminds me in many ways of the more fully realized and more recent scenario namely the french film swimming pool which it seems to me at least may have borrowed liberally some useful ideas from up against amanda with a smaller tool set up against amanda maintains its suspense with a rudimentary fatalistic view of surrendering to ones occasional lustful temptations but accomplishes this as well or better as other films in this genre the twist of the stepfather abuse of amanda in the past again very freudian is also very unique in this genre and interesting i agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction for amandas plight this aspect of the story elicits the cast is excellent i thinkbr br

0,this film is definitely a product of its times and seen in any other context it is an incredibly stupid movie heck even seen in its proper context its pretty bad mostly this is due to a silly plot and very selfindulgent direction by the famed italian director michelangelo antonioni in this case he tried to meld a very artsy style film with an antiestablishment hippie film and only succeeded in producing a bomb of gargantuan proportionsbr br the film begins with a rap session where a lot of with it students sit around saying such platitudes as power to the people and complaining about the man considering most of these hippies have parents sending them to college it seemed a bit silly for these privileged kids to be complaining so loudly and shouting revolutionary jargon a bit later violence between the students and the establishment pigs breaks out and a cop is killed our hero mark may or may not have done it but he is forced to run to avoid prosecution instead of heading to mexico or canada he does what only a total moron would dosteals an airplane and flies it to the mojave desert there he meets a happen chick and they then sit around philosophizing for hours then they have sex in one of the weirder sex scenes in cinema history as they gyrate about in the dust suddenly other couples appear from no where and there is a huge orgy scene while you see a bit of skin warranting an rrating its not as explicit as it could have been in fact it lasts so long and seems so choreographed that it just boggles the mind and of course when they are finished the many many other couples vanish into thin airbr br oddly later the couple paint the plane with some help and it looks a lot like a peter max creation despite improving the look of the plane the evil cops respond to his returning the plane by shooting the nice revolutionary when the girl finds out she goes into a semicatatonic state and the movie ends with her seemingly imagining the destruction of her own fascist pig parents and all the evil that they stand for such as hard work and responsibility instead of one simple explosion you see the same enormous house explode about times then inexplicably you see tvs refrigerators and other things explode in slow motion while dumb it is rather cool to watchsort of like when david letterman blows things up or smashes things on his showbr br aside from a dopey plot the film suffers from a strong need for a single likable character as well as extensive editing at least 15 minutes could easily be removed to speed things up a bitespecially since there really isnt all that much plot or dialog the bottom line is that this is an incredibly dumb film and i was not surprised to see it listed in the fifty worst films book by harry medved its a well deserved addition to this pantheon of crap for such a famed director to spend so much money to produce such a craptastic film is a crimebr br two final observations if you like laughing at silly hippie movies also try watching the trial of billy jack also in a case of art imitating life the lead mark frechette acted out his character in real life he died at age 27 in prison a few years after participating in an act of revolution in which he and some friends robbed a bank and killed an innocent person dang hippies

7,so often a band will get together for a reunion concert only to find that they just cant get it together not so here this concert is just shear brilliance from start to finish these three musicians obviously got together beforehand and plotted and planned what was needed to ensure this was not just a nostalgic bash to satisfy someones ego this is obvious from the start before they even step on stage many faces in the crowd werent even born when these guys first performed from the first song they capture that old magic that was cream men instruments no fuss clapton by his own admission said he had to stretch himself for this concert because there were no keyboards synthesizers etc so we get to see him at his best ginger baker demonstrates why so many drummers today speak of him as some sort of drumming guru jack bruce just great they really managed to put together a piece of magic that will stand the test of time for many years to come this ones a 10 for me

1,come on lets get real the knights of christ ordo templi or the knights templar as they are more commonly called did not even exist until the early 12th century the story is so laughable that its pathetic dolph lundgren just looked positively bored and besides if you wanted to have a reallife templar why not just use the knights of christ who are still in existence in portugal at least they should have taken history into account the only redeeming quality i could find in this movie was that the artifacts looked authentic enough to pass for medieval or gothic period pieces the acting was bad the storyline appalling the action horrible and the props were okay
2,im surprised that no one yet has mentioned that there are two versions of this same film the lions share of the footage in both is identical but here is where they differ in one version the version i have seen most often on broadcast tv the group of clerics guarding the gateway consists of the brotherhood of the protectors a fictional splinter group of priests and brothers excommunicated by the church in the other version which ive seen only once on tv the clerics guarding the gateway are depicted as priests of the official church meaning the archdiocese of new york or perhaps brooklyn also in the former version in most of the pertinent scenes the clerics are referred to as brothers and in some scenes you can see where the lips say father soandso but the dubbed audio says brother soandso in the latter version i believe everyone is referred to as fatherbr br in any event it seems that one of these two versions is more or less a partial reshooting of the other with all brotherhood of the protector scenes reshot as archdiocese scenes or vice versa kind of reminds me of the raymond burr cutaway scenes in godzilla i have videotaped both versions off broadcast tv so no im not imagining this can anyone shed some more light on the story behind these two versions of the film
6,the british horror film was in terminal decline by the start of the seventies but out of the blackness came three films that were among the best our island produced the wickerman blood on satans claw and the house that dripped blood made the future seem rosy even though a lot of people knew by this point there wasnt going to be one thtdb has the sort of cast that could easily form a wishlist if it hadnt actually been assembled in the bleak hinterland of 2008 you may well find yourself expecting to wake up waxworks is the most overlooked of the four stories and is naturally my favourite cushings life and art are interlinked so firmly that you cant tell where performance ends and pain begins one can only guess how this role affected such a gentle sensitive man death and the maiden rip peter
1,red eye is a good little thriller to watch on a saturday night intense acting great villain and unexpected actionbr br some might not want to see this movie because it goes for a very short 85 mins and 88 of the movie is on a plane and just talking dont worry they pull it off very well with the smart and witty dialogbr br a pg13 movie seems to be new grounds for director wes craven but surely enough he has fit as much violence as he possibly can into this thrillerbr br this movies strongest point is its cast this film needed good actors to deliver the dialog and thrills if they didnt have those actors the film would have been lost and boring we had rachel mcadams from mean girls and wedding crashers cillian murphy from batman begins and 28 days later rounding off this cast is brian cox from xmen 2br br the pacing in this film was great just when your thinking its going to get boring they throw a twist at you luckily this isnt a long movie and doesnt feel like it either much better then the other flight movie flight planbr br here is my flight plan comment httpwwwimdbcomtitlett0408790usercomments578br br i recommend not too long and not too shabbybr br 810
7,to call a movie like thinner bad is like calling the earth round or pauly shore untalented no news but how they got that way is what people want to knowbr br as far as this movie the book was good even if it was a little derivative of other stories from the be careful what you wish for genre burke plays an overweight lawyer who kills the daughter of a gypsy and is cursed by her father constantine from tvs room 222 to several pounds a day br br like i said it starts out good but why involve the mobster mantegna why fire automatic weapons so much why turn it into something so heavily dependent on fx i thought it would have been much more effective if it focused more on the subtle ramifications of weight loss crazes diseases death gypsy lore and such br br but no its not to be remember this is stephen king were talking aboutbr br and the ending almost the same as the book but a little too talky in fact the whole movie talks too much feeling it has to explain every plot turn to us not that i expected the dead zone but i could have done without another pet sematary thanks anywaybr br one star for at least trying to do a halfway decent makeup job however the rest of the movie is left to be say it with me thinner
4,takashi shimizu had a great opportunity with a remake of his original film juon the grudge while i havent seen that film i would have to wager that theres more imagination and originality or some ripoff originality in other words skill with known tropes of the japanese ghost movie than in his own directed remake maybe the script was written to somehow have some kind of warped appeal or i would guess accessibility for an american audience what starts off with some potential  the hint of something very screwed up going on with bill pullmans sudden movement  just goes into a total jumble and as a horror movie gimme a breakbr br tension could have been built on the situation  a nurse going to take care of a disturbed woman in a house that is haunted  but he undercuts everything he wants to get his audience to feel scares hows about some music timed just so you know when exactly to expect something a black cat yeah why not just make the ghostboy thing sound like a cat for creepiness which in effect is only creepy if you want cats plot why not just shuffle between past and present without any semblance of an actual flow of how a story could be told meaning while the flashbacks are inserted and are meant to be organic with the story overall they arent or for that matter have us care about anyone in the castbr br by the time the characters or those that are there for exposition get around to telling us what is going on or whatever theres little point to care the filmmaking is shoddy ie the 180 degree rule is broken many times over and not in a forgivable or intriguing way and the performances are wooden even when looking frightened or shocked gellar especially is disappointing but pullman who shows up later after his first scene is sorely miscast even when shimizu tries for some average old boo scares like when the woman is in the office building and chased by the grudge ghost its still silly just watch when shes going on that elevator and the ghost is in the background of shots either youll go with it and if so more power to you or youll laugh hysterically at the results count me in the latterbr br im not totally sure where this project went wrong  was it shimizu having to retool it for the studios or him not giving enough leeway with his revamp of his vision or maybe raimi had some say in it and made things more confusing andor dull than they would be with someone else the grudge gives us a lot of information that doesnt make sense or at the least give us some horrorfodder to chew on its cineplex trash of a sad order
7,i just want to make one thing clear i love michael vartan but this film really lets him down his acting is still superb hes still as charming as ever and he still looks great but the film itself is a load of rubbish natasha henstridge im sorry to say it comes over bit manly youre constantly waiting for her to run off with her best friend whos own substoryline is a little weird myself and my family who sat down and watched the film with me were also put off by the soundtrack to the film at times the music just didnt fit with what was going on in the scenes however even this was not the worst aspect of what i found to be a very disappointing film i could forgive the leading ladys butchness i could forgive the freakish characters that were thrown in to the mix and i could forgive the poor choice of musical accompaniment but whose choice was it to cut out the whole middle section of the film and skip straight to the end the ending was obviously planned from the beginning but how it gets there is left untold if youre a michael vartan fan skip this film buy yourself a poster instead
1,while it contains facts that are not widely reported it is not exactly the truth they took a lot of liberties in rearranging events excluding people and using sets that do not meet the facts of their lives in the 30s there were more than just bonnie clyde and wd in the gang at various times and those people had as much to do with the facts as those included buck and blanche went to convince clyde to go straight much earlier than the one shootout and in fact got drawn back into crime some of the events that were portrayed in daylight actually took place at night bonnies wound was much more severe and never healed right it was so bad she had to be carried around by someone until it healed up and even then it stiffened up so she walked stiffly clyde also walked with a limp because while in prison he cut off a big toe i know im being nit picky and it was a tv movie but even without these factual errors in this true story the movie moves too fast from event to event and comes across more as several separate snapshots of their lives rather than being a cohesive flowing storybr br id recommend reading a book or seeing a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth
0,it really is a shame that films like this never snag best picture nominations because this one is simply a winner this is by far the most consistently hilarious comedy i have ever seen its screenplay and design are impeccable not to mention the incredible cast i can quote this movie for hours on end watch it

4,incredible documentary captured all the frenzied chaos and misery which loomed over nyc on that fateful morning of september 11th intense personal and completely riveting 911 is perhaps the greatest documentary ever made by accident which kind of gives it an even greater appeal up until that morning filmmakers gideon and jules naudet had been following around a new york firefighter team concentrating specifically on one new recruit in a little piece they were shooting dealing with the rigorous training to become a fireman out with the team that morning filming yet another simple routine cleanup jules lifts his camera up to the sky just in time to record one of the only known images of the first plane hitting the world trade center and from there a simple documentary was no morebr br viewers are given a first hand account of what it was like to be in and around ground zero as the amazing group of firefighters and one profoundly bewildered cameraman attempt to navigate this disaster without hesitation naudet follows these automatically programmed heroes into the tower while its entire support crumbles around them the raw fear of an unknown impending doom lurks with more viability then any fictional production could ever fathom as we watch less and less become audible and visible for those trapped inside nearly as memorable is older brother gideons candid capturing of an entire city in the throngs of a larger and more palpable fear then anything they had collectively witnessed by the time we get to see the second tower collapse as the cameraman shields himself from apocalyptic debris we should all but be rinsing the dirt off ourselves from the amazingly upclose footage capturedbr br obviously the filmmakers deserve only as much credit as being in the right place at the right time to document such an extraordinary event though one can only admire the two brothers in their extraordinary adaptation to such an event in a few desperate minutes we witness them become like the firemen they document only instead of saving lives they knew they had to save footage even if it cost them their own safetybr br after viewing 911 and seeing that it came out in 2002 i feel much more resentment towards oliver stones recent rendition the big budgeted world trade center many had criticized the film for ignorantly narrowing down the focus to those two survivors trapped in rubble and although i enjoyed the movie just fine for the small and sentimental hollywood focus it brought 911 all but renders his film completely obsolete not only will this utterly gripping footage remain the only definitive collection from that day but the sublime transfer of motives midway ensures that this documentary has all the heart and character needed to never sensationalize the event again

1,this movie is about a side of ireland that americans dont normally see the narrowminded religiously prejudiced side of the friendliest race in the world the movie by the admission of the inhabitants of fethard who are old enough to remember the events is fairly accurate though they insist that the filmmakers invented some of the more violent scenes just to spice up the actionbr br the movie was very unpopular in ireland as it portrayed the catholic church in a bad light but the simple fact is that representatives of the catholic church did organise vetoes of minorities before protestants it was the jewsbr br the film is a fascinating insight into the whole issue of religion in ireland
5,this movie has always been a favorite of mine since first seeing it as a 12 year old kid in 1962 when it was shown on a los angeles television stations late show the characters are very engaging from the start of the picture and it is too bad that the movie has never been released for video tape nor is it ever shown on television apparently due to a prohibition by the estate of moss hart the playwrightproducerdirector who wrote the story and first presented it on the new york stage during wwii  the reason for denying its showing is hard to fathom more than 50 years after it was made i did not see the movie again for over 30 years when someone who had actually been a major cast member of the movie was able to get me a bootlegged copy on vhs poor video quality but good audio my memory of it was correct it was still an engaging and fascinating movie to watch an amazing aspect of this film is just how many of its stars just starting out in their careers at the time 1944 went on to became either major motion picture stars or at least wellknown and fullyemployed actors eg judy holliday edmond obrien jeanne crain barry nelson don taylor karl malden peter lind hayes george superman reeves red buttons lee j cobb kevin mccarthy and gary merrill the scenes with the b24 liberators are terrific especially the closeup shots where the details of the giant for those times 4engine bomber then 18000 manufactured now nearly extinct can be seen good insight into the different levels of training that a pilotcadet went through on his way to being assigned to a bomber crew of course very genderbiased as was the trend of the day only the men became pilots the women just supported them in their roles  hardly acceptable in todays world i hope someday it will be released onto video for a new generation to enjoy
0,this is a kind of movie that will stay with you for a long time soha ali and abhay deol both look very beautiful soha reminds you so much of her mother sharmila tagore abhay is a born actor and will rise a lot in the coming futurebr br the ending of the movie is very different from most movies in a way you are left unsatisfied but if you really think about it in real terms you realize that the only sensible ending was the ending shown in the movie otherwise it would have been gross injustice to everyone br br the movie is about a professional witness who comes across a girl waiting to get married in court her boyfriend does not show up and she ends up being helped by the witness slowly slowly over the time he falls in love for her it is not clear if she has similar feelings for him or not watch the movie for complete details br br the movie really belongs to abhay i look forward to seeing more movies from him soha is pretty but did not speak much in the movie her eyes her innocence did most of the talking
7,in my opinion this is one of the greatest movies ever made in america and it deserved every single award it won and its place on the afi top 100 list though its shamefully too low on the imdb top 250 list at only 183 as of this writing if you enjoy acting of the highest calibre voight and hoffman are a superb match welldrawn characterizations and inventive direction editing and cinematography youll love this just as much as i did schlesinger paints a vivid always credible picture of the late 60s new york city scene and its many victims struggling to overcome personal demons and survive amidst the amorality poverty and hopelessness of 42nd street new york citybr br the filmmaking techniques employed here brilliantly capture the feel of the underground new york film movement and of the city and are nothing less than dazzling ive seen many ideas including the rapidfire editing the handling of the voiceover flashbacks the drugtrip sequences and the cartoonish face slipped in during a murder scene to convey angst and terror stolen by other filmmakersbr br the relationship between joe and ratso is handled in such a way as to be viewed as an unusually strong friendship or having its homosexual underpinnings i think the director handled this in a subtle way not to cop out to the censorship of the times but rather to concentrate his energies on the importance of a strong human connection in life whether it be sexual or notbr br midnight cowboy is a brave moving film of magnitude influence and importance that has lost absolutely none of its impact over the years so if you havent seen it youre really missing out on a true american classic i recommend this film to everyonebr br score 10 out of 10
6,now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly im appalled for anyone to even think that the sopranos is not television then im afraid i dont know what the world has come to let me tell u something i started watching many tv shows like lost prison break dexter deadwood and even invasion but all of those shows lost their touch after the first season especially lost and prison break which i refuse to watch because the companies took genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season then we have the sopranos i can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season and more importantly all of its episodes there is no department that this show doesnt excel in acting nothing short of superb james gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode after i heard that hbo wanted ray liotta to play tony i felt that it wouldve been the better choice however after watching the first few episodes i knew that hbo had done a great job in casting james as tony the raw emotion he displays is superb then we have everyone else edie falco michael imperioli lorraine bracco dominic chianese whom i remembered as johnny ola in the godfather part and my personal two favourite characters tony sirico and steve van zandt paulie walnuts gualtieri and silvio dante all of these actors perform to the best quality and all giving an excellent performance in each episode then we have the story never have i been so sucked into a tv show before the story is nothing short of excellent each episode is directed superbly and the score of this show is just fantastic i feel that the sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the television and i challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show not just say its too violent or they feel that the character of tony is immoral i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day i dont think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to god i implore everyone to watch this show because believe me youll be hooked from the very first episode i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show hooked on it trust me when i say that this show is a godsend compared to the crap that comes on tv after youve watched the first season youll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates television and no tv show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is the sopranos
7,the box for to die for suckered me in  a shirtless hunky guy and the promise of some laughs and sex there was plenty of thomas arklie simon whos easy on the eyes but no laughs and little sexinessbr br the couple mark and simon have allegedly been together several years but neither character is interesting enough to care about so its hard to imagine that they care about each other the fault seems to lie in the script not the performances both actors do the best they can with what theyre given br br the ending is sappy and unaffecting well not totally unaffecting i felt relief that it was over br br if youre looking for a movie about gay relationships and aids thats funny parting glances is far better
1,this is one of the most putrid movies of the 90s i would not recommend it if you have something better to do br br this picture presents africanamericans as savage uncultured violent inarticulate reefersmoking sociopaths fudgeice cube and his posse of homies are continuously disrespectful toward others in the dorm not just the white people but asians too and are never disciplined for their actions despite all that tolerance they keep on whining and crying about the evil white oppressors who run their lives and stand in their way in fact it is fudges influence that causes remmy to bond with the skin heads to drop out of college and eventually to kill maliks girlfriendbr br the skinheads are presented as a covert group of underachievers who share a pad off campus and generally stay away from everyone else they never blast their music to annoy people nor do they taunt the police they do commit serious crime such as battery and rape yet theyre not as repulsive nor as threatening as fudge and dreadsbusta rhymes arebr br theres a lot of material in this film which almost offended me or made me giggle some of it is as follows belowbr br fudge and dreads are stated as students at the columbus university yet we never see them in class and it is completely unclear how they pay their tuition one is only left to speculate that the weed they smoke has something to do with their finances though they are students at what looks like a private university they cannot utter a single line of proper english their characters are developed only through their compulsive whining and xenophobiabr br it appears that drunken kristenkristy swanson knew exactly why drunken billy was taking her to his house she even asked him to get a rubber so that they could begin the fact that he penetrated her without a condom became a rape whilst it would be great sex only if he had one handy later kristen was assured by tarynjennifer connely that she holds no accountability in that matter and despite willfully jumping into a guys bed she wasnt ready for sexual intercourse and was viciously taken advantage of by a sexual predator then a week or so later she met and slept with an ultrasensitive dogooder who knew how to avoid raping and brought a condom the director stressed contraception thoroughlybr br this movie is complete and utter garbage that makes black people look like pricks and women look stupid and frail cole hausers acting and laurence fishburnes accent are the only reasons i can think of to watch it the writerdirector is obviously a man of limited intelligence go ahead and limit your own by watching this crap if you want but keep in mind that neurons dont grow back just follow the advice at the end and unlearn
0,michael winner is probably best known for his revengethemed films such as death wish and chatos land but he is equally gifted as a director of occult horror cinema as the sentinel of 1977 proves the sentinel which is based on a novel by john konvitz who also wrote the screenplay is a clever and immensely creepy religious chiller that no lover of occult horror should consider missing the film is obviously inspired by successful occult classics such as rosemarys baby the exorcist or the omen but as far as i am concerned it is also easily as unsettling as these more widely acclaimed films and probably even creepierbr br allison parker christina raines is a beautiful young new york model traumatized by events in her her past and not yet willing to marry her lawyer boyfriend chris sarandon allison is in search for an apartment and finds a big incredibly nice one which is also affordable in an old mansion in brooklyn the new apartment however comes along with a bunch of very strange other tenants and the sinister new neighbors soon become more than a little bothersome to alice this may not be an adequate plot synopsis but i would hate to spoil any of this films great moments so i will not give any further plot description what i will say however is that the sentinel is a very creepy and effective film that profits from a great cast as well as an often bizarre and constantly uncanny atmosphere the fact that director michael winner and writer john konnvitz also acted as producers here certainly had its influence on the outcome the film is imaginatively photographed and the eerie old brooklyn mansion is a fantastic setting for this kind of film as mentioned above the atmosphere is obscure and creepy and the film also includes several shockmoments and genuine scares the film features many sinister and eccentric characters and the cast is superb beautiful christina raines is great in her role of allison parker lovable and yet on the cusp to losing her mind chris sarandon is also very good as her boyfriend a successful lawyer and the supporting cast includes many big names such as christopher walken jeff goldblum jerry orbach beverly dangelo and tom berenger before becoming really famous the cast also includes stars like ava gardner horror icon john carradine burgess meredith and my personal favorite the great eli wallach as a cynical homicide detective ive been a great fan of director michael winner for a long time mostly for films like death wish and chatos land the sentinel is yet another great film in winners repertoire and also the proof that the man is not only a master of hardboiled revengecinema but also of atmospheric occult horror all in all the sentinel is a creepy intelligent and amazingly bizarre occult chiller that is highly recommended to all horror fans
0,i understand what this movie was trying to portray how the old are often ignored and treated like a bother which means they end up feeling unappreciated and like their lives are emptybr br i do not have a problem with this message but i just feel that it could have been put across in a way that is not so painful to watch i enjoy a good art movie but when a movie becomes too selfconsciously arty as in this case the result is often frustrating including shots of a person packing a suitcase slowly that take minutes try to make a point but just end up annoying the audiencebr br the female characters are very weak and you end up wanting to just tell them to pull it together this is a movie you feel you should enjoy or rate highly and certainly has its merits but i was just too frustrated watching it to ever recommend it to someone else it might have a deeper message than other roger michell movies for example notting hill but at least that was a movie you could enjoy watching
1,this move is slow plodding cold dark and without a plot or hope it follows that tried and true european formula that they love to subsidize that is never seen but that the critics think makes an important pointbr br the movie is valuable if nothing more than to show the huge difference in the thinking between americans and europeans regarding employment in this movie the men are still nursing their wounds from years ago and feel its the governments duty to provide them with work whereas in the us we know we have to go out there and create value for someonebr br spain never looked so backward
0,flight of fury is a shockingly dire but worst of all boring action film  i dont expect a lot from a seagal film all i expect is to be moderately entertained for 90 or so minutes with some mindless action unfortunately this doesnt even achieve that low expectation the action scenes are few and far between the plot which is totally irrelevant in these films is needlessly complicated and confusing with huge plot holes throughout the acting is truly abysmal  bordering on embarrassing with seagal and his whispering one expression performance being the best among the sorry lot of 3rd raters  i find it hard to believe that anything close to 12m was spent on this dire mess unless 11m of that 12 was seagals salary  i somehow doubt it the one moment of any interest to straight guys or gay girls is that out of seemingly nowhere two hot chicks end up in a lesbian sex scene of sorts complete with huge baps on display other than that  its mediocre stuff which is no different to many of the michael dudikoff bmovies ive enduredbr br 110
3,a young solicitor from london arthur kidd is sent to a small coastal town of crythin gifford to oversee the estate of a recently passed away widow mrs drablow while attending her funeral a mysterious lady dressed in black catches his attention supposedly drablow lived a reclusive life and locals kept pretty quiet about her after this he heads to mrs drablow mansion that can only be reached on a causeway through the swamp during low tide there he encounters the woman in black again in cemetery out back of the house and things begin to get creepy as terrifying noises start coming from the marshes now can mrs drablows belongings and listening to her recorded dairy entries help kidd figure out this gloomy mystery that the locals fear to talk aboutbr br often highly regarded amongst horror fans as being one of the most chilling ghost stories ever and i can see their point but only in doses does it draw upon tag yes from what you can gather i was left a little underwhelmed despite really liking it i was expecting goose bumps throughout the whole feature but thats probably it expecting mainly i had a similar reaction with the 1980 haunted house thriller the changeling when you hear so many good things its sometimes hard not get caught up with itbr br anyhow what the british tv presentation of the woman in black effectively does is bring out a truly oldfashion slow burn spinetingling premise driven by its moody locations disquieting atmosphere and firstrate performances subtly blankets the psychologically gripping story adapted off susan hills novel of the same name as the simple mystery authentically opens up with a depressingly tragic tone and successfully characterises its protagonist little seems to happen and can feel drawn out but the fragile randomness of it catch you off guard whenever the camera focuses on the lady in black who mostly appears as a background figure its ultimately creepy she might not appear all that much but when she does talk about unnerving that also goes for that downbeat conclusion pauline moran who plays the woman in black competently gets us nervous by just her gaunt appearance and sudden positioning a pale look and those minor mannerisms just seem to haunt you shes a spirit you dont want to cross paths with yet alone let her see you an accomplished performance by a marvelously moody adrian rawlins as the solicitor arthur kidd does hold it all together in support are solid turns by bernard hepton david daker clare holman and david ryallbr br drawing heavy on its lushly sombre rural town and foggy coastal locations adds more to the realistically eerie plight and the centre piece were everything unfolds in the forlorn timeworn victorian house that comprehensively suffocates the air with constant fear director herbert wise carefully fabricates alarming imagery that slowly covers one secretive piece at a time in a smoothly paved out rhythm of welljudged contriving instead of going out to shock us some scenes contain a distressing intensity that wont let go the sound effects are masterfully used by surrounding and disorienting the air rachel portmans harrowing musical score knows how to get under your skin during those eerie moments and then stay with youbr br this rarity madefortelevision feat is a stimulating rich and unsettling supernatural spookfest it might not share much new to the subgenre but it competently sticks to it strengths to deliver what counts in this curse
7,slashers outta starsbr br not really a very good movie but i did like the idea behind it and the the filmmakers did make it look pretty good considering the tiny budget they had to work with the movie is ostensibly an episode of a live japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed off danger zone and has three costumed creeps sent after to them to kill them the survivor if there is one wins fame and fortune everyone else just winds up dead the main drawback to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad none of the real people seem real at all the actors playing the killers are kind of fun because they are portraying cheesy and overthetop caricatures of popular modern horror movie types and thats exactly how they would be done if this was an actual show the movie pretends to be done all in one take there is one cameraman who follows the contestants around the danger zone and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera but the lights keep flickering on and off constantly to hide the cuts from one take to another i would imagine
3,i grew up in brazil and i used to visit and marvel at the beautiful coast where the movie was filmed the area is called parati and is part of the green coast of the rio de janeiro state it is some 150 miles from the rio de janeiro citybr br this movie brings back to life the world of 16th century brazil where europeans were barely starting to explore the coastline which was still in pristine state and sparsely populated by various native tribes french and portuguese fought each other for territory and for the upper hand on the brazil wood trade all the while negotiating with the natives who also fought each other for whatever reasonsbr br one french misfit a mercenary is left to die by his own compatriots but manages to escape and is kept prisoner by an allnaked native tribe while he is a slave of the chief according to the customs of the tribe he is allowed to live in relative comfort for months until the time is right for him to be killed and eaten in a ritual of revengebr br what i love about this film is that it recreates in loving detail the natives villages and their wayoflife they walked naked and were cannibals and asks us to recognize and accept the life in those times as it was in a gorgeous gardenofeden life was messy violent full of pathetic superstition and bizarre customs the europeans arrive and bring their own problems including more violence with better weapons and greed there is no romanticized noble savages or heroic explorers here it is just people trying to survive in a tough worldbr br the movie is neither unduly sympathetic nor dismissive of the natives from what i know of the subject the depiction is fairly accurate which adds an air of uniqueness to the project how many movies have you seen regarding the lives of brazilian natives and their early affairs with europeans
4,first off to get my own personal feelings out of the way let me start by saying that i hate so called comedies where every single character is written and played as being so stupid that you wounder if theyre all the result of inbreedingbr br now i will say this i did see the first three american pie movies and while they werent the most amazing movies that id ever seen they were all right and outright masterpieces compared to the three american pie presents films i still feel compelled to ask what the hell were they thinking when they made this moviebr br i also have a few other questions toobr br who thought that this was an acceptable use of studio funds and production resources br br who approved the final script and what was that person smoking when they approved it br br and lastly why did anyone think that it deserved to be released into theaters where the average cost of admission is between 10 and 15 dollars depending on where you live when it should have gone straight to the discount bin at blockbuster or wal martbr br there is so much wrong with this movie that i cant write a really comprehensive review of it because it would exceed the maximum allowed words on this forum so ill just touch on the biggest things wrong with itbr br the plot is generic uninspired and stupid and characters are all about as interesting as watching paint dry for eighty minutes but the biggest thing that i can see wrong with this movie is the actingbr br while most of the cast are talentless no namers who will probably be forgotten in a few yearsbr br the one and only big name in this movie is eugene levy who spends almost all of the time he is on screen with this knowing smirk on his face that says to the viewer i know this isnt funny and im wasting my talents but hey im getting payed for it so who cares he doesnt even try to make any of his jokes funny he really deserves better than this garbage br br as i mentioned above most of the rest of the cast are horrible even though some of them have been in some really great tv shows tyrone savage from the classic canadian series wind at my back plays a character who is so unbearable unlikeable and irritating there are things that he could teach to tropical skin diseasesthat you almost wish hed die a slow and painful death on screen christopher mcdonald ncis law  order just hangs around on screen and wastes what talent he does have by being in this filmbr br maybe the next film in this series will just be a soft core porn with a story line so they can get around the mpaa and get an r rating this movie goes all out with pointless nudity vulgarity and pointlessly offencive sexual content that it should have gotten the x rating the ratings board must have been drunk or on drugs when they reviewed this film for its rating br br its interesting that twenty five years ago when wes craven submitted a nightmare on elm street to the mpaa for a rating review they forced him to cut twenty five seconds of footage i believe that it was part of a death scene that had a silicone casting of a breast in it to avoid getting an x rating and he had no other choice but to do it or the film wouldnt have been released br br but this kind of needlessly offensive trash can get the r rating today because its all done in the name of comedy if this movie was a drama or horror film with this kind of content there would have been a huge stink over the content and it would havegotten the dreaded x ratingbr br the last thing that really annoys me is the writing this movie is written to play out like the wet dream of some twelve year old kid with an extremely overactive sexual imagination its quite juvenile and extraordinarily crass nearly every expository situation that is supposed to move the corpse that this movie calls a plot along is so telegraphed that any intelligent viewer can see it coming a mile away and and the so called characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes of stereotypes never mind the often repulsive sexual references and constant unnecessary scenes of deviant sexual behavior it feels like this film was written by some incompetent first year hack in a low rent film school script writing classbr br the long and short of it is its time to kill this series before it gets any stupider more crass and offensive this pie is filled with road apples
1,saw this movie at the rotterdam iff you may question some decisions of the maker  like choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject  but this movie sure hits you in the gut especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch hope it gets the distribution it deserves
4,i had a personal interest in this movie when i was 17 and just out of high school i got a job at 20th century fox as a member of the laborers and hod carriers union at the end of my first day sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier i was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes etc for one or two weeks when i arrived the next morning a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south toward san diego just short of there we stopped at an army base called either camp callan or camp hahn once we were bunked in we went north a few miles into camp pendleton the big marine base there on the beach we started building what was supposed to be a japanese pacific island base it took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation which included a water tank gun entrenchments sandbagged trenches and living quarters all this was at very high pay sometimes golden time which was triple our regular hourly wage our food was also first rate  prime rib at lunch etc  which was amazing because it was wartime and very hard to get good meat at homebr br once the job was finished i waited eagerly for the movie to come out which was about eight or ten months later then i waited eagerly through two hours of the movie before my handiwork finally came on screen then it was no more than three or four minutes maybe less of the movies heroes dive bombing the base and blowing it to smithereens a bit disappointing but still fun br br in spite of the disappointment i enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since i learned later that this movie was underwritten by the government and fox was paid on a cost plus basis which maybe accounts for our extravagant pay and lifestyle down there bob weverka
5,greetings again from the darkness insight into the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist how strange for most of us to see someone who must work no matter the conditions else his reason for living ceases to see goldsworthys sculptures come alive and to see his reaction to each is extremely voyeuristic this artist creates because he must  not for money or fame it is his lifeforce when you see his failures energy seems to expel from his body like a burst hot air balloon it is not the dread of beginning again it is that he takes his energy from his work watching him create just to have nature takeover and recall his work is somewhat painful but nonetheless breathtaking he discusses flow and time in the minimal dialog and there appears to be little doubt that the artist and the earth are one in the same when he says he needs the earth but it does not need him  i beg to differ only complaint is the musical score seems to slow down further a pace that is relaxing at best
4,this movie even though is about one of the most favorite topics of mexican producers producers the extreme life in our cities has a funny way to put it on the screen br br four of the more important mexican directors of the last times approach histories of our city framed in diverse literary sorts as it can be the farce or the satire which gives us a film with a over exposed topic in our country but narrated in a very different way which gives a freshness tone him br br with actors little known but that interprets of excellent way their paper each one of the directors reflect in the stories the capacity by we have been identified anywhere in the world that capacity of laugh the pains and to make celebration of the sadness perhaps to many people in our country the film not have pleased but i consider that people of other countries could find attractive and share the surrealism of the mexican

7,warning review contains mild spoilersbr br a couple of years back i managed to see the first five films in this franchise and was planning to do an overview of the whole elm st series however just two years on and i find i cant remember enough about them in order to do it  i guess they couldnt have made much of an impression from what i do recall some of the sequels  dream warriors in particular  werent as bad as is often made out though even the original was no classic generally the predictability of the premise if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams doesnt lend itself to narrative tension but while i cannot recall much of the first five films i do know they never plumbed the depths of freddys deadbr br an indication of how sick of freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the characters demise the fact that the movies conclusion is not even hidden but in fact the entire purpose for the films being goes to illustrate how vacant soulless and cynical this venture wasbr br taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain robert englunds innowayscary interpretation booms with laughter i always thought freddys mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe its like englunds crying out we know this is garbage  but youre paying to see it so whos the one laughing and im sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight was freddys appearance in the films always so rudimentary all he gets to do here is a few haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr  har  har  hars and thats it if this was the only elm st film youd ever seen you wouldnt get to know the character at all even as the character predeath in a flashback englund plays him as a boohiss pantomime villain with a slop of transatlantic ie overstated misplaced and not at all funny ironybr br acting is almost universally poor just look at how many times breckin meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language only kananga himself yaphet kotto keeps his dignity and when roseanne tom arnold and alice cooper show up you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire the script too is absolutely lousy almost wholly without merit carlos ricky dean logan opens a road map upon which the noel cowardlike freddy has wittily written youre fked when prompted for the map carlos responds well the map says were fked who wrote the screenplay oscar wildebr br or how about the scene where carlos is tortured by freddy his hearing enhanced to painful levels so freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin  a potentially fatal sound given that all sounds are magnified oddly the fact that carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect nice hearing from you carlos quips freddy hoping some better lines will come along its also worth noting that dream sleep doesnt occur instaneously so being knocked unconscious wouldnt allow instant access into freddys world though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3d finale plot logic isnt that high on the list of requirementsbr br the teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious dislikeable group in the whole series tracy lezlie deane is the only one who gets to greet freddy with shut the fk up man and a kick in the scallops and was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients freddys dead no laughs no scares no interest no funbr br

0,this movie is still an all time favorite only a pretentious humorless moron would not enjoy this wonderful film this movie feels like a slice of warm apple pie topped with french vanilla ice cream i think this is chers best work ever and her most believable performance cher has always been blessed with charisma good looks and an enviably thin figure whether you like her singing or not  who else sounds like cher cher has definitely made her mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others have come and gone she is one of the most unique artists out there its funny because who would have thought of cher as such a naturally gifted actress she is heads above the socalled movie stars of today cher is a real actor on the same level as debra winger alfre woodard holly hunter angela bassett and a few others in that she never seems to be acting she really becomes the character convincingly she has more than earned the respect of her peers and of the moviegoing publicbr br everything about moonstruck is wonderful  the characters the scenery the dialog the food i never get tired of watching this moviebr br every time single time i watch the scene where they are all sitting around the dinner table at roses house i pause the remote to see exactly what delicious food rose is serving i saw the spaghetti mushrooms i think but i cant make out whether they are eating ravioli ziti what is that main course it looks wonderful and its driving me nuts br br everybody in that family was a hardworking individual and they respected and cared about one another the grandfather wasnt pushed aside and tolerated he was a vital part of the family and he was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom he seemed to be a pretty healthy independent old codger toobr br lorettas mom wasnt just a housewife she was the glue that held the family together and was a model example of what a wife mother and home manager should aspire to be she was proud of the lifestyle she had chosen but she didnt let it define who she was high powered businessmen arent as comfortable in their skin as rose casterini was notice the saucy way she said i didnt have kids until after i was 37 it aint over til its over you got the sense that she had been the type of young woman who did exactly as she pleased and got her way without the other person realizing what had happened she was charming quick witted and very smart what a great mom br br i didnt actually like loretta right away because she seemed like a bit of a knowitall who wasnt really as adventurous and as in control of herself as she wanted others to think she could tell others about themselves and where they had gone wrong but she really didnt apply common sense to her own life she was going to marry a middleaged mamas boy simply because she wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose to her life she was more conventional than her own mom she dressed and wore her hair like a matron at a house of detention and seemed humorless and bored but underneath you sensed that she was vulnerable and lonely and had a lot of love to give the right man she would probably end up making an awesome mom toobr br i could see in the future a house full of loretta and ronnies loud screaming happy kids and rose and cosmo enjoying every minute of it
6,omg this is one of the worst films iv ever seen and iv seen a lot im a film student i dont understand why angelina jolie would be in this movie did she need the money that badly i love aj and have seen almost everything shes ever been in so i watched this tick another one off it was soo bad not even good bad just bad bad it had or funny little moments but all in all it was bad n a waste of 101 minutes i cant even say aj looked good in it because well she didnt the plot is predictable unless you r expecting a retelling of romeo and juliet then its not all round disappointing maybe if your 12 this could be a good film otherwise i really dont recommend it
6,louise brooks gives a wonderful performance in this wellmade french melodrama she plays a typist named lucienne who despite being in love with a man named andre dreams of rising above her position in life she sees opportunity in a beauty contest for miss europe but andre is furious when he discovers that shes entered then demands that she withdraw she tries to take back her entry only to discover that shes already been chosen as miss france and will now go on to the main pageantbr br this is a story of love loss and decision played out to its passionate end the movie is very energetically filmed by director augusto genina and cinema tographers rudolf mate and louis nee the filming style is more like modern movies than the hollywood flicks of the 30s and shows the different style employed by europeans there are many fast cuts and traveling shots mostly done with great skill and verve the high energy of the movies first third dwindles a bit in the middle but picks up again in the last 15 minutesbr br the performances were very good by all the principals but that of louise brooks is especially memorable louise leans heavily on her silent screen skills even though this is a talkie but because her silent style had a surprisingly contemporary understated feel she makes the transition to talkies very well the long early scene at the fair was especially poignant as louise used her remarkably expressive eyes to convey her growing sense of misery and alienation of being trapped in a life she no longer wants i doubt its ever been done betterbr br the film builds to a superb finale artfully shot powerful and stylish this is really some of the best stuff of the early days of film and the tragic storyline only underscores the greater tragedy that this is the final starring role for louise brooks she wasnt just a great beauty who looked fantastic in a swimsuit she really was a major acting talent who basically threw it all away we are all the poorer for thatbr br this movie is less well known than her german films with gw pabst but i think its a better one i think this crew is just better at storytelling than pabst and while prix de beaute may lack the deep moral complexity of the pabst films its much easier to follow and is overall a more streamlined focused piece of work and it doesnt hurt that louises singing parts are done by edith piaf eitherbr br bottom line this is a classic louise brooks film well worth looking for
2,really the tale of two cocky brothers and their respective falls from grace via drug addiction and later redemption one brother a selfproclaimed genius played by james franco is your typical sensitive but intelligent manchild the other brother is a hardworking future doctor who becomes less judgmental as he himself falls prey to addiction while dealing with the stress of living up to his familys expectations for both children not too heavy handed as drug fables are want to be and all in all a pretty realistic sketch of the family dynamics that drug problems bring about id recommend it to anyone interested in such character studies and commend james franco for his efforts in what was obviously a labor of love
2,worse than the rating it has been given this is a typical scifi movie nowadays bad to awful acting a script that is poorly written and shoddy direction from the opening scene where demille is burying his set to the end this movie is terrible in the beginning scenes this movie has moses which was charlton heston in the demille film pharoah yul brynner and nefretiri anne baxtor overlooking a boy burying a box in the sand the characters that were to represent the three aforementioned icons were awful and had to resemblance to the people they were to supposedly be the fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when someone is hurt and they are all yelling for an ambulance the screenwriter obviously is oblivious to the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert i was sorely disappointed that morena baccarin decided to do a film of such low quality
6,the novel is easily superior and the best parts of the film are direct translations from what greene wrote for instance the quiet but grim humour that breaks into the scenes with boyer and lorre or the murderedchild obsession that takes over some of the plot where the film deviates from the novel it tends to the ludicrousbr br however i dont want to suggest that the film is bad in any way it always looks the part and the story stays in the mind like a good un some of the minor characters were stock actors who could turn their hand to anythingbr br its a dreadful shame that the films not available on dvd

3,this is only a response to the yahoo who says this movie is more realistic than the classic genre defining masterpiece jaws yes brainiac great whitesand other species of shark bull blacktip oceanic whitetip tigerhave been known to populate areas where easy prey is found humans dont often make it onto that menu granted but the shark in the film was repeatedly pointed out to be exhibiting abnormal behavior its not like its never happened the odds of a killer whale destroying nearly a whole town singling out a human nemesis sinking several dozen thick hulled north atlantic fishing boats and knowing when certain people all friends of the aforementioned nemesis are close enough to the water for it to reach are so slim as to be laughable much like this turd of a jaws knockoff laughable great white sharks are also known to frequently chew on boats protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards as they look like seals from below a shark the size of bruceif you dont know look it upwould be more than capable of sinking a boat like the orcahey thats the name of the blatant ripoff were discussing as it would weigh upwards of 6000 lbs i could go on but i dont need to jaws is amazingbetter acting better effects better music better writing orca is crapblatant ripoff of jaws lousy writing abominable effects most ridiculous plot this side of an olson twins flick it doesnt take a masters from columbia university to see that watch better movies
5,it helps immensely if one is familiar with the culture and time period in which this film takes place first of all these ladies are not geisha they are oiran prostitutesin the yoshiwaratype green houses circa 1860 give or take this should help clear up some details which may be confusing to the unaware the film deals with issues of loyalty love and perhaps most importantly how people deal with adversity both their own and that of others in their immediate environment that plus the outrageous photography together with the hauntingly beautiful music make for a lovely ride just plug it in suspend your disbelief and enter their world you wont be disappointed
2,this is the worst brain damaged ultra cheap super stupid silly pointless piece of trash ive ever seen an unbelievable garbage of instant cult status among fans of the bizarre if you think that ed woods plan is bad well let me tell you looks like citizen kane compared to that one special effectsagain plan is star wars actingthor johnson is al pacino so its beyond bad really but if you are looking for that kind of incredible movies its for you im a fan of american international for so many glorious horror movies the pricecormanpoe saga and some great blaxploitation stuff but with star creatures they descend right down to the z level of course my out of 10 works in reverse if you like to watch bad movies for fun the guy playing an indian chief is great so have fun and enjoy if you can
5,i cannot accept the negative comments of other reviewers they are too critical perhaps because they are stuck in the past i would like to see a comment from someone who had never seen basic instinct perhaps someone very young  i left the cinema feeling glad that i had not been swayed by the imdb reviewers 14 hours later i am still trying to find flaws in the plot but i cannot think of anything serious my advice to everyone is see it for yourself and make up your own mindbr br it follows a similar pattern to basic instinct but the plot is less confused it still left me wondering at the end but in a more satisfactory way sharon stone is as sexy and evil as before and wears her 48 years extremely well this remains her defining role david morrisey was satisfactory even though he is no michael douglas of the supporting cast i particularly liked david thewlis as the police detective
5,well its about time i had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this seasons entries while there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries at least this episode turned out well its rather funny that director rob schmidt who only has the not bad wrong turn to his credit and writer john esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included tale of the mummy and graveyard shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season in right to die we are treated to the story of cliff and abbey at the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation abbey has caught cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back while they speak they find themselves in a car accident where cliff is left with only scratches and bruises but abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire and this is just the setup people once in the hospital cliff must decide whether or not abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes theres also a side effect too every time she flatlines abbey goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever from the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists i never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it right to die should have the right to go on living forever
3,is the only way to describe this movie about subjects that should be surefire scandal sex celebrity power kirsten dunst grins her way through her role as silent movie star marion davies like she thinks shes in legally blonde the guy who plays william randolph hearst overacts to the point where you want to reach into the screen and slap him eddie izzard is pretty good except that hes playing charlie chaplin and is about oh 125 lbs too heavy for the part hard to believe this hamfisted uneven wreck was directed by peter bogdanovich but then again he hasnt made a watchable movie in what 30 years sometimes theres just no coming back

1,intimate and specific yes a bit of a cinderella story but only after many convoluted turns earning its way deeper and deeper into antwones psyche only superficial viewing can condemn this film as superficial this is the stuff that heals nations this is one of our great national stories antwones path to emotional health encompasses a whole breadth of family history the history of slavery and its aftermath in his first directorial effort first of many i hope denzel washington confirms once again that he has a truly beautiful mind and soul
5,this movie was supposed to have depicted a ladies man bachelor who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all however i did not care for his mission to settle down because i didnt care for his character i dont understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him he had absolutely no class or charisma he shouldve at least had a way about himself that made ladies weak in the knees other than his saxophone playing but to no avail just because he is a musician does not make him sexy not to mention the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love in a span of five minutes of knowing her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous does this man have any shame whatsoever had he tidied up and stopped doing and saying stupid things he would have been more attractive as a character but alas his character was bland and boringbr br gina gershons character was unnecessarily british she couldve just as easily been an uptight outoftowner with her regular speaking voice than do a poor british accent that sometimes would fade through out the moviebr br the only two characters i cared for were the fish and frog now those two had chemistry academy nominations for both stat plot holes lack of character development horrible acting unnecessary drama clich moments what a mess of a movie
2,although it has been years i still remember the complete waste that comprises the entire plot of the movie unfortunately i came across this movie after my friends and i selected it while browsing through the new releases at blockbuster we decided to pick the movie because it was the only one we all had not seen and it sounded like it may be enjoyable although it has been quite some time since i viewed the movie i still remember the lack of plot seriously there is no true plot and complete waste of time that was spent watching the movie if you are in the video store and this film catches your eye walk on and find a better movie if you did end up seeing this movie i understand your pain 
0,i shouldnt even review this movie since its not actually a horror movie  and thus not worthy of dr cheeses attention at least its not horror in the usual sense its certainly a horrifying proposition to waste your time watching this crap thats why i turned it off after the first four hours imagine my surprise then when the clock showed that only 45 minutes had passed yep thats right in plain terms this movie is boringbr br the order had lots of flaws not all of them unique in particular it seems to me the main problem with the religious subgenre of horror films is hollywoods unwillingness to engage christianity on its own terms it is quite possible to make truly creepy films that are also orthodox just ask william peter blatty in fact without orthodoxy films like this are just an anythinggoes smorgasbord of the filmmakers usually dull and illogical imaginationsbr br think about it if someone made a movie ostensibly about say physics but not only got the basic laws of physics wrong but based the entire plot on its wrong portrayals you would soon get tired of the resulting pointless plot the same goes for these sorts of moviesbr br in other words the orderand many similar movies before it invent out of whole cloth stuff about the catholic church and about the christian faith and attempt to build a plot out of these inventions unsurprisingly the plot ends up being incoherent and stupid this movie has the added charm of being as interesting to watch as your toenails growingbr br avoid this steaming pile
0,for those who think of dame may witty as the kindly slightly batty old lady from hitchcocks the lady vanishes this movie requires an adjustment here shes anything but kindly or batty instead her son george macready is the loony one just dont give him a knife otherwise his eyes light up and no furniture cushion in the house is safe now we know what he has in mind for the trapped nina foch if he can just get out from under mothers domineering handbr br really tight little womanindanger film that keeps the suspense on high throughout the script never strays from fochs dilemma shes held prisoner in a big old gothic house on the edge of an angry sea theyre going to kill her but why her predicament makes no sense the tension mounts as she tries one escape ploy after another but even strangers seem against her we begin to feel her helplessness and mounting paranoia as the world turns away from herbr br director joseph h lewis took a big step toward cult status with this film and understandably so then too watch foch run subtly through a gamut of emotions without once going over the top witty too shines as a really intimidating matriarch who knows what she wants and how to get it if she can just keep her wacko son in line my one reservation is the climax which seems too contrived considering the timing of the events nonetheless its a good nervewracking way to spend a little over an hour courtesy columbia studios
0,hip erotic wickedly sexy  whatever its the terminator with werewolvesbr br no seriously the cop saves the girl waitress from the big monster and refers to himself as her protector the lead actor ryan alosio does a pretty good job of emulating kyle reese  theres a massacre in a police precinct  the bad guy is muscular with red eyes  and it even contains dialogue along the lines of you said it yourself he wont ever stop never the dire script comes from a firsttime screenwriter who thank god hasnt sold anything since this and its all thrown together by famously bad director richard friedmanbr br the movie opens in a strip bar always a good sign and a meanlooking biker guy bursts in for no apparent reason pursued by three cops one of them is black and shock horror hes the one who gets killed in the first five minutes the film goes downhill for the next hour or so then picks up a little with some decent action sequences before rounding it all up with an abysmal endingbr br for the most part the cast come across as competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director whos willing to settle for less if nothing else they appear to be learning how to act in this movie and alosio along with some of the supporting cast shows signs of talent darkwolf in his human form is played by gargantuan kane hodder  famous for his numerous portrayals of jason vorhees in the friday the 13th movies hes decent enough especially considering he isnt used to speaking rolesbr br its become famous amongst groups of horny teenage boys for the lesbian rooftop scene between andrea bogart and sasha williams who gets her kit off a couple of times in the grand tradition of former power rangers actresses and its unnervingly clear that the editor spent way too much time on that scene  anyway the main redeeming feature is that the physical werewolf effects are rather good and the design of the wolf isnt bad at allbut the cgi is bad just plain bad i mean seriously if you cant reach some level of realism  why bother just throw a little extra money into the makeup aside from the terrible script this movie does have its moments many of which are unintentionally funny its good for a laugh if you dont have anything better to do but just dont spend any money on it please
1,i took a chance on hardcastle and mccormick by purchasing the first seasons worth canadian release from amazon when i got it i started with the pilot and i was instantly hooked after that i rated it stars on amazon and i am rating it 10 stars here it is just that good what i liked about it were the opening and closing themes and of course stephen j cannells logo at the end of each episode but most of all the relationship between the judge and mark as they worked together to crack each case i was so hooked that i also purchased the second season as a companion and i enjoyed it equally if you do not have this excellent series on disc i believe that you should purchase it and put it in your collection
2,gorgeous barbara bach plays jennifer fast a television reporter who travels with her crew karen lamm and lois young to solvang california to cover a danish festival the problem is that their accommodations have fallen through and all hotels in town are full so they travel out of town to a remote location and take advantage of the hospitality of the seemingly friendly ernest keller a phenomenal sydney lassick wouldnt you know it ernest and meek partner virginia lelia goldoni are hiding a big secret in their cellar pitiable deformed diaperclad junior stephen furst in a remarkable performance who ultimately terrorizes the girlsbr br a deliciously unhinged lassick plays the true monster in this disturbing little horror movie it builds slowly but surely to an intense confrontation  climax delivering the horror in small doses until the final half hour the hotel and the foreboding cellar  large echoes of psycho here  are great settings most of all the perverse plot involves incest and patricide allowing the movie to take on a truly dark quality and yet it also becomes poignant as we realize junior is no onedimensionally evil bogeyman but as much a victim as the girls the final shot is especially sadbr br the unseen is a solid little horror flick worthy of discoverybr br 810
2,youve heard it said to live every moment as if its your last whether its your last day or not i beg you not to waste any part of it watching this nichole hiltz provides some nice moments of eye candy that alas stays wrapped and david deluise shows why he should stick to the small screen or dog food commercials a shallow unrealistic plot with dreadful dialogue means there is no art in the art of revengebr br 
5,theres nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets its just that some are better than others this is very poor the acting is awful the script dire and the special effects overratedbr br why does hollywood treat its audience with such contempt and why have they made a sequel
6,saw this film recently and have to say it was the worst attempt at film making i have ever had the misfortune to see what the hell was going on with coolio totally unprovoked shooting at people in distress totally uninvolving slow tedious and detached worse than spawn long live evil dead ii
7,this film is really bad no i mean really really bad tony scott is a terrible director out of all the films he has made i only like enemy of the state besides that he is one of the worse directors of all time what appalled me the most is richard kelly director of donnie darko did the screenplay to this now richard kelly is a genius in my eyes but to be involved in this makes hope he has learnt his lessonbr br now i love mickey rourkes new roles but i cant even like him in this because of the terrible story and look of it dont get me wrong i still love mickey rourke but he has made a few accidences in his time and this is one of them i dont know what to say about keira knightly i think shes a little too overrated i just cant feel for her in filmsbr br all in all this film is bad thats it 110jd seaton
7,this show is so incredibly hilarious that i couldnt stop watching the marathon on comedy central tonight despite the fact that ive seen all the episodes previously ive always regarded silverman as a huge talent and this is finally a vehicle for that talent to be enjoyed by a wide audience i watch this show and i laugh a very large percentage of the time i cant say that about many tv shows can you this show is finally something new and interesting and most importantly funny this is a show i will never miss and it is one i will buy on dvd as soon as it comes out you owe it to yourself to watch this show i predict a long run for this series and just to be clear the people who are offended by this show just dont get it perhaps they lack the intelligence to comprehend it they should stop making fools of themselves by attacking something they dont understand anyone who uses the word bigot in reference to silverman or who claims that she only aims to shock is way off the mark shes exactly the opposite just google her and youll quickly see that shes a huge proponent of civil rights etc if you dont know that shes ironically embracing all of these outrageous viewpoints you dont get it and if you dont get it do the rest of us a favor and be quiet about it so we can all enjoy the hilarity
3,i havent always been a fan but the show grew on me it wasnt until after season that i started to see the richness of the show they finally brought daniel jacksons search for his wife to an end and finally most of the goould system lords were killed by rival lords sg1 or othersbr br towards season stargate sg1 was beginning to become stale with the new writers and the close attention by produer peter deleuise the show became more and more solidbr br the characters had become stale as well colonel jack oneill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage after his son charlie was killed in a shooting accident with oneills weapon he had decided to end his own life by going to abydos in order to face off with the goould ra the character offers little growth for any actor and actor richard dean anderson chose to play him straight raising emotional barriers to protect himself only allowing his close friends inbr br amanda tapping joined the cast as captain samantha carter she was a feminist on the edge ready to battle any man who would doubt her ability to do her job though this character had little area to grow tapping has done a great job of concentrating on carters strengths she has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things carter talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently br br christopher judge joined the cast playing the alien tealc tealc was an alien called the jaffa infant goould snake like creatures would embed themselves into the jaffa until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form the jaffa would die tealc was the first prime of apophis army knowing that apophis was not a god like goould pretend he realized the genocide that their armies had wreaked on the galaxy finally having had enough he and jack oneill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people after arriving on earth he realized that earth was the planet he was looking for who would help him fight the goould christopher judge has done quite a bit with a limited character tealc is a wise warrior much of which he learned was from his teacher master bratac the show would not be complete without master bratac played by tony amandola he is also a rock in the end he became adviser to most of sg1 especially daniel jackson br br don s davil was there from the beginning playing major general george hammand davis has done an incredible job with hammond making him sympathetic and normal he does his job has a wife sons and daughters and grandchildren you can really say he is the anchor of the base simply i would die for that man if not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world he will go himself he doesnt leave anyone behindbr br i saved dr daniel jackson for last because this character i believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on in choosing shanks i dont think the producer realized how strong shanks would be and now when people talk about jackson they dont talk about spader they talk about shanks in the early years the jackson character came off as a whiner thats why i probably wasnt a fan as the seasons pasted the character became stronger this gave him confidence in the end as of season 10 the jackson character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero he still monitors the groups ethics he still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward acheaology history culture and exploration are part of his very being he is determined though a man of peace he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement br br other characters include most recently vala mal doranclaudia black and colonel cameron mitchellben browder new lead of sg1 both actors come from a series called farscape and why they were put together is any bodies guess i see little difference between mitchell and crichton farscape character blacks character is simply off the wall definitely different from her soldier like character arin soon
6,its been a while since ive watched this movie and the series but now im refreshing my memory this was a very funny movie based on the classic series johnny knoxville and seann william scott were hilarious together bo and luke duke help uncle jesse run moonshine in the general lee when boss hogg forces the dukes off their farm bo and luke sneak around hoggs local construction site and find samples of coal they soon realize that boss hogg is gonna stripmine hazzard county unless the dukes can stop him with the help of their beautiful cousin daisy my only two problems with the movie was that burt reynolds wasnt right for the part of boss hogg and sheriff rosco p coltrane was way too serious other than that i highly recommend the dukes of hazzard
1,this 1991 nbctv movie aired six months before john goodmans bigscreen version of the life of babe ruth came out for my money there is no comparison between the two the tv production isnt perfect but it presents the babes story with more depth and complexity than goodmans onedimensional telling i especially enjoyed the films depiction of the complex lovehate relationship ruth had with yankee manager miller huggins who always understood his star players brilliance and also kept trying to point out why ruths own character flaws would never let him become a manager or leader of players the tvmovie rightly notes how ruth never fulfilled his dream of managing the yankees because of his flaws while the horrible goodman version tries to push the falsehood that ruth was denied what should have been his for the takingbr br this film makes a great companion piece to eight men out since the story starts with ruths arrival in new york in 1920 one year after the black sox scandal and when his home run exploits literally saved baseball from ruin indeed the continuity between the two films is even accentuated with john anderson reprising his eight men out role as commissioner kenesaw mountain landis
0,joe buck jon voight decides hes going to leave his small life in texas and make it big in the big city the women are there for the asking and the men are mainly tuttifruttis wideeyed he comes to new york city not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences one worse than the other in the middle of that chaos he meets and befriends rico ratso rizzo dustin hoffmann a homelesslooking man who lives in an apparently condemned buildingbr br there isnt much of a story as midnight cowboy is a series of vignettes destined to bring forth not only joe bucks plights in the city but also intercut to his past and show us in shock cuts and semipsychedelic dream sequences snippets of his past his failed relationship with his girlfriend annie jennifer salt who was gangraped his abandonment by his mother and his apparent abuse by his grandmother who also had a habit of hustling men for money an air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the wistful beginning as nilsson plays throughout the opening credits his deceptively flowery everybodys talking we feel that even while we want joe to eventually make his mark in the city the odds are high he wont and will end up working for pennies in a deadend job  shown in a masterful shot from his outside point of view later in the film as he watches a man work as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself we know from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like thisbr br a dark story of dashed hopes john schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the 60s and at the center the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sort of meaning to their lives amidst the elusive comfort of a dignified life there is the implied notion that they may have been lovers  ratsos reaching out to hug joe in the party scene and their the final embrace at the end certainly points at this  but this is essentially a buddy film one that manages to survive literally to the death and bring some form of hope to joe who at the end in florida seems much changed older wiser
1,unbleepingbelievable meg ryan doesnt even look her usual pert lovable self in this which normally makes me forgive her shallow ticky acting schtick hard to believe she was the producer on this dog plus kevin kline what kind of suicide trip has his career been on whoosh banzai finally this was directed by the guy who did big chill must be a replay of jonestown  hollywood style wooofff
5,i just saw the movie on tv i really enjoyed it i like a good mystery and this one had me guessing up to the end sean connery did a good job i would recomend it to a friend
0,demonicus rocked you guys need to understand how hard it rocked unfortunately the words needed to explain the extent of the rocking have not been discovered for a tiny idea pop like 50 hits of e watch death factory while on the phone with jesus wait jesus is on call waiting youre having phone sex with will smith on the primary line seriously that movie so good you need to watch it at least a times to catch all the subtleties well not so much subtleties as much as it takes the length of the movie times in order to ponder why the people at full moon are allowed to a live and b reproduce what is our world coming to
2,prior to this film i had only seen two films by director andrea bianchi the trashy zombie flick le notti del terrore 1981 famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from manchild peter bark and the enjoyably sleazy giallo strip nude for your killer neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema but both were entertaining in their own special way and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity didnt hurt massacre however is dull dull dull despite quite a bit of splatter and the odd spot of gratuitous bare fleshbr br the story about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are residing during their shoot is confusing and ohso boring when the blood isnt flowing and the skin isnt on show the film is a real struggle to sit through it took me four attempts to finish with endless scenes of unlikeable characters bickering among themselves and doing very little of notebr br the only point of interest about the film is that its producer lucio fulci used several of its death scenes to pad out his megagory movie cat in the brain aka nightmare concert and if youve already seen that film then there is very little reason to bother with massacre
6,its such a shame that because of its title this film will be avoided by people who hate football bend it like beckham is much more than a cheesy sports flick the story line is touching and intelligent without being soppy the jokes were laugh out loud funny and the characters are well acted parminder nagra and keira knightley are brilliant as teenagers jess and jules putting in great performances both on and off the pitch anupam kher is wonderful as jess worried father and jonathan rhysmeyers who was so amazingly evil in ride with the devil comes across so well as the nice guy for once making full use of his gorgeous irish accent even if you dont like football go see this film if anything itll make you smile
0,sunday july 16 800pm the castro san franciscobr br as a southern colonel your makeup is very indianabr br the yammering gossips of hollywood have managed to sling more than a little mud in marion davies direction over the years that she had fame handed to her and was undeserving is often speculated considering the mawkish dramas she was so often pushed into this criticism would seem to have some validity as a comedienne however her star shone very brightly left to pursue a career in light comedy and slapstick she might have rivaled mabel normand one of her better outings was king vidors show people 1928 which survives and is so well known largely because mgm filled it with star cameos this happy coincidence inadvertently saved what is surely among the best work of its two stars davies and that notorious joe college wisecracker william haines rumor has it show people was loosely based on the life of gloria swanson who began in sennett comedies and rose to grand drama and dont think she didnt spend the rest of her life reminding everyone with von stroheim walsh and demille coincidentally the comedy studios used in this film are the original digs keystone had abandoned the year before think of who worked therebr br colonel marmaduke oldfish pepper dell henderson drives his daughter peggy davies from georgia to hollywood to star in the movies these two country hicks are unsuspecting fodder for incorrigible billy boone haines   a custard pie artist  who descends on their cafeteria table in an outrageously funny entrance watch for the bit with the noodle and then helps peggy land a part in his next picture what she thinks is high drama turns out to be screwball but a job is a job and billy convinces her    all the stars have to take it on the chin   at the preview billy and peggy bump into  charlie chaplin who asks for her autograph she pushes the little fellow aside and a horrified billy grabs the book and makes her sign chaplin climbs in his car and billy tells peggy who shes just snubbed so naturally she faints its so very funny considering davies character isnt supposed to recognize this guy peggy soon moves on to work at the high art studios changes her name to patricia pepoire and leaves poor billy behind davies does a wonderful sendup of a serious actress with all the prerequisite fluttering eyelashes and quivering lips vidor throws in a parade of stars eating lunch in a long tracking shot and theyre all sitting shoulder to shoulder facing the camera that includes polly moran whos also sensationally funny playing davies maid louella parsons one of the friendly vampires estelle taylor claire windsor aileen pringle the comedy duo of karl dane with his arm in a sling and george k arthur pretending hes stealing the silverware leatrice joy amused by arthurs antics renee adoree rod eating and smoking la rocque mae murray john in a robe gilbert who also appears driving through the mgm gates early in the picture norma eeeww talmadge looking bitchy and aloof as usual and patricia dressed like marie antoinette sandwiched between douglas fairbanks as he does an amusing trick and william s hart protecting her from doug billy runs into the high art crew on location when the comedy troupe disrupts their filming with predictably nutty results vidor even works himself into the final scene as the director of peggys current production also worth noting are harry gribbon as the comedy director doing a great caricature of eddie sedgwick sidney bracy as the dramatic director who cant get peggy to cry for her screen test and then cant stop her once she does and paul ralli as andre her dramatic love interest and a hilarious phony when her character tries to act its as though davies is poking fun at all the awful dramas shed been forced into and shes brilliant doing itbr br while its true show people is a hokey satire of the good ole days ten years hence it remains a highly entertaining example of quality work from mgm irving thalberg and their tremendous wealth of assembled talent what a shame so much has been lost there are also far too many examples of great films like the patsy 1928 vidor and davies hugely successful comedy from earlier that same year languishing in vaults when they could be seen and enjoyed
0,the 12th animated disney classic is a reasonable movie told through a simple story even though a little dated it deserves a place in the list of disney classicsbr br its not among disneys top works but is satisfying one of disneys most simple works yes but keeps a certain magic and enchantment which old disney is well known for this was an important movie because it saved disney from a delicate situation if this was a failure there wouldnt be any more disney animated classicsbr br cinderella is somehow like a return to disneys 1st animated classic snow white and the seven dwarfs because it brings back the fairy tale genre its not clear where the story takes place but i suppose its somewhere in france because this is based in a tale by charles perraultbr br there are plenty of likable characters such as cinderella the prince bruno the dog jaques and gus the two main mice the fairy godmother for a fairy she sure is funny the birds the king and the grand dukebr br jaques is very smart and amusing i love his voice really has that mouselike quality gus might not be that smart but hes humorousbr br the king is hilarious but i think that what makes him so funny is his short temper the grand duke is a very cool chap and funny too theyre two of my favorite characters in this film and responsible for many of the most amusing momentsbr br the prince is certainly one of the most charming in disney no doubt that prince philip from sleeping beauty was inspired on this prince because they are very similarlookingbr br on the other hand lady tremaine the stepmother isnt supposed to be likable because shes cold jealous bitter and cruel her daughters anastacia and drizella arent much better than her however the stepmother isnt as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters cinderella the main character has nothing to do with them cinderella is gentle kind pretty and lovable by the way i think her beautiful pink dress is much nicer than the one given by the fairy godmotherbr br lucifer the cat is hilariously malicious the way he walks sticking up his nose in the air and those arrogant and snobbish facial expressions make him funny ironically hes very much like the stepmother when it comes to personality he always agrees with the stepmothers attitudes towards cinderella lucifer has the right name for him because hes such a devilish and mean cat yet theres nothing annoying about himbr br the soundtrack is simple but pleasant although not among disneys best the best song in this movie is bibiddi bobiddi boobr br there are plenty of well known talented voice actors in this such as james macdonald marion darlington eleanor audley verna felton and luis van rootenbr br despite being simplelooking the movie has good artwork as well as its nice details although never something outofthisworld however the kings palace is a spectacular masterpiece being truly majestic and colossal
7,id even say some shades of hitchcockthis is clearly better than mmm which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most woody fans by the way did you know that annie hall was first conceived as a murder mystery anyhow woody reclaims some relevance in film comedy with this one the plot turns are nice and tight i will say that in the first 20 minutes or so some of the actors are a little too hasty at delivering their lines but stick around scarlett johansson proves wellcast in the diane keatontype role and at no time is there any uncomfortable moments between her and the much older woody no one could imagine a more perfect actor for the role of peter lyman than jackman
5,this film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of warmth but ultimately this effort is too vain and too strongly focussed on the leads there is no doubt that mary tyler moore knows what to do with all her screen time but she takes too much of the limelight away from the rest of the castbr br another problem is the overburdening of the script with cliches the daughter who secretly drops out of college an older woman finding it difficult to get a good job and first ends up with fairly demeaning work the sleazy network executive with his executive toys who goes for glitz over substance the journalist who sticks up for her beliefs etc there is nothing really wrong with any of these ie they are all firmly rooted in reality but in combination they are just too much and leave us with too much dejavu and too few surprises
7,land of plenty is not a film it is a tombstone for the directorial career of german director wim wendersbr br many felt it in the million dollar hotel and now land of plenty makes it perfectly clear not only has wenders lost it hes actually turned into a bad director creating horribly weak and superficial stories and scenesbr br one might argue that the time you lose it comes for every director but wenders case is extreme its as if he completely forget everything he knew about cinema and started all over again  only to get sloppish resultsbr br in a few words this film does not deserve your time
6,it was a decent movie i actually kind of enjoyed it but the ending is so abrupt there is absolutely no closure and it leaves tons of loose ends what happens after the concert what happens with her boyfriend does she hook up with grant does she come beck in the next semester and what about angela obviously hollys performance would knock angela down a few pegs but nothing is shown to indicate how she reacts there is so much left up in the air and its very unsatisfying i dont know if it is trying to leave room for a sequel or something but it is a terrible ending and i think that it really makes the movie a joke i was very disappointed
7,when my wife and i decided to watch this movie we thought it couldnt fail i love billy crystal my wife loves julia roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved itbr br we were misled in spadesbr br on my part i felt billy crystals character was extremely onedimensional and did very little for the film sure he cracked a couple of good jokes but as a character he did nothing but take up spacebr br and poor julia roberts in past shows she plays well as a strongwilled selfdetermined lady in this flick she seems completely repressed and had very little fire this is not the julia roberts that my wife enjoys watchingbr br ok if i were to find one good thing it would have to be christopher walken now thats entertainment but just like billy crystal hardly anything is shown of his characterbr br if youre looking for a night of mindless laughs with very little redeeming value go see it but if youre looking for a smart romantic comedy this is not your film its none of the above
4,it is very rare for a film to appeal to viewers of all agesto children for a fine narrative and a wonderful colorful production and to adults for a literate script fine production values good castingacting all bound together with a fine rozsa score two roughly contemporary films accomplish thisthief of baghdad 1940 and the adventures of robin hood 1938 some of the back story on this production is fascinating this production commenced in england in the summer of 1939 moved to hollywood and proved a cover for british intelligence efforts the producer alexander korda was subsequently knighted in 1942 here is a unique case of the intersection of art commerce and politics by all means secure a good cd of this film for your library
5,on the 26th of september 1983 a short dumpy 60 year old woman stood trial for the attempted murder of leonie haddad a lady whose husband had recently died and had agreed to take in a lodger who came via a housing authority for the elderly haddad was not made aware that her new lodger had in fact come fresh from the patton state mental hospital where she had been incarcerated for an inexplicable knife attack on a married couple three years previously haddad soon realised that something was rotten in denmark when the woman began to lock herself in the bathroom with a tape recorder reciting prophesies about seven gods haddads fears were confirmed one night when she awoke to find her lodger sitting astride her chest holding a bread knife announcing that god has inspired me to kill you haddad managed to knock her assailant out with a telephone but not before she had lost a finger and suffered deep lacerations to her face and chest it was a miracle she survived the lodger was judged to be innocent by reason of insanity but sent kicking and screaming back to the laughing academy ten years later she was released and found that she was now a celebrity but not for the brutal attacks on her innocent victims but for her incarnation of 25 years earlier when she was known as the queen of the curves the tennessee tease and miss pin up girl of the world  the notorious bettie page br br director mary harron mainly known for american psycho takes us back to the glory days of a legendary cheesecake and bondage model played solidly enough by gretchen mol who inadvertently wrote the blue print for fetish iconography and whose influence can be detected in everything from comic books to catwalks tnbp is dayglo fun ride through an evocative depiction of the 1950s where page with the familial help of good intentioned boyfriends and photographers becomes the number one star of pocket sized mens glossies with titles like wink tab and parade her real dream of movie stardom evades her and a brush with the authorities over obscenity charges in 1957 is the inciting incident which leads her to retire from modelling and give herself to god the overall style of the film is light and frothy and only darkens momentarily with an allusion to her fathers incestuous attentions and a sexual assault which inexplicably appears to have no discernible effect on her mol plays page as she seems in her photographs happy carefree and fun  even the bondage shots betray little more than a good humoured incomprehensibility the film ends on the upbeat with page cheerfully handing out bibles in a park with no indication of the real life unhappy marriages personal tragedy and decent into murderous insanity which lay before her avoiding what i think is the essential core of pages story  rebirth and resurrection br br having emerged from a decade of incarceration page found that her cult had been in the ascendance since the mid 1980s and that she had become a huge underground icon during which many were asking whatever happened to bettie page her mysterious disappearance fed the fires of any number of conspiracy theories only adding to the allure of her legend when the worlds media finally caught up with her she gave no hint of her darker past and she was soon giving interviews for magazines tv and being photographed at playboy parties with the likes of pamela anderson and the equally tragic anna nicole smith she found that she was now more famous than she ever was in her glory years but in the glare of this resurrection it was only a matter of time before the full story would come to light br br the only notorious thing about the notorious bettie page is they left out the part when she became truly notorious
0,tripping over i must say at first i was a little disappointed in the first few episodes but having faith in the show and abe forsythes unquestionable talent i continued to watch i can safely say im now glad that i did the story did develop quite well and all the characters have a strong base and most dont have any information missingbr br the only thing i can fault in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation possessed by the character lizziebr br some good acting coupled with a stellar plot really gets this show over the line heres to hoping for another season
7,every child experiences trauma growing up and every childs active imagination has gotten the best of them but for jake anthony de marco  of the forthcoming clint eastwood film changeling  who resembles henry thomas circa 1982 the combination may prove deadly br br a lonely six year old whose imagination kicks into high gear when he is crestfallen to learn his quarrelling parents peter sean bridgers late of deadwood and jules brooke bloom cbs miami suddenly decide to divorce leaving him to his own devices and unleashing a new tenant  a zombie in his closetbr br jake actually gets this seed planted while playing with neighborhood friend dillon matthew josten who provides him with a print out off the internet of faq re zombies jake is so convinced that one is out to get him  and his family  he begins to hatch a plan of action to protect them before its too latebr br indie newcomer shelli ryan  who wrote and directed  blends domestic drama with underlings of horror but the former smartly outweighs the latter with a decent story buoyed by fine actingde marco is the rare breed of child actor where he is a child and not acting  all his nuances are very evident of the awkward shy introverted child that many can relate too i certainly can bridgers makes his cheating husband empathetic in the realization he really loves his son while bloom has the more difficult job of building sympathy as the somewhat lackadaisical mother who is quick to emotions over rationality  it doesnt help when dillons mother ruth monette magrath who resembles laura dern is constantly feeding her implied information driving a wedge between jake and his dad magrath also has a tough task to make her manipulative character relatively likable but she proves to in a revealing scene that i wont go into detail but shows why she is the way she is and more importantly how she has also affected her own childbr br the fillmmakers subjective camera is also well employed many angles shown form jakes pov at waistlevel or somewhat skewed ie the upside down shot of peter carrying his son in the same position while having some fun in the backyard and the editing is relatively flawless br br ryan based the screenplay on personal experiences growing up and also witnessing first hand account of a friend going through the same situation and how the affects of adult relationships can be harmful if inflicting their fears anger and stress onto their children here the film is very successful in getting its theme acrossbr br however the horror underpinnings are a little disjointed to say the least but the homage to george a romeros zombie films are shown lovingly by ryan jakes mom is asleep in front of the tv as night of the living dead unspools causing his own belief of the undead to be in their home the metaphor of a monster acting as surrogate to domestic abuse may be a bit heavyhanded but again the childs fear of a thing under his bed is universal
4,i didnt know it was possible to release a movie this bad the labeling sounded so promising but you would think that with a cast of 20 at least one of them would be able to act my wife left me and went to bed after the first 20 minutes she made a wise decision
2, review may contain some spoilers  ill make this review short and sweet i bought this movie from best buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like kevin spacey and morgan freeman how bad could it be right well its pretty bad justin timberlake plays pollack a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at edisons police force ll cool j is deed a cop within the force on a special force team called frat first response assault tactics hes teamed with an ontheedge bad cop named lazerov dylan mcdermott in the opening scene we see lazerov  deed taking on some bank robbers but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs i dont want to give to much away but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs pollack who works for ashford morgan freeman goes to a trial involving deeds  lazerov he suspect foul play and with the help of ashford does some investigate that turns ugly wallace kevin spacey who is all within the frat team joins with ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justicebr br you can tell from the beginning that freeman and spaceys performance are pretty lackluster the only person that give a all out performance is dylan mcdermott he is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me ll cool j is terrible in this film he says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion he was much better in movies like deep blue sea  any given sunday the film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film the ending is far from satisfyingbr br dont waste your time with this film im putting it on ebay this weekend
1,i would have given this otherwise terrific series a full 10 vote if claudia black had not continued on in it her inclusion as the silly vela has brought the series down in my estimation to bring her in as a regular at the same time as including ben browder to replace rda was a mistakebr br unfortunately we were just reeling from the loss of jack and really didnt need this great series turned into new episodes of farscapebr br i was a great fan of the film stargate and when the series was first announced i had reservations that it could live up to the film but after watching the first episode i have to admit i was hooked i have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation
0,spacecamp is one of the movies that kids just love and mom and dad can have fun watching as well growing up in the 80s i enjoyed this movie its plot and all the actors i recently purchased this movie on dvd so when i have kids of my own they will be able to have as much fun watching this movie as i did the plot is fun a group of kids embark on a journey they never expected when they were rocketed into space by a overachieving robot they were in auh at first but when they realized they didnt have enough oxygen to make it back panic sunk in once they recovered enough oxygen from the space station they returned to earth as even better friends and a new found respect for life
6,this animated inspector gadget movie is pretty lamethe story is very weakand there is little actionmost of the characters are given little to nothing to dothe movie is mildly entertaining at bestbut really doesnt go any where and is pointlessits watchable but only just and is nowhere near the calibre of the animated tv show from the 80sits not a movie that bears repeat viewingat least in my mindits only about 74 minutes long including creditsso i guess thats a good thingunlike in the tv showthe characters are not worth rooting for herein the showyou wanted inspector gadget to save the daybut therewho really caresanywaythats just my opinionfor me inspector gadgets last case is a disappointing 310
1,this horror movie based on the novel of the same name suffers from flawed production and choppy amateurish direction but its nonetheless strangely compelling unlike shocker horror flicks such as the exorcist this movie takes the viewer on a slow yet relentless dip into a pool of evil it drifts into horror which dawns on the audience with the same dreamlike slowness as it dawns on the poor girl whos been unwittingly chosen to be the next sentinel her appointed task is to sit at the gates of hell and prevent evil from erupting into the world this falls on her in atonement for her attempted suicide earlier in her lifebr br the story is true to the book which was riveting but the way its edited can lose the viewer there are subtleties in the plot that are shaved away and never explained satisfactorily which hurts this film thats a pity the sentinel is not an edgeofyourseat kind of flick its more a watchandsquirm uncomfortably like a bad car wreck theres a compulsion to look even when it becomes unbearable this movie isnt all bad and still has a capacity to shockbr br the cast was competent christina raines was captivating as alison the vulnerable girl under spiritual attack from both sides a pawn in the neverending battle between good and evil chris sarandon was good as her caring but ultimately selfcentered boyfriend eli wallach and a very young christopher walken are the detectives struggling to unravel the bizarre puzzle theyve been handed ava gardner is elegant as the realtor unaware of the horrors lurking in her rental property the gaunt elderly john carradine with his arthritistwisted hands is excellent as the dying sentinel who must be replaced the devil is played to charming perfection by burgess meredith hes so sweet and yet so evil there are future stars hidden in this film beverly dangelo and jeff goldblum as friends of the poor girl and jerry orbach playing successfully against type as a jerky television director the damned souls at the end are portrayed by actual sideshow freaks and geeks whoever thought to do that was a twisted but brilliant geniusbr br the horror that pervades the movie bubbles up unexpectedly such as when alison opens a door and finds something that evokes a flashback to when she found her father with his two whores she relives her first suicide attempt faces a pair of strangely dysfunctional lesbians and sees a cat cut up as a cake time and again shes yanked back and forth through reality and fantasy through dreams and waking nightmares all the while lacking the means to cope in truth the devil is trying to drive her insane enough to kill herself before becoming the next sentinel will he succeed in summary slowmoving yet indescribably creepy wellacted but poorly directed and a very typical 70s horror film before the real shockers cut loose no pun intended this movie may not work for those with a short attention span but it can still send chills up the spine and still can provide some lowkey shock value it remains a strangely compelling and entertaining dip into the realm of evil
5,am i the only one who saw the connection between the discussion of camus the myth of sisyphus and marys life in camus version a man is condemned to spend his eternity with a giant boulder that he must roll up a hill unfortunately every time he reaches the top the boulder slips and ends up back at the bottom for him to start there may have been a buzzard pecking at his eyes im not sure right now in the movie mary spends her life struggling to get her life together unfortunately every time she gains any footing she falls and loses everything case in point would be the party she throws where she gets intoxicated offends her falafel lover and is practically attacked by liev schrieber in case you question this theory note how this scene ends with her attempting to climb a flight of stars while books fall from nowhere impeding her progress until ultimately she passes out the next morning when she awakens she is still on the stairs never having reached the top
0,this movie is not your typical horror movie it has some campy humor and death scenes which can be sort of comical i personally liked the movie because of its offbeat humor its definetely not a super scary movie which is good if you dont want to be scared and paranoid afterwards i liked the performance of the hillbilly guy and of lester very believable i think im going to dye my hair red like that girl in scarecrow very cool anyway overall worth renting for the campy humor and non typical horror experience
1,watching this stinker constitutes cruel and unusal punishment at the hands of sandler truly a slow and painful deathbr br bought the dvd in the 588 bin at wal mart but the thought that keeps echoing in my head is how can i get my money backbr br the most unforgivable thing about the movie is that the boat just does not sinkbr br best constructive suggestion mystery comedy theatre you know that show on the scifi channel in which some guy and his muppetmachines spoof the most unwatchable horror flicks mystery science theatre immediately spin off a comedy program and feature this flick without a good humorous spoof of this train wreck i fear that viewers may actually begin following sandler with ice picks and chainsawsbr br 
2,this was a terrible film there was no story line whatsoever to top it all off when they couldnt explain the blood and gore the only good part  they threw in a few aliens i hate when directors or whatever run out of ideas and then blame the aliens watch this film if you like but dont say i didnt warn you two things how could vinny say welcome when he didnt have a tongue its a pity mr jones didnt have a bigger role second thing that bugged me why were we shown vinny jones boils and him cutting them off and putting them into blue liquid then these have no further role why not i dont like to be shown something and that has nothing to do with the story line whatsoever in short bad story i wouldnt waste my time  wish id have watched mirrors instead
5,i think this is almost all i need to say i feel obliged to explain my actions though ive basically never seen such an armateur production and i mean that in all senses of the word although the physical camera work boom mic operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable unfortunately its not the only areasbr br unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great characterization and plot this unfortunately has an awful script awful acting and worst of all awful annoying charactersbr br its a crime that for the every independent film that gets distribution like haiku tunnel theres a 101 other indie films that died silent deaths i dont know who the kornbluth brothers know at sony but that can be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution im quite bemused as to why they picked this upbr br the only part of this film that holds out any intrigue is its title however the reason for that is even a let down i hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it ive seen a lot of films in my time and im very forgiving when in the cinema but this was too much ill never forget tunnel for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema shame its such a low pointbr br

5,its a very good movie not only for the fans of lady death comics but also for those who like animated moviesseries of adventure and fantasybr br the film is about a innocent girl who is about killed for something she hadnt done but for be who she is daughter of the ruler of hell lucifer himselfbr br then she seeks revengeand the rest you better see it from the moviebr br i liked the movie a lot the characters are like the original comics form chaos i never had the chance of read the the first parts of the story in comics only the last ones after the passages in the movie so i cannot tell you if the events are exactly like the comics butone way or another its the story of lady death
2,much as we all love al pacino it was painful to see him in this movie a publicity hack at the grubby ending of what seems to have once been a distinguished and idealistic career pacino plays his part looking like an unmade bed and assaulting everyone with a totally bogus and inconsistent southern accentbr br the plot spools out this way and that with so many loose ends and improbabilities that the mind reels and then retreatsbr br kim basinger is there not doing much her scenes with pacino are flat and unconvincing hard to believe they meant a lot to each other theres no energy therebr br tea leone on the other hand lit up the screen she was electric and her scenes with pacino were by far the most interesting in the movie but not enough to save al from embarrassment
0,although this seems to be quite an old show 2002 i watched my first ever episode last night and i have to say it has to be the worst show    everbr br i am not one for placing comments but i was so shocked that a show could exist that blatantly tries to pander to and i am only assuming that this was their target audience children under 12 years old or people with a less than average iqbr br the episode i was subjected to last night contained so many disjointed story lines tried to include every possible plot summary imaginable and all the while trying to preach about friendship family religion and politics br br basic story that they covered in the episode frat house hazing gone wrong wrong with too much alcohol  death turns out to be senators son who wants fbi to investigate death is actually murder by peanut allergy senator thinks it could be his sworn enemy and childhood best friend who did this because senator was taking money for his votes for legislation but eventually got a conscience and said no to mean mulit millionaire everybody a suspect but all have the usual alibi exgirlfriend student shagging a married teacher so had to lie disgruntled student who was reported by victim actually had life changing experience senators enemy did not pay desperate student to kill sworn enemies son he gives money freely to lots of broke students all the while the heroine of this dribble has her niece staying who is at that age and has a crush on a boy who she eventually gets the courage to talk to with the assistance of her aunty but only to dump him because the in girls says he is not good enough and so to keep in with them she dumps him dont worry she gets back with boy after she learns the truth about life and the in girls drop her aunty also explains that god is the only one who truly she can rely on i was almost sick at this pointbr br this drama gets even better when sue and her fbi team find out who the killer is    your gonna laugh at this i sure did    br br it is one of the frat boys who only a year ago found out he was adopted and that his real dad is an international terrorist and he is trying to impressive real daddy by killing boy and planting bomb at funeral        br br the characters are cardboard the acting is cardboard the continuity is cardboard the story is cardboard anybody who says that they love this show has cardboard for a brainbr br why the writers of this show have tried to pack in every eventuality into the one show means that they obviously have no faith in the character development or actors capability to carry off a simple plot line watching this show is like watching last action hero with arnie killing 5000 people with a tooth pick except arnie is a better actor wow never thought there would be a day that i would say that br br in the words of the simpsons beloved character comic book guy     br br worst tv show      ever
3,when i first watched this we borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and watched it about times weve just watched it again and i liked it more than i did the last time id watched it  br br the film is mainly about two dogs called charlie and itchy voiced by dom deluise and i love dom deluise  charlie is half a gangster and half a goodie which i like itchy is his sidekick charlie is killed by his friend not and sent to heaven when charlie comes back to life it is the start of an amazing adventurebr br the five main reasons why im absolutely crazy about this film one i love the characters except carface my favourite three are charlie itchy and a little girl called annemarie who comes slightly later two i love the period of history in which this film is set it is set during the prohibition in the united states three the don bluth animation as usual is superb the backgrounds are good too four there is a strange excitement in this film that keeps me on the edge of my seat five the songs in this are lovely my favourite song starts with i need brazil the throb the thrillbr br so watch this lovely film when you can you wont be disappointed   
0,as a poker enthusiast i was looking forward to seeing this movie  especially as it had scotty nyugen in itbr br basically scotty nyugens short spots in this film are all it has going for itbr br the characters are unlikeable and annoying the soundtrack is awful and the plot well there isnt onebr br i honestly got a headache and found myself reading the barcode number on the dvd box after twenty minutes i was that bored its actually ashame that nyugen was in this movie as otherwise i wouldnt have wasted 16 buying it off ebaybr br take it from me  avoid like offsuit dire 
0,this film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures sure the effects are laughable the story confused but just watching hasselhoff in his knight rider days is always fun i especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in it added to what little suspense was mustered give it a
0,channel is a channel that allows more naughty stuff than any of the other channels this show was certainly a naughty one the presenter of this sometimes gross adult chat show fourtime bafta winning and british comedy award winning also twice nominated graham norton was just the perfect gay host for a good show like this it had one or more famous celebrities in the middle of it they basically had an adult idea which would either gross humiliate or humour the guest but some are not for the fainthearted they had women playing the recorder with their parts men using their dicks to play a xylophone women weeing upwards in the bath men with or without pants under their kilts and many more gross but hilarious ideas this is just for adults but enjoy it it won the bafta twice for best entertainment programme or series it won the british comedy awards for best comedy entertainment programme also nominated best comedy talk show it won an emmy for episode 18  and it won the national television awards twice for most popular talk show it was number 52 on the 100 greatest funny moments very good
5,i had to watch this in school and to sum it upbr br talentless actors talentless script and a talentless directorbr br this movie is such a waste of your time dont even watch the movie dont bother you will be so disappointed my teacher said it was supposed to be good how wrong she was she even slept through it a little the movies actors were just bad the best actor in there was the old man and thats not saying much its has horrible plot with awful characters so unrealistic and i can honestly said it had no point the script was unemotional and confusing there was points in the movie when i furrowed my brows and said what also there were just too many loose ties and plot holes it was just absolutely horrendous
0,musings pure delight from beginning to end not a laugh riot but a more subtle sophisticated humor what a goldmine of great scenes and character actors including reginald denny nestor paiva ian wolfe harry shannon and jason robards sr br br cary grant is at the building sight of his new home which is at that point being framed a young carpenter played by future tarzan lex barker asks him if he wants his lallies to be rabbeted or some such thing that only a carpenter would know grant not wanting to appear ignorant replies in the affirmative at that barker yells up to his mates ok boys he wants em rabbeted soyank em out a second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards all grant can do is moanbr br yes the movie is dated youd never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home and a place like that in connecticut of all places would probably run a few million bucksbr br a classic movie that is really a treasure
3,from the star of mitchell from the director of joysticks and angels revenge these are taglines that would normally keep me from seeing this movie and the worst part is that all the above mentioned statements are true ugghhh joe don baker eats every other five minutes in this film its like a bad remake of coogans bluff

4,the thought of sarah silverman having her own show worried me at first the films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off however i was very surprised to see her true colors shine in this comedy central gem i could possibly put her on par with the likes of amy sedaris in strangers with candy  sarahs character is a true sociopath very comparable to sedaris jerri blankbr br the one downfall of this show is its supporting cast her sisters character is good funny at times but ultimately meant not to steal sarahs show however the rest of the cast is extremely subpar in comparisonbr br im glad though that comedy central has given sarah a chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor
5,booted out of heaven a gang of horny naked female angels with big plastic fangs have taken up residence in a spooky forest where they feed upon any hapless souls who should wander by its not long before a group of friends on a road trip are falling victim to the bloodthirsty babes an independent low budget horror made in the uk forest of the damned takes an interesting premise and flushes it down the pan with some of the worst acting effects and direction i have seen in a long timebr br director johannes roberts shows some occasional flair behind the camera  the scenes in the delapidated house are fairly tense and there are some deftly handled shock moments  but for the most part the film is technically amateurish throw in some truly awful performances from horror icons tom savini and shaun hutson and you have one real bad movie on your handsbr br some fun may be derived from the films sheer shoddiness and there is loads of female nudity for the guys to savour but most will find this a chore to sit through
7,the major flaw with the film is its uninspired script it plods back and forth between vignettes of betties story and recreations of the klaw short films while the klaw recreations are well done it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety page richards while not an amazing actress does a decent job overall and at times she does bear a remarkable resemblance to bettie also of note is some faithful attention to detail costumes and clothing well done as is some of the set direction the sets are generally sparse and feel stagey but do feel of the era it is sometimes surprisingly well lit and the color palette was clearly thoughtout to give the overall look a vibrant retro feel
6,if you like films that ramble with little plot exposition spiced with kinky sex this film is for you on the plus side the lead actoractress newcomer transsexual does have an interesting screen presence but not enough to add up to much more than a mildly interesting movie  if that essentially this film is about social outcasts transexual prostitute male hustler and russiangay immigrant who somehow have developed a bond why is not clear we are expected to accept these misfits are at the core basic honest people who have the ability to love while they hustle their bodies on the street right and anna nicole smith was truly in love with her ninety something sugar daddy the filmmaker shows a gritty unpleasant side of life while wanting us to believe underneath it all these seriously damaged people are really quite normal to the extent they have a menage a trois which helps them through life quite a fantasy but unfortunately portrayed here as real look of life on the wild side in sum no plot no truth and no real reason to spend much time here unless of course you just like to revel in the kink
7,the story of a drifter his sheep ranch boss and the bosss daughter is not for all tastes but its still very intriguing it takes place in the beautiful country of new zealand amongst the scenery weve come to know so well through other films from this regionbr br this movie was the first time i had ever seen the excellent mary regan and ive been a fan of hers ever since the cast also contains bruno lawrence who is probably best remembered by american audiences from the film smash palace terence cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner who pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter regan br br sharply acted with unforgettably shattering performances from all of its leads i first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in america but believe you me the unexpurgated version is not to be missed
7,as a huge fan of only the first seasons of bsg and the stand alone feature bsg razor i was hoping that this release would return the franchise to its original glory days usually i have no problem with science fiction that is mostly dialog driven as opposed to a visual bonanza of special effects if the script is tight with some original ideas delivered by good actors one can create a profound film with little cgi money spent this prequel has none of those aforementioned requirements going for it the virtual reality world created by the terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous  unbelievable this scene was simply put there to raise the release rating to restricted not that teens dont love virtual reality mosh pits filled with sex  violence  heavy dance music its the part about those same teens having the intellectual depth  reason or political  religious passion as to create such futuristic software or become suicide bombers that perplexes me these kids are definitely not from this planet the movie plays out like a soap opera with only the last 10 minutes being slightly interesting the scene with eric stolz giving his cyborg a devine conscienceness via the student firmware upgrade was amusing if not entertaining but this old concept was far better portrayed  much more believable in the brilliant classic original frankenstein with boris karloff caprica rips off its only interesting idea from an old hollywood horror film no surprise there overall this movie was bland  unoriginal  cheap looking using recycled cgi of caprica from bsg i doubt ill be watching this space soap when it premieres on the scifi channel unless of course i happen to be suffering from a bad bout of insomnia at which time this show would definitely be the cure zzzzzzzz
7,this film is about a male escort getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful mens wivesbr br i thought the walker would be thrilling and engaging but i was so wrong the pacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow that even after 40 minutes of the film nothing happens much seriously the first hour could be condensed into ten minutes thats how slow it isbr br the fact that it lacks any thrills or action scenes aggravates the boredom its almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion maybe it is because of the stiff upper lip of the higher social class br br its sad that the walker becomes such a boring mess despite such a strong cast blame it on the poor plot and even worse pacing
1,i turned this on to see the incredible ethel waters whose autobiography i am now reading ill admit my jaw dropped when the pork chops and watermelon references started rolling in but people cannot look at this movie as a stereotypical or racist piece its pretty much a short film made by blacks for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was quite segregated and the stereotypes to the people involved were the jokes of their time old trends exaggerated for humor we see modern black movies do the same thing but with the new trends stereotypes hos and the hood and such i think if you look back in eighty years you would find todays movies will look just as racist what viewers should appreciate about this film is the talent of waters and the pintsized sammy davis jr who out taps his contemporary shirley temple and looks remarkably the same facially as he did as an adult everyone involved in this film clearly had a lot of fun making it why not enjoy it for what it is instead of what you think it should have been
7,i was literally preparing to hate this movie so believe me when i say this film is worth seeing overall the story and gags are contrived but the film has the charm and finesse to pull them off that gag where jason lee thinks he has crabs and tries not to let his bossfuture fatherinlaw and coworkers see him scratching himself isnt terribly intelligent but it sent me into a frenzy of laughter very few of the films gags are highbrow but they made me laugh as i said the film has charm and charm can go a long way br br the characters are likable too i must say i wish i got to see more of james brolins character since he was a hoot in the very few scenes he was in plus i admire any romantic comedy that has the guts to not make the character of the wife who serves as the obstacle in the plot a total witch the selma blair character is hardly unlikable and theres never a scene where i thought to myself why did he want to marry her in the first place the ending is hollywoodish but it couldve been much more schmaltzy br br the cast is talented i havent had a favorable view of most of jason lees mainstream work i just loved him so much in kevin smiths films that i couldnt help but feel disappointed at seeing him in these dopey roles and he never looks comfortable in these dopey roles even in this movie he doesnt look perfectly comfortable but he contributes his own two cents and effectively handles each scene but i still miss his work in independent films julia stiles proves again why shes so damn likable of course shes a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint but she also possesses a unique charm and seems to have good personality in other words her beauty shows inside and out i dont know the actresses name but the woman who plays the drunk granny is hilarious julie hagerty also has a small part and shes always enjoyable to watch which makes me wish she received better roles i loved her so much in airplane and lost in america that its a shame she doesnt get the same opportunities to flaunt her skills br br dont be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office records this is a funny charming film romantic comedies are getting so predictable nowadays that it feels like the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet so its always to see a good one among all these bad apples br br my score out of 10
0,i cant believe we dont have that 70s show anymore i have all seasons of that 70s show i absolutely love it i lay in the bed every night and watch several episodes before i go to sleep at the end of a long busy day its nice to kick back and have a great laugh before you go to sleep i was so sad they took the show off air at least we still have the reruns i am hoping and praying they will come back with at least a reunionlike maybe when donna finishes college and we finally get to see her and eric get married wouldnt that be awesome it would be even better if they would continue it for several years
7,i have seen a couple movies on eating disorders but this one was definitely my favorite one the problem with the other ones was that the people with the eating disorders towards the end just automatically get better or accept the fact that they need help and thats it this movie i thought was more realistic cause in this one the main character lexi doesnt automatically just get better she gets better and then has a drawback i think this movie shows more than the others that ive seen that getting better doesnt just happen its hard work and takes time its a long path to recovery i think this movie shows all of that very well there should be more movies like this
0,this movie introduces quite an array of characters and their relationships in the first halfhour or so none of them generate any interest or positive response i waited for the intrigue to begin hoping things would get better and ended up sticking around until the bitter end but there was no reward for doing thatbr br if you want a synopsis look elsewhere to me the action isnt worth recounting not that the story was that bad i guess you could say i had some problems with the scriptie i thought it stunk a look at the credits will show you that theres a pretty strong cast here used to no avail most of the old pros in this flick do good jobs of the actors i hadnt seen much of before i especially liked deborah kara unger thats about all that i can find good to say about this picture
4,this piece of filth is virtually impossible to follow the sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during its productionbr br poor film making aside the story is vile just sick evil sht if you like rape murder and self harm this is right up your alley and if simulated scenes of murder are not enough you can enjoy clips of actual people being executed i watched almost all of it but had to turn off after i seen someones brains blown out never before have i seen a film that left me feeling so ashamed and dirty

2,this film is so bad you cant imagine the acting is terrible even worse than in third class soap operas an it is a shame that this movie was the most successful in the past 20 years in switzerland the interactions between the soldiers didnt make any sense at all the story could have been taken out from a bravo photostory the dialogues were as wooden as treebeard and the plot holes were bigger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy but nowadays it doesnt need much to satisfy the audience the actors were handsome for example the former miss switzerland and the main character was even hung woah and there certainly was much abuse of drugs thats real cool man particularly for 12 and 13 year old teens but the media created an atmosphere in witch you was not allowed to reject the film because they manipulated the peer group dynamics by telling implicitly that you are a nerd if you dont go along with the other sheep and sayyes that is exactly what it was like when i was in the army thats exactly what im going to do when i must go to the army to every cheesy action that had to do with drugs and coolness and dont think i like the army i was there and i hated it but this film is worse than cleaning up the sticky toilet with a teeth brush which i was forced to do because i offended an lieutenant it is not necessary for every film to be sophisticated sometimes you only want to be entertained for a few hours and forget about problems and i think its not a bad thing but this kind of films influence teenagers to much by showing them a cool lifestyle which in fact is only stupid and turns them into brainless ignorant and egocentric idiots but since i now that my opinion isnt very popular i will be quiet now and recommend you to avoid this terrible flick at any costs and for that to save your witsbr br 210br br sorry for my bad english
3,this anime was underrated and still is hardly the dorky kids movie as noted i still come back to this 10 years after i first saw it one of the better movies releasedbr br the animation while not perfect is good camera tricks give it a 3d feel and the story is still as good today even after i grew up and saw groundbreakers like neon genesis evangelion and rahxephon it has nowhere near the depth obviously but try to see it from a lighthearted view its a story to entertain not to questionbr br still one of my favourites i come back too when i feel like a giggle on over more lighthearted animes not to say its a childish movies there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humour to see it all
1,when i read other commenti decided to watch this moviebr br first cast specially michael madsen and tamer karadagli good enoughbr br filmvery intelligence and interesting because cast have a lot of international specially european actor and actress like from turkey and russsiabr br secondstory is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play youll like in my opinionbr br thirdfinal chapter is not special or interestingits regular like other action moviesbr br finallyi recommend to watch this movieand i hope youll love it enjoy d
5,two great comedians in a great neil simon movie based on his hit playbr br great combination especially when the comedians in question are matthau and burns small wonder why burns won an oscar for this hes as sharp and as funny as ever and matthau is every bit his match if a tad more crotchetybr br this is familiar simon territory two old vaudeville partners reunite for a tv special but still cant stand one another after all these yearsbr br its a delight to watch these two pick at each other their scenes together make this film an absolute delight myself i especially enjoyed the knock knock knock  enter scene and if youre a fan of either burns or matthau youll enjoy it toobr br in fact youll enjoy the whole movie br br ten stars put a little sunshine in your life
7,before he became defined as nick charles in the thin man series william powell played another urbane detective named philo vance the supporting cast is strong in this early talkie and powells star quality is evident mary astor who eight years later would be defined by her portrayal of brigid oshaughnessy does a good job here as the featured woman who finds herself in the middle of it all
7,stars and im being generous minor spoilers look this is a low budget zombie movie set in gangland oakland as the plot goes a scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after being killed in a drivebybr br the main problem with this movie what zombies all the zombies do is growl which doesnt sound even remotely scary and drip fake red blood from their mouths no scary eyes no decaying flesh just a bunch of people growling pathetically and running around like idiotsbr br the cover is also misleading there are only about zombies in the whole film so its not like the whole hood is plagued with zombies or anything its just a few and is contained in no timebr br the acting actually is so bad its hilarious no one can act at all in this movie except maybe one of the gang members and it really seems like a bunch of friends got together decided to cast their family and made a movie one weekendbr br final note since when do doctors wear tracksuits skip this one please
0,there was nothing about this movie that i liked it was so obviously lowbudget with bad lighting and camera work almost like blair witch project only it wasnt supposed to be that way there wasnt really much to the plot and the movie just drug on and on i actually fastforwarded through the last 13 of the movies but that did not help matters much it looked like it might be good from the box but i must say again nothing about this movie even resembled good no good actors the special effects were so fake the camera work was horrible and the dialogue was painfully terrible on my own personal scale i give this movie a of 10 yikes
7,this was a strong poirotsuchet television mystery selection the characters were vivid and wellacted the plot and the main settinga student hostel were excellent japp was nothing special but for me did not distract from story one significant point many poirot watchers dont recognize good acting or good characterization i also think they are rather harsh in their judgments of some of the poirot mysteries finally i have read few christie novelsnone in recent years and find it annoying that so many viewers are upset about changes from the novel please viewers consider what is presented to you on film not what you think should be there that said the poirot mysteries vary in quality but not as much as reviewers and raters would have you believe with the singular exception of the five little pigs which was fabulous in plot character and theme the longer poirot films are neither that good or that bad for the record i have seen all the longer poirotsuchet films finally films without lemon hastings andor japp are neither good nor bad because of their absence there presence however is either obtrusive almost always with japp or irrelevant with hastings lemon is in the middle
4,sistas in da hood looking for revenge and bling bling except da hood is a wild west town in the late 1800s i do not remember any westerns like this when i was growing up what would randolph scott say if he saw lil kim he might say alright i have to admit that i tuned into this just to see her bare midriffs and low cut blouses are not the staple of the usual cowboy flick but these are the cowgirls and they are finebr br now dont go looking for any major story here and the usual stuff of ghetto crime drama are here in a different setting and whens the last time you heard john wayne call someone dawg and i dont remember the earp brothers hugging and kissing before they marched to the ok corralbr br i watch this on bet so i missed the action that got it an r rating but i doubt if i will buy the dvd to see it unless i can be assured it was lil kim in that action
6,quite the most boring nonsense i have seen in a long time the plot was full of irrelevance and the acting was the worst i have seen in a long timebr br to make it worse camera angles that made me feel sick were used  the incidental music was terrible and drowned out the dialogue maybe not a bad thing then and the shots of san francisco looked as if they had been stolen straight out of the city tourist boards promotional videobr br oh and the obligatory sex scene was not even half well done better lighting next time please
1,horrible waste of time  bad acting plot directing this is the most boring movie ever there are bad movies that are fun freddy vs jason and there are bad movies that are horrible this one fits into the latter bottom line  dont waste your time
4,i like cheap perfume better it doesnt last as long  ralph meekers convict character lawson tells this to barbara stanwycks helen character after he gets a whiff of the perfume that she picked out wher husband in tijuana this line cracked me up and also seemed like a metaphor for this film  that cheap is better than expensive because a cheap perfumeloving man who has a way with a x is a better man to have around in the long run i agree with some of the other comments posted about helens attraction to lawson even though her narration states that she wants lawson to be put away she did seem attracted to his fiery nature and that passion he stirred up in her wouldnt likely wash away with the tide
0,the sopranos 19992007br br number  television show of all time br br everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that wouldnt go past a pilot episode the sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time br br james gandolfini plays the enigmatic new jersey crime boss tony soprano accompanied by a stellar cast edie falco is superb as the worrying loving uppermiddle class mother tony sirico is tremendous as a superstitious greying consiglieri who is often very funny br br while the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of italianamericans as mafiosi and to an extent this is undeniable i can see so many positives from the show the portrayal of strong family values friendships love and compassion could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters yes furthermore other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism social inequality and injustice homosexuality drugs etc this is no shallow dull show about tough guys and violence it has so much more many of the issues we see on the show are very real br br the writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters lives which makes the whole thing more interestingbr br credit must go to david chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to james gandolfini for envisioning televisions most complex and enigmatic character br br simply exceptionalbr br 1010
6,this movie was very good if you are one who likes to watch horror movies i recommend it the acting was very good although i thought that the actress playing julie could have had more emotion behind her lines allan was very good and i thought the cinematography was amazing i was on the edge of my seat the entire time while my friends were freaking out and screaming it was a complete success in my opinion and should have made it to the big screen i give it two thumbs up i definitely would say that if you havent already seen it then go rent it if you have seen it and didnt like it go and watch it again because there are parts that were completely unreal i also liked how a lot of the movie was filmed around and on my schools campus
5,by dane youssefbr br a gang of crooks the perfect plan it all goes wrong theyre in trouble the police are outside theyre cornered what are they gonna do nowbr br sound familiarbr br the movie seems like its trying to be a combination of the acting workshop the indie film and the theaterbr br its the kind of things that actors loveits kind of like a workshop or a play because it mostly consists of tight focusing on the actors acting acting angry tense scared conversing scheming planninggiving the performers a lot of free range to really ham it all upbr br a trio of crooks one leader one goon one brother come up with a big heist scheme and a monkey wrench is thrown into the works to top things off theres a bit of a fenderbender and one of the crooks in flung through the back of the windshieldbr br the cops are on their tail and they stumble into a bar named poetically and leadenly dinos last chancebr br spacey as a director tries to keep the focus on the actors performances and delivery of dialouge he pans over to a bright passionred cigarette ad of a smoking and smoldering bogart and he keeps all the violence offscreen reallybr br i think that was a mistake focusing on the intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the movie some edgebr br the problem with the movie is that it moves too slow and suffers from miscasting in almost every role matt dillon drugstore cowboy and wild things seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gangbr br gary sinese seems to brooding and deep in thought to be a spineless tagalong with these guys and joe mantaga is effective as the traditional routine foulswearing maddog police lieutenant whos all thumbs but he isnt given anything to really do herebr br william fischter is the only actor who is believable in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to spill bloodbr br and the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they try to think of some way out of thisbr br spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going the characters are mostly chatting away trying to think of a plan and theyre to calm and too articulate theres even a scene where the crooks are playing pool with a whole swarm of armed cops right outside ready to strike at one point one of the crooks even call the police who are right outside the bar oh brother oh botherbr br these cops are going to either blow them away or going to lock them up shouldnt the holedup crooks be a little scared a little uneasy meanwhile all the real action is happening insidebr br someone whips out a gun a baseball bat which leads to an ugly confrontation offscreen and theres one more casualty that happens thats well kinda sad butbr br faye dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect coach improving on her new orleans accent skeet ullrich is fine in a smaller partbr br a cop listening in reaches for a pack of matches at the absolute worst time is a nice look and so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear windshield br br the dialouge is obviously trying to go for a david mamet approach and its as profane but never as realistic or as insightfulbr br the movie feels like too much of what it really is a really lowbudget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script thats not bad but needs a few more rewrites spacey shows hes not a terrible director but he lacks a sort of feel for shaping a movie and it feels like hes just filming actors actbr br these actors are all talented and could work with the material but they all feel out of place as i said before the movie really suffers from miscasting br br i dont mean that the wrong actors were cast i think they found just the right cast but placed them in all the wrong roles i think switching some of the roles wouldve helped immenselybr br having veteran mob actor joe mantagna play the leader of the pack gary sinese as the angry police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn giving orders and barking at his troops keeping fischter in his bloodthirsty goon part and matt dillion as the sacrificial lamb that would have been a big improvementbr br when some actors direct it works they can even win oscars for it but a lot of the time when actors direct they have a tendency to just focus on the performances just shoot the actors actingbr br sometimes it works but they need a good showcase for it an excuse for itbr br hostage situations are all pretty much the same in real life just like comingofage stories so its only natural that movies about them will go from point a to point b as wellbr br there are a few really great entries into this genre spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations the negotiatorbr br this certainly wont become a cult classic let alone one of afis 100 still it does have a few nice moments and personal touches but in the end its instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular tv its just not worth going out of your way to seebr br i give a out of 10 br br spaceys other directorial credit beyond the sea was reportedly a better effort hmmm maybe its true you need to fail before you succeedbr br by dane youssef
6,what a pathetic moviebr br i wont waste much time commenting about it im still trying to get back the couple hours i wasted on itbr br let me leave it simply with  shaq has no business being an actor or singer he is utterly without talent at both discplines its a crying shame that substantially more talented people waste away in community theatres and karaoke bars while shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly get cast in movies and cut cdsbr br much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic notalent that is shaq
0,it seems to be a perfect day for swimming a normal family wants to gain advantage from it and takes a trip to the beach unfortunately it happens that the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the small son is able to help him out of this  whereas the tide is rising the woman barbara stanwyck takes the car and searches for helpbr br john sturges short movie 69 minutes is powerful because of unanswered questions stanwyck finds a guy who could help but there is a price she has to pay for this there is a double question the movie poses how far would you go to help the man that you love and on the other hand  observing stanwycks behaviors towards the stranger  does she really love her husband like a good short story this movie leaves the viewer to himself with questions he can only answer himself
1,considering it was made on a low budget the day time ended manages to make the most of its budget with some surprisingly good special effects workbr br the story involves a family who are about to move into their solarpowered home in an isolated part of the mojave desert in southwestern california only to find it trashedby motorcycle vandals they think but their youngest daughter natasha ryan has begun to see mysterious thingsa green pyramid strange humanoid figures etc and only recently the light from a trinary star explosion has caused extremely unusual auroras to show up in the desert skies thus the family led by jim davis and dorothy malone finds themselves facetoface with strange alien forces who have put them in a timeandspace warpbr br mixing in elements of 2001 a space odyssey and close encounters of the third kind the day time ended despite its obvious flaws and uneven acting remains interesting due to the superb special effects work of david allen the desert setting is very appropriate for this films close encounters and while the movie cannot really be compared with either kubricks or spielbergs films the day time ended is much better than many other 2001close encounters knockoffs i give credit to director john bud cardos whose 1977 thriller kingdom of the spiders made for an interesting precursor to arachnophobia for at least tryingand on that basis i give the day time ended a out of 10
0,there are so many reasons as to why i rate the sopranos so highly one of its biggest triumphs being the cast and character building each character unfolds more and more each series also each series has an array of different small time characters as well as the main a good example of a character who was only in three episodes who you can feel for is david the compulsive gambler played brilliantly by robert patrick every little detail builds the perfect tv series the show revolves round mob boss tony soprano james gandolfini who attempts to balance his life of crime with his role as father of two the show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and imagery and this is what makes it so believable whilst tony runs things with capos paulie tony sirico and silvio steve van zant his nephew christopher michael imperioli looks for a promotion every episode also features tonys other family in some way which includes his children and wife carmela soprano edie falco on top of these problems is his uncle junior soprano dominic chianese is trying to get what he can out of tonys businesses despite being under house arrest all the acting is powerful and characters complex but the two who stand out the most are james gandolfini who is tony soprano also michael imperioli who plays christopher representing the younger 2030 generation in crime if david chase had not created this masterpiece modern tv dramas of such caliber may not have existed such as the wire and dexter so the sopranos is definitely the godfather goodfellas and pulp fiction of tv
2,ive probably been spoilt by having firstly seen the 1973 version with michael jayston and sorcha cusack so the 1983 adaptation is such a disappointment i just didnt get any chemistry between the main stars a lot of staring and theatrical acting just doesnt do it for me and what was all that about putting tim in the role of rochester had the casting director actually ever read the book very strange hes a fine actor but mr rochester he definitely isnt and zelah was just well strange bit of a mix matched couple in its favour the supporting cast were pretty good and the lowood scenes for me were the best of the adaptation but overall didnt capture any of the magic of the novel certainly wouldnt ask anyone to watch it as a true adaptation of the novel a real let down
5,this film lacked something i couldnt put my finger on at first charisma on the part of the leading actress this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play it could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors i just dont knowbr br but could it have been the screenplay just exactly who was the chef in love with he seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits than of anybody or anything else he never convinced me he was in love with the princessbr br i was disappointed in this movie but dont forget it was nominated for an oscar so judge for yourself
3,i would have rated the series a perfect 10 for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season 10 br br the final episode of the 10th season unending where it would certainly appear that the asgard have been killedoff in a very rushed unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion left me in disbelief br br from the extremely rushed end of the series its obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season my guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the stargate sg1 franchise for the two upcoming directtodvd movesbr br unless the asgard return in a future sg1 movie with a very good explanation of the apparent extinction i think that the fans have been cheated with a poor cleanup of looseendsbr br poor end to an otherwise brilliant scifi series
5,a sweetnatured young mountain man with a sad past henry thomas comes upon an abandoned baby girl in the woods and instantly falls in love with her the town elders generally support him in keeping the child though a local temptress cara seymour thinks little of the new family a determined little girl on a long walk and a sinister travelling salesman david strathairn at his creepiest have parallel stories which converge in a fateful way this is a charming sliceoflife in the ozarks in the same vein as where the lillies bloom  the dollmaker all three were shot on location in those beautiful hills and cover the lives of simpleliving  but not simpleminded  american folk a minimum of strong language and brief but pointed violence make this fairlysafe family viewing
3,some movies are repellent but still fascinating pulp fiction others are simply boring this movie has an almost unique feature of being both utterly repellent and totally boring by the end i didnt care about any of the characters i just wanted all of them dead so i could get out of the theatre
1,the movie started off strong ll cool j deed as an undercover police officer with partner sgt lazerov dylan mcdermott from the practice possibly miscast as a bad guy committing robbery and murder deed refuses to kill the drug dealer which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience the other big names freeman spacey et al are well cast and the movie shows promisebr br the movie begins to fall short as soon as justin timberlake pollack is introduced given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of timberlake i would choose the former even talented actors have to work hard at their craft timberlake is not talented and no amount of hard work can save him i would have thought he would put on a better show given the fact that he has been acting talented for years everything he did in this film was unconvincingbr br just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films even hardcore nsync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talentbr br that aside there are a few plot holes such as pollacks sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery this movie had so much promise thoroughly disappointing
5,without kirsten miller this project neednt have been completed however with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is miss miller i would definitely recommend it it looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance wagners dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing but his few scenes didnt detract from being entertained mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster the charismatic miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable she plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be i wish i had seen this on the big screen but alas i was fortunate to rent it before it was lost
6,im somewhat of a fan of lynches work so i was excited when i found this dvd unfortunately i was very let down its a series of short cartoons which attempt to show a disturbing and disgusting sort of humor the animation is very crude no doubt done using macromedia each cartoon has a big fat guy beating up his family and generally acting like a jerk to everyone he knows br br for people who are not familiar with this vein of animation they will probably be somewhat impressed by it however if youve spent much time on newgroundscom like me then these cartoons will be no different than any of the other stuff youve seen before many of the popular amateur artists on newgrounds are doing much better work than what was shown on this dvd if lynch submitted this work to the website then he would blend in perfectly with some of the better of newgrounds artists but since i saw this on dvd instead of on newgrounds i give it a 410 instead of a 710 as i would have otherwise these cartoons are fit for the internet but with a name like david lynch on it i expected better quality both in story and in animation
5,jameson parker and marilyn hassett are the screens most unbelievable couple since john travolta and lily tomlin larry peerces direction wavers uncontrollably between black farce and roman tragedy robert klein certainly think its the former and his selfcentered performance in a minor role underscores the total lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film normally i dont like to let myself get so ascerbic but the bell jar is one of my alltime favorite books and to watch what they did with it makes me literally crazy
4,jim carrey is back to much the same role that he played in the mask a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums and of course they have to be mexican obviously his good will towards his fellow man backfires in that case it wasnt too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums but i like that the movie suggests that things like that shouldnt be ignored im reminded of the episode of michael moores brilliant the awful truth when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay the results were not very promising so its nice to see someone in the movies setting a good examplebr br jim carrey plays the part of bruce nolan the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart or even better it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere a little metaphor that comes up when bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery thats seeking to bake the worlds biggest cookie hes desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the tv station but he loses his cool on live tv when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague you have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report needless to say he loses his temper on live tv in one of the funniest scenes of the entire filmbr br morgan freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the man himself displaying a god whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through freemans massive talent as an actor he is the kind of god who takes his job very seriously but in such a way as to advise his followers as well as the viewers of this movie that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life i love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day there are a lot of people in the world maybe more than our share in america who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humansbr br one of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewers religion i for example tend to reject organized religion in all forms and i see god and satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live but despite the fact that i dont believe that god exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time i was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this moviebr br jim carreys movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far hes come if you compare bruce almighty with movies like ace ventura both of which i loved by the way or a lot of what he did before he got into film its amazing how far hes come he has moved from cheesy tv comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like the truman show man on the moon and the majestic easily one of his greatest films ever jim carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working todaybr br jennifer aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie as she did in the sidesplitting office space as bruces girlfriend who becomes increasingly exasperated by bruces growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him there is definitely some lowbrow comedy in the film that doesnt really fit with the importance of the films meaning or the quality of the delivery such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene but it was definitely pretty nice to see ace venturas friend spike make a cameo appearance as stephen king very well knows its always nice to see familiar characters its almost like seeing family againbr br bruce is endowed with the powers of god for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him the thing i love about this is that like i said before religion is absent from my life but i was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things i would have done had i been endowed with such powers the movie allows us to learn vicariously this way which empowers the message even morebr br the scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film such as the scene when bruce loses his temper about the anchor position the jimmy hoffa scene who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records the scene where bruces rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera and my favorites the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakerys cooking the movie has plenty of time for carrey to deliver some excellent jokes such as when he says to god who reveals that hes the janitor the proprietor the electrician etc that his christmas parties must be real bashes and to be careful about drinking because on of him might need a ride home i also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes a little too true and as gallagher would add behind every great man is also an amazed motherinlawbr br bruce almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while and is probably the only directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious to buy on dvd to add to my personal collection it is a comedy written and performed in good taste but with enough relatively lowbrow humor to keep the kids entertained this is a meaningful comedy for the whole family which is becoming rarer and rarer these days in a world that is about to be flogged with yet another american pie film and another scary movie which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy its nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching dont miss this one
7,how wonderful yet another movie about america by someone who has visited here probably a half dozen times a day a piece and believes himself to be an expert on the country sheesh i should take a trip to germany for a week and then come back and make a movie about germany as the land of nazis or some such wim il boy you should get together with lars von trier and make the ultimate movie about the americans of course we all know it takes a pretentious leftleaning we are the world european to make a real movie about americabr br yeah right for a continent that started not one but two world wars europe sure has a lot of opinions about americas wrong foreign policybr br ps dont worry wim il boy theres plenty of ucberkeley americans thatll just love your movie of course these are the same people who thinks george w bush is worst than hitler and that a painting of a can of soup is sheer genius
0,i am black american and i loved this soap opera i watched it dubbed in spanish on telemundo almost 57 years ago the story was a true story about a black slave whos love affair with a white commander led to her leadership and candid whimsical way of livingbr br a lot of us could learn a lot from xica she took what she had nothing and saw her possibilities many would argue that she sold herself out  but she was trying to secure her future and that of her future childrenbr br it was such an excellent soap opera that i thought it would be released on dvd but its not being released this soap opera was the best soap opera ever we need for it to be released on dvd or broadcast on tv again its playing on azteca america right now which is only available in mexico or in the us by paid cable we need it released again to telemundo
0,masters of horror right to die starts late one night as married couple abby julia anderson  ciff addison martin donovan are driving home however while talking cliff is distracted  crashes into a tree that has fallen across the road cliffs airbag works ok  he walks away with minor injuries unfortunately for abby hers didnt  she ended up as toast when she was thrown from the car  doused in petrol which set alight burning her entire body abbys life is saved just she is taken to hospital where she is on life support seriously injured  horribly disfigured from the burns cliff decides that she should die his selfish lawyer ira corbin bersen thinks they should let abby die sue the car manufacturer  get rich while abbys mum pam linda sorenson wants to blame cliff get rich  save abby however abby has other plans of her ownbr br this american canadian coproduction was directed by rob schmidt whose only horror film previously was wrong turn 2003 which on its own hardly qualifies him to direct a masters of horror episode  was episode from season of the masters of horror tv series while i didnt think right to die was the best masters of horror episode ive seen i thought it was a decent enough effort all the same  still doesnt come close to being as bad as the screwfly solution 2006 the script by john esposito has a neat central idea that isnt anything new but it uses it effectively enough although id say its a bit uneven the first 15 minutes of this focuses on the horror element of the story but then it goes into a lull for 20 odd minutes as it becomes a drama as the legal wrangling over abbys life  the affair cliff is having take center stage before it gets back on track it a deliciously gory  twisted climax that may not be for the faint of heart the characters are a bit clichd the weak man the bent lawyer the protective mum  the young tart who has sex to get what she wants but they all serve their purpose well enough the dialogue is ok the story moves along at a nice pace  overall i liked right to die apart from a few minutes here  there where it loses its focus a bit  i wasnt that keen on the ambiguous endingbr br director schmidt does a good job  there are some effective scenes this tries to alternate between low key spooky atmosphere  outandout blood  gore there are some fantastic special makeup effects as usual theres shots of abby where she has had all of the skin burned off her body  the image of her bandaged head with her teeth showing because she has no lips left is pretty gross images  makeup effects that reminded me of similar scenes in hellraiser 1987  its sequels then theres the main course at the end where cliff literally skins someone complete with closeups of scalpels slicing skin open  him peeling it off the muscle  putting it into a cooler box very messy there are also various assorted body parts theres some nudity here as well with at least a couple of pretty ladies getting nakedbr br technically right to die is excellent the special effects are brilliant  as most masters of horror episodes it doesnt look like a cheap madefortv show which basically if the truth be told it is the acting was fine but theres no big names in this onebr br right to die is another enjoyable  somewhat twisted masters of horror episode that most horror fans should definitely check out if not just for the terrific skinning scene well worth a watch for those with the stomach
5,from what critics and audiences indicated birthday girl had to be a big fat clinker still because i love nicole kidman i decided to rent it last night it proved to be quite worthy of watching sure it isnt your basic american comedy and it doesnt take a genius to realize that it is a very british movie but thats why i liked it it was a change from all the other movies around a breath of fresh air sure there were some plot holes but overall it worked first off kidman was fabulous again in a very different not very glamorous but still quite sexy role she just keeps proving that she is one of the top talents in hollywood not only is her russian accent when she speaks english effective but there are times when she carries on long conversations in russian and if you didnt know it was nicole kidman you would never question her authenticity harrison ford should have taken note in k19 overall a slight little movie that works despite the horrible buzz
6,i am sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie rocked it is pure cg overacted crap dont send an assassin its much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored aggressive venomous snakes on a plane the only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to it is not so bad its good its so bad id rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again i honestly thought was going to be a comedy like airplane a spoof was i wrong its that whole it sucks get it or samuel a jackson yells snakes on the plane thing well im sorry i dont get it it looks like a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like triple x and die hard if you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought william hungs cd still live in their mommies basement and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn then rush to the theater and ask for one since i doubt you have a girlfriend ticket for snakes on a stupidbutt plane to hell with movies like full metal jacket pulp fiction true romance 12 monkeys clerks etc theres no irony in watching good movies the true decline of the western civilization calling this a cult film is an insult to true cult classics like repo man or even orgazmo ive said enough here
7,walking with cavemen hosted by alec baldwin is a look back at all the hominid thats us species of the past million years who they were what they were like and how they died out along with being a very interesting scientific look at the information we have on these species walking with cavemen also examines what it is that makes us human i waited several weeks to watch this and i was not disappointed
0,i cant believe that this movie even made it to video and that video rental stores are willing to put it on their shelves i literary asked for a refund take away the fact that the movie has no historical truth it and it is still the worse movie ever found in a video store it is not even good enough to be called a b rated movie do not waste your money or your time on this movie just listing to the voice over and the horrible music made me sick anyone involved with this movie should be pulled from the union gives the industry a black mark but after watching most of this movie i really dont think anyone involved is a union member
1,first of all this was not a three hour movie  two hours ten minutes last time i checked commercials arent actually part of a movie perhaps though it shouldve been a two parter for a total of about hours yeah would have gotten more in been able to explore some more emotion overall though it was an interesting look into the lives of lucy and desi i watch i love lucy from time to time and love it but never have i read or seen a biography never knew anything about their lives off the screen because of this movie i do now but im not so sure thats a good thing everything here no one really needed to know this was essentially a movie that didnt need to be made but it was made and the reason is because lucy  desi are still such huge stars and certain people in american society feel that the rest of society needs to know all about our tv and movie stars that is definitely so not true and very very sadbr br anyway what was shown here in lucy was pretty good two complaints  the actress who played viv vance  not great casting at all and the switch from madeline zima to rachel york uhhh like lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden shes a whole new person that wasnt too great but the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between lucy  desi no the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasnt necessarily a drawback to this movie because like i said this focused mainly just on lucy  desi had there been more time had the story been more about lucys entire life then maybe the kids woulda been there more but they werent so we got to see the likes of gable  lombard red skelton and buster keaton very briefly instead wow that was one thing about this story that i thought was really cool his presence and influence in lucys life really neat and its too bad that wasnt explored more oh well what was explored was done well for the most part honestly i dont think ill ever watch this again and i dont think this moviell be that memorable for someone who digs i love lucy but isnt an enormous lucille ball fan this should be an interesting watch my grade for this b
7,this movie was by far the worst movie that i have ever seen in my entire life im not even kidding it was poorly made and the actors couldnt act it was a waste of my time and money it looked like a movie that my friends and i could have put together on our own the case the movie came in is definitely a disguise nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case it appears that the director or makeup artist has just put black eye liner under someones eyes an called them a zombie the credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost 20 minutes of the movie which watching the credits was the best part of the movie this was honestly an awful movie and i couldnt believe how badly it was put together scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like whats going on the audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of teens joking around making a fake fight scenebr br if you are considering renting or buying this movie i would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it shows how awful it truly is i wish i would have watched it before i rented it
1,i like the good and evil battle i liked eddie in this movie better than any movie he has ever done he wasnt the smart cocky know it all he usually plays he shows heart and a more humble humor the fact that it shows there are stranger things in heaven and on earth than we can think of gives me hope
0,this was a well written tale of the making of the batman sitcom and actually reunites our heroes on a great quest as well as offers their tv shows history unlike the bradys and partridge family documentary movies we not only get a look into the past and present lives of adam and burt  but also get to see them back in action filled with kapows and catwomen and the riddlers batman is back ina well told  tale that not only gives us a satisfactory closing to the batman series  but fills the modern fan in on all the hollywood tales that about them that havent been heard in 35 yearsbr br kudos
4,this movies is the best movie to watch for comic book feel the sets costumes and the color are just so vivid it is just like stepping into a comic book this is the movie i think of when the mob is mentioned the suits the hats and the attitudesbr br hoffman gives comic relief as mumbles and you cant help but feel sorry for madonna as she tries and fails to win tracy over this movie contains all the classic mob clichs  burying people in concrete blowing up peoples cars tieing up the good guy and attempting to blow up his girlfriends housebr br this movie is a classic in ever sense of the word even camera angels cry out comic book its so great to be able to go back to an older movie and see that someone knew how a comic should be made into a movie after seeing such mistakes as spawn and the hulk br br you have to see this movie
4,camera work  why is the camera work in this movie so jumpy this is annoying and distracting editing  the flashes of the still pictures were way too short many of the other scenes were too short also just flashes sound  the background music was way too loud and covered up the voices one should not have to rewind and replay to catch what was said doesnt anybody check these things and make them do it over again please reduce the volume of the background music in future is adjustment of the relative sound levels the job of the editor julia wong the plot had way too many loose ends the basic story line had potential i think the film needed more work was it rushed perhaps they ran out of money like a lot of movies it started out great but just petered out toward the end i really dont understand this you know you have the story board before it goes into production so why doesnt all the loose ends get taken care of in the storyboardbr br sorry to be so critical
3,i had always been a big lynda carterwonder woman fan so when the scifi channel ran this moviei had to see iti was bitterly disappointedthis is a wonder woman movie in name onlyshe doesnt wear the right costume she must have refused to or had ordered major changes and the plot runs like a poor mans james bondtheres none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success ie the superhuman strength or determined willits just one long bad dreami dont even think cathy is all that attractive anywayi wouldnt waste your time on this
2,naturally i didnt watch gi jane out of choice i was more or less forced to watch this film round my exgirlfriends housebr br gi jane loses its credibility straight away by trying to convince the viewer that it is potentially a real scenario which of course it isnt the result of this is that the story becomes automatically bound by constraints restricting the amount of humour of which there is none or entertaining action scenes and soon becomes too serious the film therefore becomes extremely boring and predictablebr br gi jane fails where other action films succeed mainly because films such as james bond dirty harry and various others are larger than life yet never proclaim to be otherwise they are escapism and therefore entertaining gi jane tries to be real and failsbr br this is a very disappointing film from ridley scott with a very noncredible storyline unremarkable acting and the only reason i give it 210 instead of 110 is for some of the technical work
1,well i must say that this was one hell of a fun movie despite the fact that the dubbing was pretty cheesy and there were some odd moments where the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason i was not disappointed the story was actually pretty interesting the last member of the poison clan must track down the other five members and discover who among them is using their skills for evil and who is using them for good the catch being that during training all of the clan were masked and all have since returned to society in disguise and changed their namesbr br the fights are a joy to watch as each member of the poison clan has a different fighting style toad my favorite snake scorpion lizard and centipede the fight scenes have the actors jumping all over the place and thankfully the camera stays planted and uses a wide enough shot so you can clearly see all of the actionbr br the one drawback to the movie is that the story tends to drag a bit in the first half up until the first fight sequence but stick with it and you wont be disappointed
7,i saw this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from nyc after 30 minutes i said to him youve got to be kidding is this some sort of joke he thought it was good i told him that i thought it was probably one of the silliest movies ever made what was it supposed to be i asked a propaganda movie made for children the plot is stupid the acting is the worst ever for most of the principals and frankly people who look at this sort of tripe and think it has anything to do with life love or even afterlife of which it offers an incredibly idiotic viewneed some psychiatric help please if someone tries to get you to stick this in your dvd or video player consider it like you would a virus introduced into your computerit wont destroy your player but it will destroy your evening if they had made razzies in the 40s this would have won in every category ps it also goes under the dubious sobriquet of stairway to heaven
7,ally mcbeal was a decent enough show but it was very overrated the characters become boring after a while and the jokes begin to fall shortbr br i think it chose an appropriate point in time to leave  it was starting to outstay its welcome
0,how is it that everyone can understand each other perfectly without devices like universal translators or translator microbes did the creators of this show realize that people who were taken from different parts of the earth in different time frames attilla the hun wasnt a contemporary of preliterate hellenic cultures nor were the vikings contemporary to the pyramid builders speak different languages and can never develop a language so similar to modern day englishexcept for the inflections they do not use which has been influenced by latin ancient greek danish and french br br cultural differences cant be overcome so easily trust has to be won yet everywhere the team arrives they are welcomed without any suspicion and start ordering people around like they are their appointed leaders of course real fans would comment that they are perceived as gods the people they meet should be shocked by their technology and accuse them of witchcraft and the likebr br historical background none visually it might vaguely remind you of greek or viking culture but anyone can dress in a bunch of tablecloths or run to a local costume rental for a plastic helmet with horns and claim to look the part a smalltown theater group probably has better propsbr br boring another lame canuck production which inexplicably ran for ten long years as a kids show it could make the grade but anyone who has a little knowledge about human behavior and language couldnt bear to even watch the first twelve episodes of season like i just did i very much wanted to believe i had found a decent scifi show otherwise i would shut it of and cleansed my computer of this refuge after the first five minutes
7,by no means my favourite austen novel and paltrow is by no means my favourite actress but i found the film almost totally delightful paltrow does a good job and cummings stevenson and the one who plays miss bates are all absolutely terrific the period detail is not alienating the feel of the movie is just right in fact but the real find is jeremy northam as mr knightley there could not be more perfect casting imo i hated mr k in the novel but found him wonderfully human and humane in the film northams good looks and smiling eyes are no hindrance to enjoyment either highly recommended anar
6,i passed this one on the shelf a few times looking at the myriad of huge positive quotes with tiny names on the front and wondering if i was missing something the other night it was on one of the movie channels and i tuned in i missed nothingbr br i must admit that i only watched the first 30 minutes perhaps the movie becomes comedy gold after that given the slow plodding pace and complete lack of laughter in the first 30 i seriously doubt itbr br the lead character starts the movie in classic i dont know how to start my movie style with a long tiresome monologue about how he doesnt want to get sued its not funny its not even remotely funny others have commented on the san franclisco bit ok a small chuckle the first time he says it then he grinds it into the ground smiling at the camera like its the funniest thing ever written get over yourself in fact i think the talking to the camera bit was the reason i instantly disliked the film dont assume familiarity with your audience familiarity is _earned_ much like respectbr br from there you basically have a fat whiny guy talking in a very effeminate way about his dull life as a temp i didnt realize hes jewish its a discredit to jewish comedians to call this jewish humor its just unfunny humor just because youre jewish doesnt mean you have a knack for the comedy a wasp spalding gray does a better job of selfanalytical humor than this guy so obviously its not about ethnicitybr br if one of the bits i had seen had worked i might have stuck around but some schlub going on about how much he loves the names of the women he works with then listing them for five long minutes doesnt make a great moviebr br this is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of office space dont let yourself become a victim of target marketing just say no to haiku tunnel
6,with a well thought out cast this movie was a great comedic relief the plot is wellwritten and the cast was knockout every bit as good as the reviews suggested a rarity and was highly entertaining being a huge john candy fan myself this movie was no disappointment
4,i started watching the show from the first season and at the beginning i was pretty skeptical about it original movie was kind of childish and i was just looking for some scifi show while waiting for the bsg new seasonbr br but after few episodes i became a fan ive loved the characters  the notsostupidasyouthinkheis jack oneill the notonlysmart samantha carter the glorious tealc women and kids favorite and brilliant dr daniel jacksonbr br of course stories sometimes not serious sometimes even ridiculous but mostly its not about technology or space fighting  its about helping your friend even risking your life for him its about we dont leave anybody behind struggling to the end when all hope is lost about the free will and all good qualities that makes a human  humanbr br and now its breaking a record going 10th season and still doing good
3,without wishing to be a killjoy brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichd films ive ever seen  this being one of them and camp blood being another br br the acting is terrible the print is shoddy and everything about this film screams seriously you could do better yourself maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crapbr br i bought this for but remember you cant put a price on 71 minutes of your life youd do well to avoid this turkey even at a bargain basement price

6,standard paintbynumbers monster fare filled with a bunch of routine plot devices from bigcreature movies its like somebody had a deck of cards with plot ideas from other movies written on them which were shuffled and dealt whatever plot lines and characters came up in the deal were then tossed into the script br br characters are so clichridden that you can play a game of guess who ends up as a monster meal after less than ten minutes into the movie and probably get every single one rightincluding the order that they will get devoured many of the characters are so obnoxious that you root for the creature to shut them up some of the main characters include a billy idol clone who surfs with sharks a loudmouth brat who flashes bankrolls a capt ahab guy with a vendetta and ahabs girlfriend who does sleazy dances at a bar oh and a big big beast in need of anger management therapybr br along the way people argue a lot pretty girls run around with wet tshirts couples make out on exotic beaches explosions occur ruins of a shrine appear and greasyfaced pirates drop by br br amusing for the most part but one thing bothered me the callousness by characters when other people were killed after one violent demise they make oneliner jokes i could almost hear rim shotsbr br overall ok if you have 90 minutes to waste and you want to laugh at a sobaditsgoodmovie otherwise you may want to skip this one
0,say what you will about schmaltz one beauty of this film is that it is not proamerican it is a morality about some americans being called to high purpose and how they rose to the occasion it is inspiring because it is about people of noble purposebr br to me the most interesting part of the film is the education of fanny and david farrelly bette davis mother and brother as fanny says weve been shaken out of the magnoliasbr br in todays political climate where led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used 911 to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings we sunk to the level of the 911 murderers to seek bloodthirsty vengeance it cant all be blamed on mr bush  after all we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even reelected him after his lies had been exposed now with complete justification we americans are reviled throughout the worldbr br today we watch this film with a new awareness that the rise to power of nazis in germany was not due to a flaw in the german character but a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify our committing immoral and heinous acts im not comparing george bush to adolph hitler but i am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror hatred and hypernationalism to do despicable thingsbr br sadly the blackmailer who will do whatever needs to be done for his own agrandizement no matter how immoral is most like the leaders of our country those who support them and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand that they cant even be bothered to votebr br a film like watch on the rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be  a force for the betterment of humanity  and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goalsbr br geoff

0,i was very pleased to go and see a milanese film shot in milan alessandro alatri is a roman director who has understood properly and fortunately printed in a film the milanese philosophybr br film tells the story of a standard in career milanese couple starting from the birth to the death the birthwedding is so typical out of any scheme that becomes original and involves all the wedding guests in a flash back story of how the couple came to each other and felt in love life is hard in the urbe of milan and after the sweeties old days became tougher and tougher then finally the product a child who instead of strengthen further the couple relationship it weaken because the selfish effect typical of a nowadays metropolis personality the advertising environment with all the creative under stress atmosphere helps to get well involved in the plot we are losing the life values and this is well and deeply reflected in this nice and sharp movie from the senza pelles directorbr br the actors are well chosen stefania rocca nice and well characterised and a positive surprise an unexpected good fabio volo well known by the trash tv serie le ienebr br rating 710
0,you gotta love the cheesy low budget movies this one comes complete with bad effects props and bad acting really bad plus every time i see mercedes mcnab the sister i keep thinking watch out shes a vamp for those that know buffyangelbr br a perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and wants to waste money making a flick the little that was spent of course i dont know if i feel more sorry for the writer of the movie or the producer who didnt make back any moneybr br id say its good for little kids in its simplicity but i dont know if id want to subject a kid to itbr br umm110 because thats the lowest it will go
0,while a pleasant enough musical what stuck with me about this movie was the unexpected comedic chemistry between basil rathbone as the hasbeen composer and oscar levant as his assistant playing a high strung distracted artistic type a far cry from his more familiar roles as either menacing villains or the coolly logical sherlock holmes rathbones character looks like he couldnt find his way out of bed without help and that help is starbuck played with his usual droll humor by oscar levant upon hiring crosbys character as his ghost song writer rathbone introduces him to starbuck by saying he does all my thinking for me to which levant responds ah its only a parttime job of course this goes right past or over rathbone whos too busy fretting about where his next hit song will come from as another reviewer said who knew rathbone could be so funny too bad he didnt have more opportunities to display his comedic talent
1,lynch the man has some really great stuff he knows how to disturb us then reward us by getting us think in different ways this however is altogether different dumblands reward is absurd comedy earned by enduring 99 stupidity i may have laughed once but somewhere around episode i just started watching on fastforward didnt miss a thing i felt relieved when it ended and thats part of the point with this series its an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations rounded out with annoying animation voices and sound but recognizing this and its other absurdist qualities still fails to make dumbland worthwhile
7,apart from the usual stereotypes of the thirties eugene pallette as the gruff police detective jack la rue as the swarthy italian and of course james lee as the chinese cook this film is the great mystery of a murder in a locked room for an early 1930s film this step by step peeling of the veneer of the mystery is similar to the columbo series except in this film you dont have the advantage of knowing who the killer was in advance
0,spoilers spoilers if one were to review the film based on the premise alone one might think that you were looking at an average animal orientated horror flick the plot is as follows a group of documentary filmmakers head off to an island in order to film a documentary about surfing with sharks or blood surfing i live in south africa so it was released as blood surf admittedly this seems to have a somewhat interesting idea behind it which if it were explored further could have improved the movie somewhat however this is not the case as the blood surfing part of the movie is minimal due to the fact that their documentary is interrupted by a rather large saltwater crocodilebr br the script is absolutely terrible a good example of this is whenever someone gets eaten by the crocodile which is a frequent occurrence in this film no one seems to give a damn the most anyone person did in the film was to merely toast the victim in a scene which was meant to be poignant but just ended up being laughable due to the fact that the dialogue in this film was of a highly dubious nature another thing that really irritates about this film is the fact that they introduce characters who are totally superfluous to the film itself they introduce a bunch of pirates who can only be seen to be adding another 10 minutes to a mercifully short filmbr br the acting can be said to be mediocre it probably would have been a lot more impressive if they did not have such a terrible script to work from all in all there isnt one person who made a terrible impact on me every single person seemed to be a watereddown caricature and in this way not one of these actors made any sort of impact on mebr br the crocodile itself is said to be huge over 31 feet exactly and this sense of size is well portrayed by the obvious fake of a crocodile that they have provided for us in the film the crocodiles death at the end of the film is so ridiculously fake and contrived that it makes ones stomach turn with a huge cry of bravado the hero of the film announces that he has a plan which turns out be falling down a hill and getting the crocodile to impale himself on a luckilyplaced spike at the bottom of this said hillbr br all in all i would say that this film is one which has to be seen for you to believe how bad it could be what probably seemed like a good idea at the time suffered from a terrible script and an overwhelming sense of lowbudgetness which all served to create a truly awful movie
6,i really cant remember who recommended this but they said it was one of their favorite films it is certainly a strange one  like rubbernecking at a highway accidentbr br someone said that truth is stranger than fiction and the truth here is something to see i really cant understand how a fictionalized account of this documentary is to be released this year how can you improve on this the aunt and cousin of jackie kennedy remove themselves from new york society and hide in the hamptons in the process they become recluses and what is best described as crazy cat ladies they would have stayed hidden had not the city move to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by jackie this film was done after that rescue all during you couldnt help but think how bad was it before its a look at high society from the darker side and it is utterly fascinating
2,i watched speak easily one night and thought it was ok but missing something maybe buster keaton strangely speaking threw me off or the labored line delivery of a leading lady the next day i kept thinking about the movie though i couldnt get durantes song out of my head i kept trying to better remember thelma todds first scene i considered that maybe keaton did do some funny falls and physical comedy the next night i watched a scene with thelma todd as a conniving chorus girl trying to impress buster and jimmy with her sex appeal a very funny scene the actors excellent their faces their eyes their silly expressions so i watched another scene their show is opening on broadway buster in his blissful innocence botches every act again i was laughing out loud appreciating keatons clowning and tumbling so the next night i watched the whole movie again and this time i see it for the first time its stupendous its sensational its sublime three great comedians todd dances durante sings keaton speaks sure it aint poifectbut theres a lot of laughs in this picture
2,well this is the first post am ever commenting on imdb do you get it this movie has made me come and warn all the good souls who will stop ever experimenting with moviesbr br as most of them have given their comments i thought of watching this movie because it seemed to have some decent actorsthough having read worst critics against this movie i thought of experimenting it assuming it to be some comedy flick well it all started well with some ahem comedies then it all started going pathetic man you can believe your self you wud feel like going and banging your head each and every time the pathetic looking woman called the heroine of the movie is made helplesshuh well how much can a person digest a sick all possessive witch kinda ghost trying to do all she can to irritate you and stop you from what you are doingbr br the next worst thing about the movie is the zombie hero yes as he looses his fianc he roams around like a goat with black marks under his eyes and with the heros terribly stupid sister you wud be bleeding from head to toe if you attempted and succeeded by completely watching this movie
3,this film is terrible you dont really need to read this review further if you are planning on watching it suffice to say  dont unless you are studying how not to make a good moviebr br the acting is horrendous serious amateur hour throughout the movie i thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like michael madsen only to find out that it is actually him a new low even for himbr br the plot is terrible people who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before even by the standard of hollywood action flicks this is a terrible moviebr br dont watch it go for a jog instead  at least you wont feel like killing yourself
5,what a shame that a really competent director like andre de toth who specialized in slippery shifting alliances didnt get hold of this concept first he could have helped bring out the real potential especially with the interesting character played by william bishop as the movie stands its pretty much of a mess as asserted by reviewer chipe the main problems are with the direction cheap budget and poor script the strength lies in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept characters pulled in different directions by conflicting forces what was needed was someone with vision enough to pull together the positive elements by reworking the script into some kind of coherent whole instead of the sprawling awkward mess that it is try to figure out the motivations and interplay if you can also a bigger budget could have matched up contrasting location and studio shots and gotten the locations out of the alltooobvious la outskirts the real shame lies in a waste of an excellent cast hayden taylor before his teeth were capped dehner reeves along with james millican and william bishop shortly before their untimely deaths few films illustrate the importance of an auteurwithvision more than this lowly obscure western which in the right hands could have been so much more
1,i saw this movie when i was about 8yearsold and i liked it but it wasnt until i watched it again at the age of 13 that i really understood it for what it is a cartoon about a criminal dog with a real heart of gold adopts a little girl in order to exploit her for her talents to talk to animals the dog starcharlie b barkin is murdered by his formal business partner carface who is absolutely diabolical by the way his soul then goes to where else but heaven only to find a golden watch that is really his lifes time which charlie being the sneaky but lovable cad that he is steals and rewinds sending him back to earth once back on earth charlie goes about seeking revenge on the evil carface this is how he comes upon young annemarie the lonely little orphan that can talk to animals whom charlie plans to scam for her talents in order to get back at his enemy carface but scoundrel charlie actually comes to care for young annemarie and his plans unfoil as he must make up his mind to do what is right after annemarie discovers what her best friend charlie has really been using her to make money for a new and better dog casino now he must rescue her from the dreaded carface i still love this movie even at the age of 22 the idea and plot really are quite different and original from that of many other animated films i especially like the idea that a dog plays the role of the villain for once carface was even better than he was in the all dogs go to heaven sequel in that picture he appeared quite dubious to his role of villain
7,the movie starts quite with an intriguing scene three people are drinking and making small talk in a bar all of them are making up a bit outrageous stories as the movie unfolds it turns out that the most outrageous story is true however beyond that the movie is not very interesting except for the scene in the bar and the scene where main secret is revealed this revelation happens barely half time into the movie and frankly not much is left to be seen the rest of the time director is lingering in a god forsaken russian village full of pitiful and creepy old ladies sure these are fascinating and a bit shocking images but admiring them goes on way too long sacrificing any possible plot or character development i found this movie as another example of either lousy or lazy moviemaking where instead of trying to make an interesting story movie makers concentrate on weirdly fascinating imagery and through in a few almost unrelated stories case in point  meat traders story to leave the spectator to figure out all odds and ends on a surface it has artsy appearance but in this particular case is nothing more than lack of talent
0,steve carell comes into his own in his first starring role in the 40 year old virgin having only had supporting roles in such films as bewitched bruce almighty anchorman and his work on the daily show we had only gotten a small taste of the comedy that carell truly makes his own you can tell that will ferrell influenced his comedic air but carell takes it to another level everything he does is innocent lovable and hilarious i would not hesitate to say that steve carell is one of the next great comedians of our timebr br the 40 year old virgin is two hours of nonstop laughs or hours if you see it twice like i did a perfect supporting cast and great leads charm the audience through the entire movie the script was perfect with so many great lines that you will want to see the movie again just to try to remember them all the music fit the tone of the movie great and you can tell the director knew what he was doingbr br filled with sex jokes some nudity and a lot of language this movie isnt for everyone but if you liked the wedding crashers anchorman or any movie along those lines you will absolutely love the 40 year old virgin
0,when samantha eggar as phyllis dietrickson answers the door of her house swathed in a towel you realize that as competent an actress as eggar may be she doesnt have the hypnotic allure of barbara stanwyck and it is not entirely eggars fault in the original film wilder had stanwyck not only appear in a towel but she enters the scene on the second floor balcony of the house and she doesnt come out she appears almost as if by magic walter neff is staring up at her from below on the first floor there is a reason for this stanwyck is much higher than neff fred macmurray when they are first introduced it is not just the towel the towel adds to the seductive allure her pose is like a greek goddess overlooking her domain and in a strange way you feel as if from the start she is actually controlling the entire situation she has sexual even magic power this person is no ordinary housewife this person is a mystery with secrets hidden withinbr br back to 1973 the remake has crenna knock on the front door stanwycks standin eggar answers the door with a towel around her there is no appearance she simply opens the door the alluring superiority that grabs the audience at the first appearance of stanwyck in 1944 is entirely absent in 1973 she opens the door with a towel around her it may be sexy in a charlies angels sort of way but its not nearly as mysterious the filmmakers of the remake seem to misunderstand wilders point the script may have said phyllis appears in towel so the filmmakers of the remake simply follow the instructions and include the required towel the point is not the towel the point is the enigmatic quality of phyllis and the potential power she wields wilder gave her a towel to add to her mystique the filmmakers of the remake gave her a towel because thats what wilder did and in the choice of shot lost all of phyllis mystiquebr br richard crenna also seems miscast he seems like hes acting and not really in the midst of the dilemma part of the problem is crenna appears so much like a 70s actor he cant get into the 1940s when macmurray first speaks into the microphone sweat begins to drip from his face no sweat on crenna and they also changed one of the crucial lines at the beginning in the original neff says i didnt get the money and i didnt get the woman in the 1973 version crenna says i didnt get the money and i didnt want the woman did the filmmakers completely misunderstand the entire point of the story or were they dumbing it down for a television audiencebr br this madefortv movie is a bythenumbers rendition all the sharp edge of the original is lost the only standout maybe is lee j cobb in the role made famous by edward g robinson but he cannot save the loss of intensity of the original this 1973 boring remake is a forgettable tvmovie made probably by the same people who did gilligans island they might as well have tried to remake citizen kane or gone with the wind if mediocrity is the best one can hope for whats the point the 1944 classic is a film with a capital f this madefortv remake deserves an f grade or maybe a d for dumb
4,just had to write that one liner but it really is i love the gangster genre and this is the weakest entry ive seen in recent years  i have praises for everyone involved in most aspects except the most important one the script  it is a weak story about a petty criminal no amount of fine acting or black and white film styling can make up for a total lack of substance i love kevin spacey and i hear hes gonna do another film about the general my advice is dont waste your time
0,i went to school with jeremy earl that is how i heard of this movie i dont really know if it was in the theaters at all i dont recall the name i have seen it it is like one of those after school specials the acting is ok not great the plot was kind of weak and the lines were pretty corny so the only comment i can give this movie is eh i borrowed the movie from jeremy if i was in a movie rental place this is one that i would walk past and after watching it i wouldnt recommend it to anyone past middle school age ive also noticed that many times when urban kids are portrayed the slang is overused or just outdated many times i think thats what makes their characters unbelievable
2,i took part in a little mini production of this when i was a bout at school and my mum bought the video for me ive loved it ever since when i was younger it was the songs and spectacular dance sequences that i enjoyed but since ive watched it when i got older i appreciate more the fantastic acting and character portrayal oliver reed and ron moody were brilliant i cant imagine anyone else playing bill sykes or fagin shani wallis nancy if the best character for me she put up with so much for those boys i think shes such a strong character and her final scene when well you know always makes me cry best musical in my opinion of all time its lasted all this time it will live on for many more years to come 1110
1,i havent seen all of jess francos movies i have seen i think and there are more than 180 of them so maybe its a bit early to say so but necronomicon getrumte snden better known as succubus but that is the cut version is according to me if not the best certainly on of francos best franco is best known although known might be slightly exaggerated for vampiros lesbos a weird cultish movie that got more acclaim in the mid 90s when people found out jess franco was also an interesting composer through the soundtrack a happy few discovered the man and found out what was to be expected after seeing the video clip of the lion and the cucumber vampyros lesbos ost jess franco is an overwhelming director when the phone rang during vampiros i let it ring i just wanted to see more of the movie since that moment franco never could grip me that much but then i stumbled on this movie it is even better than vampiros lesbos i think franco is looking for what he can do with a story and a camera we find out he can do a lot i certainly didnt expect to find necronomicon that great its beginning didnt impress me at all remember i had seen vampiros lesbos before although chronologically that came only three years later and both movies kinda start the same but then the story went on puzzling and gripping beautiful camera work and the stuff you would like to see godard do if he werent so occupied with spreading his political messages later on in the movie i heard a dialogue about which art was or wasnt oldfashioned the man says that all movies have to be oldfashioned because it takes weeks before the audience sees what got filmed but the girl replies that bunuel fritz lang and godard yesterday made movies for tomorrow janine reynaud is an interesting lead actress and of course howard vernon a franco regular is also there luckily the acting is good something that can spoil a lot of franco movies for you but not this one but certainly watch out for the dummy scene the erotic tension the wild directing and the fact that its a yesterdays movie for tomorrow make it a movie a lot of people should see the fact that it is a bit more accessible than vampiros lesbos certainly helps
3,my favorite movie what a great story this really was id just like to be able to buy a copy of it but this does not seem possible
0,kolchak was a tv series that really didnt fit into any category part horror part comedy some social awareness thrown in and what we have is something that i think people werent ready for its a shame really as ive started to watch these shows on the chiller network i never saw the originals i realized how different and interesting it really was br br starring darren mcgavin as kolchak a reporter for the international news service and simon oakland as his always angry boss tony vincenzo the show followed the exploits of a chicago news reporter who more often than not became a part of the story himself as he searched the windy city for modern day creepies that go bump in the night the underlying charm of macgavin really sets the show apart a somewhat goofy guy who always wears the same suit you cannot help but love him his jokes are great and the back and forth between him and the skeptical editor oakland are downright hilarious br br the stories are for the most part pretty good and the acting is very good the 70s were not a great period for special effects and the show suffers for it but if you suspend disbelief what you have is a fun series that was ahead of its time
1,i am at a distinct disadvantage here i have not seen the first two movies in this series although i have seen a lot of larry cohen films fans of the series seem to think this is a good film judging it on its own it was pretty boringbr br you never get a real good look at the maniac cops robert zdar face but what i did see was pretty grim the death scenes seem to be staged to eat up the most film not to give any thrills maybe if i saw the nc17 directors cut i may be more impressedbr br the ending with the car chase with zdar caitlin dulany and robert davi was pretty intense best part of the movie
4,slow boring extremely repetitive no wonder the weinstein company did not buy this this spurlock should eat more mcdonalds while filming himself and quit producing there is no way you can watch this and enjoy the preacher is a joke the whole idea is not funny you can make a minute film with this idea not a feature i am so sorry i rented this movie i will never watch anything with the name spurlock on it it is completely garbage filmmakers like this should be on youtube and never be granted a distribution deal the film states that the american consumers and their shopping are at fault for the current depression when shopping and buying products making money circulate in the system are the base of a healthy economy
2,yuck and again i sayyuck the original version of this movie was a well directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory the original movie had a lot to say and didnt go out of its way to say it and it had a naked chick on a motorcyclebr br this version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest it looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be cute the movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance it is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wifebr br there was no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make me angry
6,if i didnt know any better it almost seems like it was staged but it wasnt it was set up perfectly and how they got all of that footage is amazing the unfortunate events of september 11 2001 are put together well in this documentary and the classic footage that they got made this an unfortunate classic just the history in the footage alone should make it a must see for any american or person touched by the tragedy of september 11
1,1st watched 832003  out of 10dirbrad sykes mindless 3d movie about flesheating zombies in a story within a movie chronicle and yes we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3d wow not that has been done time and time again in 2d in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesheating thats what made the original zombie classics good the flesheating was just thrown in as an extra were actually bored throughout most of this 3part chronicle because of the lametwilightzone like easily understood and slowpacingly revealed finales the last story is actually the story the movie started withhaving a reporter investigating a socalled ghost town and of course we get to see flesh eating zombies in that one as well well i think ive said enough watch the classics not this 3d borefeast
1,this film deserves another bad review consider one reviewer extolling the films virtues that include no sex violence or gore uh excuse me the very setup of the film has us watching as codys young comrade with love of life and who has everything to live for is blown to bits leaving cody holding his lifeless bloody body and given the nature of war we know that cody has seen horror on almost a daily basis so much for those viewing this film with such rose glasses that the violence which defines codys persona is erased from viewer memorybr br sans any family of his own cody like john rambo roams the country on his bike making the long trek to hometown usa in the guise of some place called nevada city no mention no realization of the clear fact that cody is damaged goods we know this since his co practically declares him so as he order cody to get some rest away from the death and destruction of war this explains as none seem to notice or care codys obvious flat effect it is not bad acting it is the flat effect of post traumatic stress disorder not guessing here remember his co ordered him off the battle fieldbr br how about that accidental kiss as noted by another review the fall was an accident the kiss was not how exactly was cody respecting faith by hitting on her knowing full well she was spoken for now that was a nonfamily value moment a moment which is then announced to the immediate universe as if posted on youtube of course faiths lapse of fidelity as well as codys coming on to a woman who plans to marry another is received in the spirit of the xmas season all cheering their cheaten hearts and lipsbr br we know little about faiths fianc except that she professes her love for him she takes no longer than a nano second to accept his proposal could have waited if any second thoughts he is generous he loves her to death the family has nothing really against him he believes marriage is based on compromises and the two have never discussed post marriage plans no evil doers herebr br asner is a fine actor given over the hill dialogue like we love you son you are part of our family literally days after they have met a stranger named cody and the band of brothers speech where the phrase was above all never intended to apply to virtual strangers off the battle fieldbr br bottom line this film is cotton candy xmas fluff that betrays itself in major ways most grossly when it applauds codys disrespect for faith by physically hitting on her knowing full well she is spoken for by redefining family as we know it to wit accepting a virtual stranger as a full fledged loving member of the family because we all love you how many of you have done that or know anyone who has done that not
5,if i had known this movie was filmed in the exasperating and queaseinducing dogme 95 style i would never have rented it nevertheless i took a dramamine for the seasickness and gave it a shot i lasted a very very very long forty minutes before giving up its just boring pretentious twaddlebr br the last french movie i saw was romance and it too was pretty dismal but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the necks of the characters all the time i am baffled at the continuing popularity of dogme 95 overseas  itll catch on in america about the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy its called dogme 95 because thats the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the camerabr br 
1,i wouldnt rent this one even on dollar rental night
7,the storyline is absurd and lamealso sucking are performances and the dialogue is hard to keep your eyes open i advise you to have a caffeinepropelled friend handy to wake you in time for a couple goreeffectswhy they bring alcatraz inin this casebecomes increasingly difficult to swallow all the while i wondered who this film aimed forchock full of lame subplots such as the cannibalism us armycaptainthis is lowgrade in every aspectbtw this movie is banned in germany
7,the first time i saw this i didnt laugh too much at the time i was only about fifteen years old and thought that maybe some of the deeper humor was too mature for me to understand at the time i had the same reaction when i viewed it a second time a few months ago and this time it was because felixs aborted suicide attempt at the beginning of the movie kind of darkened the movie a bit this scene made some of the things oscar said and did to felix later in the movie seem needlessly cruel and their personality clashes werent as amusing as they could have been had i not already known the story i would have been worried that some of oscars antics to felix might push him over the edge as it was it didnt make me laugh or smile like the television show with jack klugman and tony randall did still all in all a pretty good movie and it spawned one of the greatest sitcoms on television out of 10
1,inspector gadget was probably my alltime favorite 80s cartoon i enjoyed both the first and second seasons of the series as well as 1992s christmas special inspector gadget saves christmas some gadget fans are quick to criticize the second season 1985 of the show but they need to compare it to dics 2002 release of inspector gadgets last case claws revenge for then they will find the second season to be absolute goldbr br being a gadget fan i couldnt resist the opportunity to see the animated inspector gadget in something that wasnt gadget boyrelated i purchased the film and i swore to myself that id be objective i knew that sometimes artistic liberties would be taken from the original series i was not even prepared for what i was about to watchbr br there was barely a shred of the original show still intactbr br here is a short list of just some of the cons for this movie the humor is nonexistent from the original seriesbr br penny and brain originally having a nearly equal part in the series as gadget are missing from the action for fifteen to twenty minute intervalsbr br the original music by saban  levy is not there and the score that exists is subpar understood that saban has his own production company now but at least inspector gadget saves christmas had good music even without saban dont expect to see any of gadgets gadgets which made the show so endearing such as gadgetcopter gadgetbrella gadgetmalletgadgetcoat which actually was used but it was not even called the same thing as well as his standard other hat and hand gadgets in this movie his gadget legs were telescopic instead of springs that kind of stuff annoys true fans of the show and simply arent necessary to changebr br the gadgetmobile from the original series is now a fasttalking supposedly hip convertible all the fans from the original series enjoyed the gadgetmobile transforming into the gadget van and vice versabr br chief quimby is now very shorttempered and even mean to gadget he was always grumpy in the original series but this pushes the situation a bit muchbr br penny no longer has a computer bookbr br are there any positives to this movie ok here goesbr br maurice lamarche does a good job of taking over for the great don adams as inspector gadgetbr br in one scene chief quimby alludes to an actual villain from the cartoon series the great wambini classic gadget villain from the second season voiced by louis nyebr br looking for more redeeming factors for this movie well youre out of luck life is about making choices and living by those choices most situations in life have a purpose even if it is to teach a lesson the lesson learned here keep to the original formula if it aint broke dont fix it true gadget fans should steer clear from this movie you will surely be disappointedbr br hopefully dic and shout factory will continue to release more of the original series after the 2006 release of inspector gadget the original series volume containing the first 22 episodes of the series as a true gadget fan lover of 80s animation and many of dics programs i urge you the viewer to purchase inspector gadget the original series volume and inspector gadget saves christmas dvds which are excellent and sure to bring back good memories
7,i watched this movie last night and already i am struggling to recollect very much about it the story is about a group of criminals who escape from a space penal colony they fly to the moon in a spaceage dustbin carrier when there they terrorise the dustbin men who work on the moonbasebr br it strikes me that rubbish lowbudget scifi films often involve either desert planets or like this movie criminals escaping from penal colonies why this is i have no idea but i can say with some certainty that such films are always diabolical this one is really no exception it begins reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a halfway alright dance music soundtrack it then degenerates into a boring scifi thriller so little of consequence actually happens in this movie that i am literally struggling to write a helpful review so if youre reading this i apologise for not being able to enlighten you to the films subtleties and nuances for the record i recall a tedious bunch of baddies a tedious bunch of goodies some nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman other than that im strugglingbr br if you feel you could be interested in the activities of lunar dustbin men then i would not hesitate to recommend this film i would also recommend it to those of you who wish to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets
0,the first time you see the second renaissance it may look boring look at it at least twice and definitely watch part it will change your view of the matrix are the human people the ones who started the war  is ai a bad thing 
1,this show is terrible the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse i am one of those people who was never a big fan of corner gas but at least i liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them well at least corner gas was good at first little mosque on the prairie is typically awful bland cbc comedy that had nothing going for it from episode who are the people who are watching this show anyway i am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies maybe the jokes are for them and they work there i dont know a single person who likes this show and cant stand it myself the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in corner gas hopefully it wont last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being muslim which is different and couldshould have led to a great show
5,everyone does things that they later regret things that they wish they could blame on drugs or alien possession things that although seem rational at the time later reveal themselves to be engraved invitations for suffering and endless recriminations of stupiditybr br for some people it is signing the note for the new hummer for others it is picking up a homicidal hitchhiker for still others it is sending their bank account information to third world millionaires mysteriously strapped for cashbr br for me it was a filmbr br dwar dragon wars in hindsight i should have guessed how environmentally friendly and thoroughly recycled this movie would turn out to be from its stuttered and repeating title but with my willing suspension of disbelief intact and a naive faith stemming from the cool looking poster in the lobby i really wanted this film to work sadly by the time the old man in the pawnshop explained the entire backstory fifteen minutes into the picture i had the sudden sinking revelation that comes from knowing every plot point of a still unseen film and worse i knew just how badly every point would all suckbr br let me be perfectly clear here the english language lacks sufficient nuance and depth in the field of ultimate evil to properly describe just how bad this film really isbr br as for knowing all the twists of movie i was wrong in the spirit of the old godzilla films whose scales this one is not worthy to fill it conveniently sprouted extra subplots every time the main characters were threatened by the specter of meaningful dialoguebr br it was infested with close calls miraculous escapes and concentrated deposits of poorly explained angstbr br this film is what would happen if you gave the produces of the mighty morphing power rangers access to the national defense budget and lots of liquorbr br let me try to explainbr br imagine you could get a hold of all the coolestlooking set pieces from successful action movies of the last decade first take the rastatalking army of amphibians from star wars episode one and remove their prozac until they are ready to club navy sealsbr br next take close approximations of kira knightly and tom cruise you can even call him ethan as a subtle nod to the mission impossible franchise and give them lots of film noir narration so no one get confused while trying to follow the wadingpool depths of their thoughtsbr br finally add a raspyvoiced villain in pointy armor worthy of a lord of the rings yardsale and a couple of giant cobras angry at having their scenes deleted from latest edition of king kong and lay them all out in no particular order in modern day los angelesbr br now run to the drugstore to find something for your sudden migraine when you return puree these ingredients until any overlooked hint of originality is dissolved into a homogenized mass of cheese and serve semigelatinousbr br at several points during this picture i found myself saying out loud make the bad movie stop and breaking into tearsbr br to call this a bmovie would be giving it an undeserved promotion after summer school and a lot of physical therapy it might possibly pass for a c level film if you could somehow sleep through most of itbr br in short if you ever find yourself with money and brain cells to burn and the need to punish yourself for hideous unspoken sins against humanity dragon wars might just be the film for you
6,ok not bad movie making if it were from an original script but it is notbr br which part of in this story there are no women except for foulata and gagoola introduction by haggard did the producers directors and writers not understand i mean it is pretty plain english i understood it at age 10 the beauty of ksm is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds the colonial africa the unforgiving desert and kukuanaland a hidden and isolated kingdom that should be more than enough for even the most mediocre of producers to work with but nooo they have to throw romance into it pathetic suggestion to all you poor souls who actually thought this would be close to the book give it up until a peter jackson wannabe comes along and does it right you may as well keep rereading the tome btw there is a sequel book actually a prequel called allans wife it gives background to the story of quatermain it is a bit creepy but good
6,i simply love this movie it is a perfect example of the wellrounded surprising stories that come out of asian cinema there was a recent hollywood remake of this movie with richard gere and the simply awful jennifer lopez please do not confuse the two movies the original japanese film is touching subtle and wonderfully acted the hollywood version is the exact opposite i was aghast when i first saw the trailer for the remade us version and who was starring in it its typical hollywood unoriginal crass commercialism at its worst the remake cements the argument that some foreign films can never be improved upon the only reason the original film did not become more widely viewed is the us audiences aversion to subtitlesbr br one of the main reasons this movie would never work in an american telling is that the reserved ultra socially conservative character of the public japanese persona is at issue in this movie certainly the main character awakens to a more full understanding of living a vivacious life through dance but half of the movies tension comes from the stereotypes and ridicule ballroom dancers face in japanbr br please try to see this movie in its original form not the terrible full screen and please do skip the us remakeits a shallow travesty in comparison to the original japanese moviebr br yes i know the original movie is much older and this is simply a japanese take on the story but the only two people are likely to see any time soon are this one and the new us remakebr br speaking of foreign films ill make a few quick recommendations 1monsoon weddingi list this first for a reason outstanding film 2johnny stechinovery funny italian mistaken identity flic 3shiria korean action pic that mixes both asian flare  us style plot 4run lola runa german film that integrates its techno score ingeniouslybr br well just a quick list anyway 
1,when i saw this movie cover the first thing i thought was that it was made for video the second thing that came to mind was how similar this looked to another terrible movie darkness falls the tale of this dumb witch who killed people in the dark unfortunately darkness falls was quite the masterpiece compared to this pile of garbage and this movie should not have been madebr br the film starts off with a small back story for the witch or more like a pointless introduction of two little kids who are going to go meet the tooth fairy in hopes of her giving them a shiny new bicycle for their tooth the opening is filmed poorly and like the rest of the movie its certainly not scary in present time the movie is about peter lochlyn munroe peters renting out his house and his exgirlfriend darcy chandra west and her daughter cole come to stay there cole meets a neighborhood child and they talk of the tooth fairy and how you shouldnt lose your tooth or shell come for you unfortunately seconds later it looks like the tooth fairy steals her bike and knocks her tooth out how ironic will cole survive the wrath of the tooth fairy and will her mother and peter be able to save her and rekindle their romancethis is a bad movie you could probably figure it outbr br one of the main problems with this idiotic film is how undefined the tooth fairy is they say she kills you if you lose your tooth but nope shes more like a serial killer who kills at random and if you lose your tooth youre definitely going to go she steals a bike so apparently shes a thief too i said earlier that the idea for this movie was based on darkness falls but where did they get the inspiration for the tooth fairys appearance lets see she looks like a burn victim and she previously went around the neighborhood slaughtering children hmmmits almost as though shes an exact ripoff of freddy krueger from the nightmare on elm street films and this is not the worst part of this awful mess the climax is this movie might have the most laughable climax not literally laughable because i found it more sickening than funny ive ever seen dont see thisbr br just a little trivia lochlyn munroe was in scary movie and jianna ballard was in scary movie and they both were in this so apparently scary movie stars are forced to end out their career with bad scary moviesbr br my rating 12 out of  80 mins r for violence
2,another american pie movie has been shoved down our throats and this one is the worst one of them all it doesnt deserve the name american pie they should have stopped at the weddingbr br this movie feels like just a stupid porn movie which they slapped the title american pie on when i was watching this i felt like i was watching a different series it doesnt fell like american pie at all it has different humor and it is much more rude and has many more sex scenes then the other american pie moviesbr br i dont recommend it ever actually i dont recommend any of the american pie presents movies just stick with the nice original trilogybr br 210
2,a shame that even a talented director desplechin could not muster a decent performance out of a bleaklytalented actress phoenix esther kahn lacks the substance to convey a very concise and clear plot in an attempt to fulfill the concentric circle of an actors plight the performance and presentation is too contrived and poorly executed to draw any compassion from the viewer in an overly long running time the redundancy of esthers struggle is too melodramatic to be effective and reduces the storyline into a frail frame of a disastrous display the content is incoherent and gratuitous as phoenix struggles to carry out desplechins instruction just as esther is supposedly trying to do the same never feeling a convincing victory over esthers pain we never feel a victory in phoenixs talent
5,the movie has a good start portraying an interesting and strong shannon lee and introduces two very simpathetic side characters through the first half but later something happens and all the sudden shannon turns into this straight faced second hand bad girl and the movie gets lost in its own context the second half lacks any kind of charisma and is full of clichs bad acting a horrible plot and even worse stunt coordination not to mention the horrible actors they chose for the chechen mafia gangbr br game of death was bad and clownified bruce but his daughter tops it making an even bigger embarrassment of herself than the double who played bruce lee back then i truly believe that she can do much better than this and i hope she participates in a better production next timebr br if you are a real hard core action fan and dont care about quality go ahead and see this movie i was personally looking forward to it but just got terribly disappointed
7,still love it 17 or so years after the first time i saw it in fact i discovered that i had lost my copy of this and was very upset despite its nonassociation with the original which as a kid i never noticed and as an adult i dont care about this is what cartoons should be like just dark enough to be interesting and light enough to be enjoyed by everyone im more than glad that my parents raised me on this kind of thing rather than the cartoons we see today that teach our kids nothing the music is great and gets stuck in your head foreveri have downloaded the entire soundtrack at one point or another
2,i was dreading taking my nephews to this movie as i didnt think it was going to be well done the kids ages and 10 were set on seeing it so i caved i must admit that it was not nearly as bad as i had thought but was still a far cry from the book the movie seemed right on with the 10 year olds understanding and sense of humor i found that the year old understood what was going on and he was presenting solutions to the issues that were taking place i eventually had to explain that sometimes the movies dont show the best solutions to the problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make the silly or stupid choices
5,meryl streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous lindy chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby azaria chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense based on the book evil angels and titled so in its australian release a cry in the dark is an ugly film to watch it presents a scenario thats all too real for us in america the witchhunt against a person deemed an easy targetbr br lindy chamberlain was this woman being someone who spoke her mind someone who didnt play the sympathy card and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she didnt kill her own child the media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece and through it all lindy remained as stoic as ever even when her husband michael was falling apartbr br this stance of course is the power of strength as unsympathetic as it may look like and people happen to react strongly to that they want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn not sit there and look blank people dont understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations meryl streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold but not unfeeling woman one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty because of her sam neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair  someone has to or the chamberlains would be too detached and no one wants to see that except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the newsmedia theyll always eat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public
4,the film notes describe the main role family as turkish immigrants which living in denmark however it is so clear to understand that the fact is the behavior and the culture point the family is absolute kurdish similar social pressures and even cultural murders keep going on turkey today on kurdish ethnicity societies what a worrybr br it is widely accepted issue in turkey today the kurdish immigrants living in european countries today which have moved from turkey at 70s are culturally connected to the feudal moral laws system by growing daughters and women under pressure are giving harm to the turkish international image also as same as widely accepted another issue is the turkish or kurdish immigrants on these countries are the reason negative aim about the community europe nominee
4,theres tons of goodlooking women in this flick but alas this movie is nudityfree grrrrrrrrrr strike onebr br ahem one story in this film takes place in 1971 then why the hell are the main characters driving a kia sportage hello continuity anyonebr br as you might know this movie was released in stereoscopic 3d and it is the most hideous effect i have ever seen im not sure if someone botched the job on this but there was no 3d just doublevision blurs i didnt have the same problem with this companys other 3d movies hunting season and camp blood sure the 3d in those ones sucked too but with them i could see a semblance of 3d effectbr br this thing is a big ball of nothingbr br and whoever that women was who played the daughter of the eareating dame yum id like to see more of her in movies as well looks like janet margolin at a young age purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrbr br 
5,no one should ever try to adapt a tom robbins book for screen while the movie is fine and the performances are good the dialogue which works well reading it is crap when spoken or to put it another way no one would be likely to suggest that hearing someone elses name was like seeing it written in radium on a pearlbr br overall the movie feels like a badlyadapted cliffs notes to the book  most of the parts have been hacked down to a fifth of their size in the book in terms of backstory and current story and the ending is wildly and unpleasantly different from that of the book most of the plots from the book have gotten lost including the one that makes everything make sense at the end and theres more than one reference that makes sense in the book that makes the viewer say huh not a worthy effort unfortunately  the script should have been read compared to the book burned and all the actors sent off to do something far better i admire gus van sant tremendously but not even someone of his calibre could have made a decent movie of such a complex book without making a miniseries
2,i am a huge fan of vonneguts work and im very fond of this movie but i wouldnt say that this is a film of the mother night that i read when people say that vonnegut is unfilmable two things come to my mind one is that many of his themes are very near the knuckle or even taboo despite the accusation sometimes used against him that he chooses relatively easy targets for his satire this means less every day that passes as far as filmability is concerned directors these days appear to revel in breaking taboos and i have high hopes for the version of bluebeard now in production amazing to think that an innocent piece like vonneguts sirens of titan would probably have been the equivalent of r rated if filmed when it was published back in the 50s for its violence language and sexual and thematic content though its a tragedy that nobodys come up yet with a filmable script for it and in the present economic climate i also hope some director out there is looking closely at jailbird galapagos and hocus pocusbr br the other thing is his narrative style heaping irony upon irony upon irony but still making it hilariously funny it seems impossible to objectify and that appears to be the biggest obstacle to making great films of his great novels because the little authorial comments that colour our response as readers are just not possible in movies without resorting to too often clumsy techniques like talkovers vonnegut suggested that there was a character missing from filmed versions of his work himself as authornarrator to its credit breakfast of champions the movie tried to keep the comedy and came a bit of a cropper for its pains as did another turkey made from a vonnegut novel slapstick in an even more spectacular waybr br still theres nothing wrong with a director giving us his subjective interpretation of vonnegut and mother night is an excellent example of how as another reviewer put it a good director can add a visual poetry to a source like this but so much of the humour is lost that though its the same plot its not really from the same novel i read if it had been id probably have been rolling in the aisles laughing a few times watching it for a reader of the novel i think a chuckle even at the end is forgivable the end of the film however is truly poignant and i think one of the films successes is that it can genuinely leave you feeling that youve watched someone walk a razors edge between good and evil and the jury is still outbr br standing alone and of itself its well worth a look technically there are some minor but glaring errors notably in continuity and it too often looks drab and theatrical but most of the time it hits an acceptable note and occasionally shows considerable imagination and resourcefulness the acting in general is of a high order even if maybe the dialogue is by todays standards a little stiltedbr br it survives quite well watching back to back with slaughterhouse5 and there is actually quite a bit more good filmed vonnegut out there mostly versions of his short stories  harrison bergeron who am i this time and some other things like of course the misfiring filmed version of his very funny but disposable play happy birthday wanda june also there was an interesting piece  if it still exists done in the 70s called between time and timbuktu which vonnegut apparently didnt like much although he was involved in its production because he felt it misinterpreted him in its generality he said it reminded him of the bizarre surgical experiments performed in the hg wells tale the island of dr moreau but it did for many people serve as an excellent introduction to his workbr br but if the films dont make you want to go to the superior source material theyre not doing their jobbr br as the man said more or less the big show is inside your head

6,in the funeral of the famous british journalist joe strombel ian mcshane his colleagues and friends recall how obstinate he was while seeking for a scoop meanwhile the deceased joe discloses the identity of the tarot card serial killer of london he cheats the reaper and appears to the american student of journalism sondra pransky scarlett johansson who is on the stage in the middle of a magic show of the magician sidney waterman woody allen in london and tells her that the murderer is the aristocrat peter lyman hugh jackman sondra drags sid in her investigation seeking for evidences that peter is the killer however she falls in love with him and questions if joe strombel is right in his scoopbr br scoop is another great woody allens comedy outside manhattan actually again in london his ironic and witty lines are simply fantastic and i laughed a lot inclusive with his fate of hero in a country where people drive in the wrong side sid waterman is extremely funny and woody allen is in an excellent shape as comedian however his present muse scarlett johansson of whom i am a big fan has overacting and is annoying in many moments changing inclusive her accent to a histrionic pronunciation her character is absolutely silly and promiscuous and i was quite disappointed with her performance probably for the first time in her filmography but this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and worthwhile entertainment my vote is eightbr br title brazil scoop  o grande furo scoop  the big scoop
6,this one was marred by potentially great matches being cut very shortbr br the opening match was a waste of the legion of doom but i guess the only way they could have been eliminated by demolition was a doubledq otherwise mr perfect would have had to put in overtime kerry von erich the ic champ was wasted here and this was the third ppv in a row where perfect jobbed remember before that he never lost a matchbr br the second match was very good possibly the best of the night ted dibiase and the undertaker were excellent while the jim neidhart had one of his wwf highlights pinning the honky tonk man koko b ware continued his tradition of being the first to put over a new heel remember the big bossman and yokozuna this was a foreshadowing of bret harts singles career as he came back from twoonone and almost survived the match he and dibiase put on a wrestling clinic making us forget that the point of the match was dibiases boring feud with dusty rhodesbr br even though the visionaries were the first team to have all of its members survive and only the second since 87 to have four survivors this match was not a squash this was the longest match of the night and jake did a repeat of his 88 performance when he was left alone against four men and dominated i think he could have actually pulled off an upset these days the match would have ended the other way aroundbr br one of the shortest ss matches ever was also one of its most surprising possibly the most underrated wrestler ever tito santana was the inspirational wrestler of the night putting on war paint and pinning boris zukhov tanaka and even the warlord in the final survival match it was so strange to see him put over so overwhelmingly then go right back to his mediocre career sgt slaughter also did well getting rid of volkoff and the bushwhackers but that just wasnt a surprise tito wasbr br i think the only point of the survival match was to have hogan and the warrior win together at the endbr br this show was boring and the matches were too short the undertakers debut was cool but tito santana is the reason i will remember this one
0,i also having endured hundreds of childrens movies in the past consider this to be one of the worst i have ever seenbr br i resent in this day and age having to explain to my children that russia is not the bad guys also that mocking russian names like poopchev is inappropriatebr br the grandfather flys birthday party scene contained a quasisexist joke in which he implied that males drink beer and women talk on the phone two other flies also needlessly use the word crap twicebr br the whole movie largely smacks of 1950s stereotypes and propaganda that i thought we as a nation were proud to have risen abovebr br in all its just crude badly animated even more badly written and not worth wasting the time to view
1,if derivative and predictable raperevenge thrillers are your thing then youre in for a rare treat they dont really appeal to me so i couldnt find any single thing to redeem this peculiar tale it seems like something straight out of the 1980s a different age when this would have gone straight to video gillian anderson and danny dyer do ok work with a weak script and a tedious scenario but what is gillian anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as lady deadlock in the bbc tv adaptation of bleak house last year the director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a nearrape and by his work on documentaries but even thats not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural hounds beat up dyer i dont think i was the only person in the cinema laughing what i cant understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film  filmfour and verve pictures both have been involved in some great independent british films in recent years verve distributed bullet boy code 46 and red road  straightheads doesnt deserve to be mentioned in the same breath filmfour and verve take note is this really the best you can do what are independent british filmmakers going to make of your artistic judgement its a big blot on both of your reputations listen carefully can you hear the thousands of fans of independent british films crying in despair
0,sweet romantic dramacomedy about stewart and sullavan writing love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is naturally they work together and cant stand each other you can guess the rest its beautifully acted by the entire cast especially sullavan stewart and frank morgan has a witty intelligent script and looks absolutely stunning it takes place in budapest and was shot in hollywood but i found myself believing i was seeing budapest everything looks so perfect and dreamlike a one of a kind film dont miss it
2,i saw the film twice in the space of one week both times the at a cinema in orpington kent uk the place was packed both times and people had to be turned away from the start of the film with henry winkler getting injured on the football field the whole audience was in uproar with laughter laughter that lasted until the creditsbr br for those who love american wrestling this film is a must but be ready to see henry winkler as you have never seen him before also look out for a very well known actor whose trademark wrestling move is a headbutbr br if you get a chance watch this movie and it is family comedy entertainment at its best
6,i didnt really like this movie that much at all it wasnt really funny and in some cases it was just downright stupid rob schneider is definitely one enormously talented individual and while his acting was fine in this it just seemed like a real waste for him to star in i mean there were some parts that were okay and somewhat humorous in a cute kind of way but thats about it the only thing that actually caught my attention during this whole ordeal of over the top jokes was that there were some very good looking females present and im not one to watch a movie solely because of that but in this case it was the only nook where even the slightest case of redemption could be found all in all it was a couple notches below an average moviebr br final querybr br theaters so glad i didnt squander too much money on thisbr br dvd purchase ummm let me thinknobr br rental if you have a prehistoric sense of humor then why not
0,i feel like ive just watched a snuff filma beautifully acted taut engrossing and horrible thing a two hour litany of perversion in the most basic and all inclusive sense of the word sexual violence and torture rape decapitation incest corruption live burial and abuse abuse abuse no redemption whatsoever and i was entertained i couldnt stop watching what does this say about me about the people who make and act in this sort of thing and a world that has become so desensitized that eventually real snuff films will be the norm and im neither puritanical nor humorless i dont try to hide from the existence of darkness and i definitely have not led a sheltered life but i am ashamed of myself and im sorry to see my british cousins dragging the subjectmatter sewers the way my own tribe does it doesnt have to be cozy but does it have to wallow in vicarious sadism
0,somebody could probably make a great documentary about the jerry springer show but this fictionalized version merely succeeds in draining anything authentic and interesting out of the trashtv phenomenon there are dozens of famously bad movies eg manos the hands of fate that show more creativity and spirit than this dreary witless waste of filmbr br seriously why not a documentary about the jerry springer show that would begin to answer some of the real questions like who are these people what happens to their lives after they appear on this show how did the mayor of cincinatti find himself herebr br one good line during an orientation session for guests people i cant emphasize this enough no weapons
4,imagine that i was about to miss this great cultural event on swedish tv last night and it was only because my girlfriend insisted on keeping the tv on to make it easier for her to fall asleep that i came across it yes i had seen an advert for it previously but of course forgotten about it and looked forward to an early nightbr br anyway  this must surely be a rather unusual idea  to base a film documentary on an interview made with sound only more than 30 years ago but with animated and other documentary film material it adds up to a really good and insightful portrait of one of the 20th centuries most appreciated literary artists  georges remy aka hergbr br i for sure will read my tintin albums with a different eye after having seen this film which makes it easier to connect the variations in style as well as content with the different periods in hergs life and i can tell you that i will asap get the few that i dont have of course my perception of the albums has changed over the more than 25 years that i have already been reading them as has my view about what albums are my favourites but this adds at least one more dimension to them
0,this adaptation positively butchers a classic which is beloved for its subtlety timothy dalton has absolutely no conception of the different nuances of rochesters character i get the feeling he never even read the book just sauntered on set in his too tight breeches and was handed a character summary that read grumpy broody murky past he plays rochester not as a character or as a real person but as an over the top grouch who never cracks a smile until after he gets engaged at which point he miraculously morphs into a pansy there is no chemistry the only feeling that this adaptation excited in me was incredulity and also sympathy for charlotte bronte who is most definitely turning in her grave go and reread the book rochester has a personality and by the way a passionate love scene does not mean you have to eat her face
0,im 14 so you probably would think i have never heard of george burns or walter matthau or anyone like that boy are you wrong i had heard that george burns was in this movie and that he won an academy award for it i have been a fan of george burns since i was ten i saw the movie oh god recently and loved it this one was also very awesome george burns did a great job so did walter matthauthis is the first time ive ever seen him perform and even though they had really small roles phyllis diller and steve allen did a good job that special they were filming would have been awesome if it was really done let me say this if you are a fan of george burns or walter matthau you should see this movie right away
1,leslie charteris series of novels of the adventures of the slightly shady simon templar the saint was brought to the screen in the late 1930s with the up and coming george sanders as templar it was a careful choice  sanders usually would play villains with occasional nice roles ffoliott in foreign correspondence the title hero in the strange case of uncle harry the framed best friend of robert montgomery in rage in heaven here his willingness to bend the rules and break a law briefly fit his heavy persona while his good looks and suave behavior made templar a fit shady hero like chester morris boston blackie and to an extent peter lorres mr moto br br the films are not the best series of movie mystery serials  but they are serviceable like rathbones holmes series or olands chans series the show frequently had actors repeating roles or playing new ones the antiheroine in the film here was played by wendy barrie who would show up in a second film in the series this and slightly familiar movie sets make the series a comfortable experience for the viewers who hear the buzz of the dialog always showing sanders braininess in keeping one step ahead of the bad guys without noting the obvious defects of the plot all these mysteries have defects due to the fact that even the best writers of the genre cant avoid repeating old ideas again and again and againbr br here the moment when that happened was when one of the cast admitted his affection for barrie which she was long aware of shortly after he tries to protect her from the police but as the film dealt with the identity of a criminal mastermind it became obvious that this person was made so slightly noble as to merit being the mysterious mastermind ie the script disguised him as the least likely suspectbr br barrie is after the proof that her father who died in prison was framed by the real criminals in a robbery gang she has several people assisting her  mugs like william gargan  and she gets advice from the mastermind on planning embarrassing burglaries that cant be pinned on her the da who got her father convicted jerome cowan is determined to get barrie and her gang the only detective who seems to have a chance to solve the case is jonathan hale who is shadowing sanders but reluctantly working with him br br the cast has some nice moments in the script  hale currently on a special diet is tempted to eat a rich lobster dinner made for sanders by willie best he gets a serious upset stomach as a result enabling sanders and barrie to flee sanders apartment best has to remind him when he feels better to head for a location that sanders told him to go to at a certain timebr br there is also an interesting role for gilbert emery usually playing decent people like the browbeaten husband in between two worlds he plays a socially prominent weakling here  whose demise is reminiscent of that of a character in a bogart moviebr br on the whole a well made film for the second half of a movie house billing in 1939 it will entertain you even if it does not remain in your memory
3,my cable tv has whats called the arts channel which is a catchascatchcan situation sometimes sometimes films sometimes short clips of films or ballets and i came into this just as the bar scene came on where they tear up their coupons excellent exquisite ealing wins again my wartimeglasgowraised mother would love this should i ever find a copy of it some of britains best artists from mr holloway to wayne and radford and the delicious miss rutherford having a wonderful time gently sticking it to the home office loved the last scene where as soon as they are back in england the temperature plummets and it rains
3,based on the personal experiences of director john singletons time at the university of southern californiacomes higher learning a film centered on the racial politics that occur at modern day collegesbr br there are three main characters to which the film bases its foundation around for its story malik williams an carefree lowbrow athlete who is an african american male kristin conner a sheltered soft white girl and remy a unsophisticated unconnected white male all three are overcome by the sudden realities that college life is not as good as it is advertised as all three go through disappointment by being unprepared malik by being naive kristin and by being unwanted remybr br one good thing about the film is that it does show that modern american colleges are just high schools writ large the colleges are not places to build character  develop potential or enhance personal advancement but they are institutions used to gather all sorts of students in a onesizefitsall atmosphere it is an experience that usually is built for failure for most students it would have been good if the film built it story about this travesty rather than racial politicsbr br but it didnt and thats where the films falls apart singleton it seems had a pretty bad experience at southern california through this film he lets it all hang out there is no need to beat around the bush here singleton lets the heroes and the villains of this piece be easily seenbr br the black characters in the film are pretty much seen as the heroes here while all the whites in the film are seen as the villains save for kristin who was raped by a fellow white studentbr br who can understand the inconsistencies of this film black gang members who come to the aid of a white girl after she points out to them who supposedly raped her the ease that the black gang members have at the university while a bunch of skin heads meet in a dark small dorm planning violence br br the performances of omar epps malik and kristy swanson kristin are disappointing they do seem like the third choices for the roles that they played in this movie tupac shakur and drew barrymore were supposed to play malik and kristin but were unavailable oshea jackson aka ice cube busta rhymes and regina king were all irritating in their respective roles and laurence fishburne was woefully miscast here as the history professor only michael rappaport did well in this film and he did considering that his character of the three main characters changed the most in the filmbr br john singleton wanted to take on the matter of race and inequality in american college life with this film and he did so quite badly it was sort like killing a fly with a shotgun life is far more complex than it seems and people are alike all over and he should know this higher learning is proof that he did not understand this at all seeing the film then and now would only confuse disappoint and enrage the same public he would wish to speak to not to mention it would not entertain them in the slightest
5, here be spoilers br br the government has continued to develop the universalsoldier program now called unisol the soldiers are now stronger and are able to take more damage than before however the government is downsizing the project endangered and the supercomputer that is in the middle of all feel threatened so he takes steps to ensure his own safety he activates and controls the unisols and start to run mayhem the only one who can stop them is deveraux van damme br br this movie is about one thing choreographed fighting the story is bad and is soon drowned in all fights whatever happens and wherever they go they fight unfortunately for this movie it is no fun watching a fight where you know one part of it is indestructible normally youre pretty sure the hero will win but you still want to feel the fights are between two somewhat equal combatants not where one is indestructible and cant lose then the fights just become a tool to stretch time you wait until the final fight when deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unbeatable foes to further lower my opinion a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how much scantily clad women there are well there arent really that lot of them because the characters are most men there are at least one woman unisol though but almost every woman is needlessly shown with at least just a bra once the female leads get by with this but we also pass through a stripclub to use a computer no less with much more undressed women these moments do not give anything to the story and is just there to try to please the adolescentminded male audiencebr br so in conclusion boring fights no more no less well maybe lessbr br 210
0,this movie gets it right as a former usaf aviation cadet i can tell you this movie has it all the tedium of the application process the waiting for word the joy of acceptance the worry about making it through the course the sorrow of watching ones buddies perhaps the best of themwash out the anguish of paying the ultimate price  the death of fllow student airmen the glory of graduation always the flying the flying the flying many are called but few are chosen we did for pay what we would have eagerly paid to do
7,what a boring film to sum it all up its was basically just nana patekar beating up his daughterinlaw karisma kapoor while she tried to flee from the village with her son can someone say boring the concept wasnt too bad but it was poorly executed the canadian locales and some of the village scenes were nicely shot however overall the cinematography came up short the story could have been great but the movie just seemed to drag on there is only so much stupidity a person can take let alone three bloody hours of itbr br the best part of the whole movie was the song ishq kamina and that was only five minutes long other than that this movie was a piece of crap
1,the movie has one nude scene a man sitting on the edge of the bed with his exposed genitals smack dab in the middle of the screen it is quite a long scene what was the point i almost think it was meant to be funny but we were watching it with my mother and it wasnt funny to have that staring at us for what seemed like a full minutebr br the movie is cold none of the characters are even likeable audrey tatou is cute of course but her character is an unhappy girlbr br i really would not recommend this movie i had expected it to be charming and fresh but it was depressing i wondered if the director was from a very upper crust educated french family and he looks down on these charactersbr br 
2,the first 30min of the flick was choppy and hard to know just what was going on unless you read the book  which i had notbr br if you can stick with the first half the second half is sweet  predictable yes but sweet nonethelessbr br the way it was shot one would think it was produced in the early 80s not 2005br br no standout moments bland but it moved along without boring mebr br i would like to know why keaton selected this role her part would have been better cast with a player more at the level of the other actors to keep the balance
4,this film was released the year i was born and will be like me 70 in 2007 i watched it again last night having not seen it since high school while it was full of 30s sentiment and the acting was a bit stereotyped nevertheless it was superb pearl s bucks story did come alive through the magic of the chemistry of luise rainer and paul muni the novel which earned ms buck the nobel prize for literature comes alive under the baton of sydney franklin which along with an excellent script recounts the story of peasant farmer wang lung whose father obtains a bride for him a slave girl from the kitchen of a local landlord in bucks story wangs success is underwritten by his willingness to listen to his wife most of the time and the love of the land in the end he comes to realize that his wife like the land is the source of his wealth happiness and immortality bucks stories always had strong women cast in a critical spot to influence the outcome of events in the prefeminist world the germanborn luise rainer brings a tentative but determined peasant chinese woman to life in her portrayal of olan muni likewise captures the naive but honorable wang eventually caught between the two worlds of the wealthy and the peasant other classic characters include charlie grapewin dorothy gales kansan uncle henry from the wizard of oz walter connelly as the mewing conniving uncle and keye luke as number one son but this time not charlie chansbr br a classic might be defined as a movie you can watch time and again and never tire of if thats indeed the case this film is a classic no doubt whatsoever
6,growing up with the beast wars transformers i wasnt very familiar with the original transformers and now that i have seen the awesome movie and now that i have seen the older cartoon on which its based i have to say i like the original cartoon and the live action movie more than beast warsbr br not that i dont like the bw characters i just think that characters like optimus prime are better than optimus primalbr br i mean autobots transform and roll out sounds a lot better than maximals maximize the voice of the original optimus prime still makes me a strong believer that hes a real commander more so than optimus primalbr br besides powermaster optimus prime is a lot more powerful than optimal optimus just look on the web br br megatron in the bw character seemed more like a humorous version of the more evil version of him in the original seriesbr br besides whats cooler robots changing into animals or robots changing into vehicles and spaceships gimme the original transformers any day over beast wars
0,i loved this movie i totally disagree with some negative critiques that ive read over the years this was a great vehicle for eddie murphy he appeared to have a great time with his part as chandler jarrell and he should never care about what the critics say if he had fun doing it  and most of his audience enjoyed it and it was fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with mr murphys great comedic style you have to keep in mind that golden child is a fantasy film  just an imaginative work of magic and wonder amidst the real world during the time this film was released i was working in a video rental store this was one of the most popular with all our customers every single time we put this one up on our monitor all the copies we had went out fast with waitlist requests that kept it on the queue for months everyone who rented it loved it i was the resident film critic and all my regular customers would ask my opinion before they rented  this was one of my favorites and i knew the taste of my customers so i highly recommended this one to most of them i really feel that this film is a sleeper  it may not have done too well at the box office  due to very poor marketing  but it hit a high in the video rental and purchase market later yes i did buy this film for my own video library i adored the little boy who played the golden child  j l reate  but after looking at his profile in imdb i noticed that he never did any more films that is sad because he definitely had an onscreen aura and could have continued with a film career i also adored victor wong who played the old man i loved him in his part as egg shen in big trouble in little china  1986 at any rate this was a great film the only drawbacks that didnt seem to fit with the theme were some of the parts that got a bit more adult in nature  such as chandlers rather sexual remarks about the serpent lady that was presented to him as a silhouette it was funny but it still was out of sync ok so there were a few suggestive gratuitous scenes  those were put in for the mindset of the day perhaps this was still an adventurous and escapist type of film which we do need today to get away from all the hard core reality and depressing fluff that we are hit with from hollywood now thats entertainment
0,this is one of disneys top five animated features in my opinion cinderella was a perfect return to the fulllength feature animation film as opposed to the compilation films of the 40s and expensive depth via the multiplane camera returns to the film in no other way although disney adapts the story somewhat liberally you gather the idea of the era via the dress and set stylizationsa clear time period the story takes placebr br cinderella is more mature than snow white and a multidimensional character actually all of the characters are somewhat welldeveloped except for the princeleft the most flatwe know he has a sense of humor and a great smile but thats about all like snow white disney has some permanent impact on the story in popular culturein most versions of cinderella the stepsisters are attractive just not as pretty as cinderella and their character takes away from their otherwise nice appearancebr br favorite disney additions the mice also appreciated the continuitycinderella always loses her shoe throughout the film the addition of the homemade gown as well as the following assault from the stepsisters was always horrific as a childi remember view master showing this with a black background and a large red light on it the broken slipper shows the unwillingness of evil lady tremaine to give up her hold over cinderella and admit defeataudley would go on to characterize the most wicked of all disney villains satanic witch maleficent in sleeping beauty
3,some people have made a point of dissing this movie because they question the plausibility of black people in the old west asian people in the old west or women with guns in the old west period get a grip and read a book there were quite a few asians chinese there were quite a few blacks freedmen and everybody outside of the gentile class had ready access to guns it is the second amendment you know and as far as the use of modern language goes none of those westerns people have waxed nostalgic about actually used language that was consistent with the era depicted americans had different accents used different inflections spoke at a very different pace and used plenty of words and phrases that would be unrecognizable today dont blame historical inaccuracy for the fact that you just didnt dig it be honest maybe youre just uncomfortable with what youre seeing
5,first off i have no idea how this movie made it to the big screen its not even the low budget scifi channel movie its just awful me and my friend who love action movies independence day jurassic park lotr etc went to see this movie expecting this movie to me a transformers with dragons mindless entertainment all we got was a mindless hour and a half the cg was not as bad as i was expecting but the plot is so awful along with the acting it made up for it its basically a chinese legged of dragons returning every 500 yearssounds like a good remake of rain of fire no the plot tries to be deeper than it should be leaving not only plot holes but with magic and a very small actual war between dragonsrather big snakes it just gets ridiculous the director attempted to add a bit of humor in the movie which fail me and my friend laughed through the whole thingalong with all of the audience and cant believed we spent money on this the short trailer on tv makes up for most of the action while crap makes up the rest ive seen a lot of b movies like reptilian the cave spider and others but i have to say if you want a non stop laugh for an hour watch thisbr br story 110 cg 510 acting310br br i dont drinkbut it would have helped before watching this movie
3,tremendous blackandwhite nighttime cinematography and plenty of it highlights this supposedlytrue life account of a 1950s murder in kansas in which an entire family was wiped out by two menbr br the story was written by truman capote so you get the very liberal antideath penalty message at the end of the film which is ludicrous knowing the facts of this case robert blake and scott wilson play the two atheist losers who have twisted outlooks on life and who unnecessarily murder this nice family br br despite the annoying slant at the end this is a riveting story from the start and the cinematography makes this even more fascinating famed photographer conrad hall did a fantastic job on this it makes me wish more modernday films were made in blackandwhite see it on dvdbr br blake wilson john forsythe jeff corey and the entire supporting cast are excellent in here my third viewing of this film came in early april of 2005 shortly after blake in real life was pronounced innocent in the murder trial of his wife one cant help but look at blake and this film differently after that
0,many people judge it as a fan service film because a lot of super star starring in this movie gackt hyde and wang lee hom is very famous singer in japan but dont judge it before you watch is what i say gackt and staff are very serious when made this film and they worked so hard its a good film with a touchy story inside several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad they made it so good until i cant stop watching this all over again br br the story has written pretty well but i admit that their act are little disappointing this is especially for hyde because his skill of acting is under from the other and it is weird to hear the way when he speaks with other language except his native language japan but its comprehensibility because this is their first time to act in the moviebr br i think gackt trying to show us about how someone can be so weak when they lose the most important person in their life when toshi was killed when sho asked kei to turn yiche to being vampire like him because he wont let her die when shos brother died kei shoot son die and the best and beautiful scene is when sho pass away even i told that hydes skill is still weird but i give him two thumps up at that scenebr br theres a time where the plot goes too fast like they didnt tell the reason why son can join the local mafia and being shos enemy because they are a good friend at the past and also son is shos brother in lawbr br whatever i love this movie very much  br br this is an action movie with a touching beautiful story
7,an unqualified 10 the level of writing and acting in this australian movie is reminiscent of the very best of old hollywood sam neill and meryl streep are very good together neill matches streep line for line and take for take  it is one of the best showcases yet of his prodigious acting talent and he is at his sexy and gorgeous best notwithstanding the intensity of his role this engrossing film is a treat for any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom drama portrayed in the most human but unsentimental terms the movie  which won several top awards in australia  boasts not only a superlative cast and director but wonderful and authentic australian locales it proves that people are the same the world over and after all these years people still delight in repeating the famous streep line accent and all a dingo ate moy baby including that imp elaine benis on seinfeld
0,this is a great movie some will disagree with me but  if you know anything about the bible you know it is i think everyone should see it i agree a new updated version like be nice but the message is still right on if you can see this movie is not a scare the hell of you movieit is truthful with the bible i think the u n will play a major role in the world government to come the last days are lining up with the bible look at what has happened with the chip for dogs and cats that now has come to light to protect on children from being kidnapped its the size of a grain of rice this i feel is the fore runner of the mark of the beast spoken of in the bible without the mark you cant sell or buy with this chip that small in the future there is no telling how much info can be put on it
6,dolph lundgren stars as a templar who comes to new york when a key that unlocks the antichrist is found by an archaeologist of course the demon is only a couple miles behind dolph and isnt killed so easily as he transfers from body to body like fallen without the suspense of course lundgren is out of his element and the movie is completely unwatchable i admit to being a fan of dolph lundgren like steven seagal and jeanclaude van damme i try to watch his movies whenever theyre on tv i caught the minion and boy was i ever disappointed this movie is utterly terrible with action sequences so poorly staged and badly edited you can barely make coherent sense in the fight arena worst of all is lundgrens woefully unconvincing perf as a tough guy priest  all of this made worse that the movie is such a rip off of fallen which was good and end of days which was bad but better than this overall this movie is the worst movie ive seen from dolph lundgren it literally has nothing to recommend it its awful and its the lowest point in lundgrens career and i saw coverup the last warrior and masters of the universebr br 12 out of 4awful
6,i can hardly believe that this inert turgid and badly staged film is by a filmmaker whose other works ive quite enjoyed the experience of enduring the lady and the duke and no other word but enduring will do left me in a vile mood a condition relieved only by reading the imdb user comment by ali112 for not only has rohmer attempted with success to make us see the world through the genre art of 18th century france but as ali has pointed out has shown at the cost of alienating his audience the effects of both class consciousness and the revolution it inspired through the eyes of a dislikably elitist woman of her times the director has accomplished something undeniably difficult but i question whether it was worth the effort it took for him to do so  or for us to watch the dull results of his labor
1,in short this movie is completely worthlessbr br the idea is to make movie from the point of view of what someone from the early 1900s might think of the future an interesting idea but the lack of compelling story or characters prevents us from ever suspending our disbelief so the idea just flopsbr br apparently the whole movie was done with actors in front of green screens and we are supposed to be impressed but as a graphics person the over softening was an obvious crutch for hiding the difficult sharp edge problem with green screening the color is majorly washed out to no relevant effect except reduce the visual quality and i dont understand why anyone would consider anything rendered in this movie to be in any way ground breaking if anything the ridiculous retrograde graphics have lowered the bar for really bad graphics  they dont measure up even to the ancient jurassic park graphics the models for the robots were so simple plain and very uncompelling there were a bunch of weirdo prehistoriclike animals on that island but they are not explained in any waybr br the story is horrible beyond belief in fact i cant believe i didnt just walk out of this movie the relationship between polly and joe is unmotivated and throughout the movie is based on distrust and deception why is the morris paley character even there we are not in any way convinced that joe is heroic  i mean he flies a plane and saved one person polly for personal reasons yeah theres a great hero for you dex has very little screen time so why are we supposed to care about joe wanting to save him who were the nepalease that locked joe and polly in the mine vault and why would they do it remembering that the entire totenkopf operation was roboticbr br plot holes why did bai lings character a major fall from her excellent character in the crow halt the robots who had captured joe they were looking for the vials and had not found them why in the hell would dex be captured but not killed he doesnt have or know about the vials and the bad guys didnt know that polly had the vials and was connected to joe and therefore to dex polly indicates that they dont know anything about totenkopf yet she has some secret source about him that contains what appears to be a fairly complete fbistyle file on him the blank spot on the map as described by the nepalese  if they know all about this mysterious area then why the hell is their map blank in that spot at one point polly and joe have to give up their clothes they are burned  joe is given new clothes that were identical to his old clothes yet polly is forced to wear some very odd looking bulky dress then in the same line of continuity suddenly polly has her original clothes backbr br sigh how far off am i supposed to switch my brain to watch this crapbr br we are supposed to be exhilarated by the over produced music even when nothing interesting or remotely exhilarating is happening on screenbr br and the acting were supposed to be impressed with a bunch of bad british accents which character isnt annoying i think ling bais dialogue was probably the best in the whole movie she doesnt have a single line the dialogue wasnt camp and doesnt even rise to the level of cheese its just bad and annoying these people arent heros or compelling they are the kind of people you would try to ignore or disassociate with if you ever had the misfortune of meeting them in real lifebr br i cant believe that this movie gets an above average rating here on imdb imho it should be competing with batman forever in the bottom 100 of all time
1,i have no clue as to what this was shot on but you can definitely tell that they had no budget bad acting horrible cinematography and lame plot and some decent special effects do not make a good movie the wwf style cinemtography will make you crywheres the tripod the filmakers aimed high but sorely missed their mark
2,dick tracy is one of our familys favorites  the actors are great  the art direction is exceptional  the music is magic its not supposed to be to kill a mockingbird  its a fun experiencebr br stephen sondhemims songs are stellar back in business is energetic sooner or later is just right what can you lose is haunting  even tunes like live alone and like it add to the storybr br got to love the giddily overthetop performances of al pacino dustin hoffman glenn headly charlie korsmo mandy patinkin james caan dick van dyke supporting villains the list is far too long and yes  even madonna and warren beatty are awesome written with a smile a minute how many times have we looked at each other and said wait a minute  im having a thought  its gonebr br however one of most telling things about in this film is that everyone involved seems to be having a good time  and that above all adds to the enjoyment for the viewer so if you havent already why not give dick tracy a chance  accept it for what it is  a sunday comic strip brought to life  and in a wonderful way
6,some guy gets whacked right out in plain sight this other guy shoots him hes got some bodyguards and they whack the killer but a reporter gets interested she goes to the hospital where they took the guy who got whacked she walks in and corners one bodyguard but he doesnt feel like talking i cant figure out why its not like anyone else is interested shes the only reporter there anyway her editor discourages her from working on this lame story but hey she does anyway she goes to see the killers sister  mom a few minutes after she leaves they get whacked big time somebody blows up their trailer huge ball of fire then she searches out the bodyguard from the hospital she finds him hungover on his boat but a minute later theyre both underwater sucking on a scuba tank cause three guys are trying to whack them and have blown up the boat big time huge ball of fire the reporter and the bodyguard whack two of the guys who are trying to whack them br br in the course of the next hour another guy gets whacked crossing the street theres a shootout with several stiffs in a warehouse some car chases with wreckage  death a fake suicide etc etc lotsa stiffs all kindsa carnage br br great stuff but what the reporter and the bodyguard cant figure is why in hell the original guy got whacked whats the motivation of course it might help us to figure out why the reporters even interested through almost all of this shes the only reporter on the story nobody else in the media cares not even with all the big fireballs and dead bodies true the original guy who got whacked wasnt exactly a celebrity his job was a little bit dull he was just the president yeah the one who lives in the white house oh and the bodyguard is a secret service agentbr br is that the spoilerbr br it should be after all there are no tv cameras no other print reporters no bloggers just another one of those police blotter crimesbr br so whats the spoilerbr br lemme thinkbr br no wait the spoiler is that his wife did it yeah the first lady she was ped because the president was fooling around and she gets away with it shes really sharp huh but how the hell could anybody ever figure that out why would anyone bother after all only one reporter is even interested br br i give this move a it was so dumb i just had to keep watching and it only got dumber thats the real spoiler but even though ive told you youve got to see it to believe it
0,i know that originally this film was not a box office hit but in light of recent hollywood releases most of which have been decidedly formularidden plot less pointless savetheblondechicknomatterwhat drivel feast of all saints certainly in this sorry context deserves a second opinion the filmlike the bookloses anchoring in some of the historical background but it depicts a uniquely american dilemma set against the uniquely horrific american institution of human enslavement and some of its tragic and funny and touching consequencesbr br and worthy of singling out is the youthful robert richard cast as the leading figure marcel whose idealistic enthusiasm is truly universal as he sets out in the beginning of his coming of age only to be cruelly disappointed at what turns out to become his true education in the ways of the southern plantation world of louisiana at the apex of the antebellum period when i saw the previews featuring the dreaded blondhaired richard i expected a buffoon a fop a caricaturei was pleasantly surprisedbr br ossie davis ruby dee the late ben vereen pam grier victoria rowell and even jasmine guy lend vivid imagery and formidable skill as actors in the backdrop tapestry of placage voodoo creole aristocracy and haitian revolt woven into this tale of human passion hate love family and racial perplexity in a society which is supposedly gone and yet somehow is still with us
0,quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathombr br a group of top quality actors in the main well cast with a couple of notable exceptions who give pretty good performances penelope keith is perfect as aunt louise and equally good is joanna lumley as diana all do well with the scripts they were givenbr br so much for the good the average would include the sets nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book although bizarrely the house they use for the dower house looks remarkably like it it is clear then that the dower house is far too big in the later parts the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the uk presumably to save money although with a little imagination i have no doubt they could have recreated ceylonbr br now to the bad the screenplay this is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it edward does not die in the battle of britain but survives blinded he makes a brief appearance then commits suicide  why loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with gus to a sensible farmers wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear less emotional than brief encounter gus a man besotted and passionately in love is prepared to give up his love without complaint walter mudge in the book turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who wont speak aunt biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification the dower house is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with jess who has a fear of armed soldiers whilst miss mortimers breasts are utterly delightful i could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward the delightfully named nettlebed becomes the mundane dobson the word limit prevents me from continuing the listbr br there is a sequel which i lost all interest in watching after this nonsense and i wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story it is difficult to image that rosamunde pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased
0,lorenzo lamas stars as some type of cia agent who captures some exotic beauty named alexa kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former employers oj simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not so talented ensemble i must admit im not a fan of lorenzo lamas or his movies he stinks however when compared to oj simpson and lamas comatose wife kinmont lamas seems like ah jeanclaude van damme i only saw cia because of the renewed interest around the oj simpson trial you see because if your parents had cable and the extra channels you couldnt escape this movie in 1994 you could go to an amish community and some moron would have this playing in their portable tv the movie itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intrigue although the shock value of oj simpson jumping after fireballs and exchanging would be one liners do provide some unintentional humor also where was bobby knight and kobe bryant to make this a complete camp classic br br  out of 4bad
6,i dont see much reason to get into this movie in much detail sylvester stallone is once again john rambo author and survivor of a season in hell recruited from prison by his only friend major richard crenna to secretly return to vietnam take photos of the american prisoners believed to be still held in horrible camps and return without engaging the enemybr br fat chance what if he actually did nothing more than sneak in take pics and sneak out who would come to see the movie br br its essentially a celebration of stallones muscles preparing for his mission we see his welloiled muscles bulging they are oiled and bulging throughout there is the ritual strapping on of black leather ugly guns and even uglier knives the black guns are cleaned assembled with loud clacks and almost as oiled as stallones muscles the bow is tested and yes it has enough poundage to drive a bolt through an enemys forehead the knife is sharpened with slick snicksbr br stallone and one of his pows are betrayed by one or two of the suits from washington cynical politicians who you can bet were never even in a fist fight in grammar school no guts you know just sit around with their feet on the desk and drink foreign beerbr br the movie does what it set out to do but what it set out to do is meretricious it deliberately cashes in on the myth popular in the mid1980s that there were uncountable numbers of mias quietly kept in wretched camps by the north vietnamese the bumper stickers were ubiquitous free our mias why would they keep them it was never quite reasoned out but perhaps to turn the pows into a slave labor force  in a country that has absolutely no resource other than labor or maybe for their propaganda value as an instrument to humiliate the united states  a propaganda weapon that the vietnamese kept secret from the worldbr br as a captive rambo is treated in a medieval fashion by the north vietnamese dipped to his neck in pig excrement and then hauled out of it by his wrists his muscles still on display then not content with subhuman vietnamese a russian officer is brought in to play the part of the gestapo officer  vee haff vays of making you remember a hightech type the russian uses psychology and electricity not just pig dumpbr br rambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until this country loves us as much as we love it bringing up another myth that vets returning from vietnam were uniformly spat upon and cursed which is why i guess we elected so many to the congress and appointed others to highechelon positions the last three losing presidential candidates were among that despised group at least rambos aimless drifting left room open for a sequel which arrived apacebr br the action movies with schwarzenegger and willis and others were leavened by wisecracks but rambo is humorless it marches dully through its phantasmal ideological swamp killing without mercy barely speaking barely able to speak to speak is a sign of weakness
2,for those looking for a sequel for the fine south african miniseries of the 1980s this isnt it nor is it a historical drama rather it is a dreary little fantasy which has nothing to do with the historical shaka but merely uses his name to give a certain cachet to sinclairs idiotic story about an african superhero who is a combination of jesus lincoln superman and nelson mandelabr br on the other hand there are a few laughoutloud moments as when shaka breaks the cross to which he is chained and kicks some serious slaver butt you know like jesus would have done if he hadnt been such a wimpbr br true i saw only the 98minute version but i cant imagine that twice as much of this crap would have been betterbr br and what kind of a name is mungo
1,this film was really bad whether you take it as a scifi movie as a horror one or even as a comedy the whole thing is ridiculousbr br the film looks and is definitely cheap the actors have no idea of what acting is and the script shows clearly that it was being made along with the shooting it is obvious that the monster in the closet was added because the living head was not scary at all she was even pretty and they thought they needed something more impressive they failed here too the make up is awful even for the late 50s rather funnybr br the film shows clearly why director joseph greens career as such and also as a writer never materialized he was really bad at both same goes to the actors leading and supportingbr br the brain that wouldnt dies best achievement is its short running time
7,this along with hare tonic ranks as one of the best bugs cartoons indeed one of the best bugs ever there are some comments about how bugs in these cartoons is basic meaning i guess that he is as yet not fully developed i actually prefer this basic version from the mid40s chuck jones was the best version who is actually more rabbitsized and far more amusing than the eventual longlegged version who towered over yosemite sam and daffy duck the latterday bugs came to be too suave and sophisticated for my liking also check out hair raising hare 1946 and rabbit punch 1948 for great examples of classic bugs and classic chuck jones
0,this warning against antisemitism is wellmeant and may have had its purpose at the time but it is made without the slightest notion of how to make a film the director has no idea about miseenscene the cast varies from bad till even worsebr br the great austrian comic hans moser is wasted in his part he ends in an asylum for the crazy that is designed as a set from das kabinett des dr caligari one wonders whether the makers had all their mental capabilitiesbr br the restored copy i saw dutch filmmuseum gives the impression that some scenes were not put into the right place but may be the original editing was bad as well
0,in an era of such awful cartoons i am rather in shock to see a movie with such good morals make it to the imdb bottom list for animated moviesbr br this movie does contradict the first i wont deny that however when i was in the target age group for this movie i didnt even notice nor would it have mattered if i did the people who made it may have used new generation to note that this is another way the care bear family could have began perhaps we are meant to decide for ourselves how the care bear family truly beganbr br this was my favorite movie at age 36 and it did not scare me or confuse me at allbr br 
2,i wish i could say that this show was unusual in its banalitybut it is usual in every wayit has the dumb husbandhis smarter but boring and conventional wife along with the idiotic sidekick for comic reliefit sorely needs itstale predictable jokes with even more predictable reactions from the laughtrack punctuate this noxious mental narcotics nauseatingly unimaginative plot lines to leave me either physically ill or in a deep sleep more resembling that of an induced coma but it might be on for a while yet because it gives the average american a personage to which they can truly identifya regular guy just like you and mei live in the southern us so to me this show is just the opposite of escapismdown here that obnoxious character is everywhere in some form or anotherseeing him on television is brutal overkill
7,the movie was to be shown here in bangkok with all the fanfare and even in the theater it failed miserablybr br apparently the story writer just dont hold water something was definitely missing in my opinion people must have a reason why they watch it other than historical glimpse of the past accuracy of history is not what we look for in entertainmentbr br the movie just lack any substance the only way to do this movie right was somehow make changes where it stands as some kind of a legend instead of just a story and a legend will have certain elements that tries to tell you something that people have forgotten through time such as the meaning of sacrifice nationalism etc it is called the central themebr br the movie fails to answer why would i watch it anywaybr br at least some strange legendary flying elephants psychic king or the eccentric king such as the king and i would have been lovely something would have added greatly to the movies appeal i guess there was no appeal other than a plain vanilla movie br br once you got the appeal then the story is the next thing we concentrate on in marketing terms we call it must see upon hearing the title of the movie people would say oh i must see it now wheres the appeal in kingmaker why not just redo the title and call it how not to be a king and make a black comedy of the old siamese days to the style of dr strangelove that would have been much more interesting narrativelike experiences of the foibles of the king from first persons goofs off would have made the movie extremely funny br br most movies today have that must see appeal such as spiderman men x these titles speak for themselves if they dont have familiar characters some other movies such as the island had an appeal itself when the advertising asks do you still believe there is an island br br or for the movie retitled how not to be a king might ask the question so do you still want to be a king br br parhat
5,was this the greatest movie that i have ever seen no was it the worst nobr br as a mother of four kids it is nice to watch something that was light and amusing it was great but it was cutebr br i think that it definitely had some room to improve but it triedbr br i am not sure if this movie deserves the extreme level of abuse from the other reviewer they obviously do not care for eva longoria i think that she was better in this than in the sentinel i think that movies are a matter of opinion the actors play a huge role in whether it is a hit or a flopbr br maybe the cast did not work out maybe there were too many things going onbr br i just wanted to speak up for an average movie not a terrible one it could just be a chick flick kind of like the movie the splitup or french kiss my husband still talks about those 
1,having just seen the a perfect spy mini series in one go one can do nothing but doff ones hat  a pure masterpiece which compared to the other le carr minis about smiley has quite different qualitiesbr br in the minis about smiley it is alex guiness as smiley who steals the show  the rest of the actors just support him one can saybr br here it is ensemble and story thats important as the lead actor played excellently by peter egan in the final episodes isnt charismatic at all br br egan just plays a guy called magnus pym who by lying being devious and telling people what they like to hear is very well liked by everyone big and small the only one who seems to understand his inner self is alex his czech handlerbr br never have the machinery behind a spy andor traitor been told better after having followed his life from a very young age we fully understand what it is that makes it possible to turn him into a traitor his ability to lie and fake everything is what makes him into a perfect spy as his czech handler calls him br br and by following his life we fully understand how difficult it is to get back to the straight and narrow path once youve veered off it he trundles on even if he never get anything economic out of it except promotion by his mi5 spy masters everyones happy as long as the flow of faked information continues br br magnuss father played wonderfully by ray mcanally is a nogood conman who always dreams up schemes to con people out of their money in later years it is his son who has to bail him out again and again but by the example set by his dad and uncle who takes over as guardian when his father goes to prison and his mom is sent off to an asylum magnus quickly learns early that lying is the way of surviving not telling the truth at first he overdoes it a bit but quickly learn to tell the right lies and to be constant not changing the stories from time to time that he tell those who want to listen about himself and his dadbr br his czech handler alex expertly played by rdiger weigang creates with the help of magnus a network of nonexisting informants which supplies the british mi5 with fake information for years and years just as the british did with the german spies that were active in the uk before and during the war  they kept on sending fake information to das vaterland long after the agents themselves had been turned liquidated or simply been replaced by mi5 menbr br the young lads who play magnus in younger years does it wonderfully and most of them are more charismatic than the older little more cynic and tired pym played by egan but you buy the difference easily as that is often the way we change through life from enthusiasm to sorrow or indifferencebr br indeed well worth the money
6,this show is good i like the acting funny bits and the cuteness of it the actors lee pace ann friel etc they all did great in the show the show started off great with its funny illogical basic idea of bringing dead people back in the first series and honestly as what people said the first few episodes of the second series were a bit of a let down but it later came back looking good anyway and now i really hate the fact that its going to be cancelled why doesnt abc just let it finish until the very end when all the episodes are already done i really wanna know how the storys going to be i think it should be given a chance as therere still so many viewers who love it
5,a truly horrible film that left me feeling sullied by having watched the forty minutes or so i could stand not the actors fault but the writerdirector producers financiers etc need a very stiff talking to maybe it thinks it is profound it isnt this rape and ultraviolence unlike that central to clockwork orange has nothing to say about or add to the sum of human understanding its no straw dogs either to which i have seen it compared rather it feels like something pete walker might have turned his hand to yet even in saying that im probably being a bit unfair on pete walkerbr br revenge is a powerful human desire but the bedroom window has more to say about that and male emasculation than this pitiful effortbr br i dont think its particularly misogynistic merely too gleeful in its depiction of certain details  the blood running down gas leg post rape par example its neither challenging nor confrontational though im sure the filmmakers consider themselves very daring just deeply unpleasantbr br is this as high as we can aim is this why those involved wanted to make films  i did write in here the latin phrase which translates as oh the times oh the customs but the new spellcheck on imdb wouldnt let me post until i had removed it likewise i had to remove square parentheses get it sorted imdbbr br where is the lofty aspiration the noble impulse when you look at british film  the joyful comedies of ealing or the boulting brothers carol reeds work with graham greene on fallen idol our man in havana or the sublime the third man a film which has far more to say about evil than a thousand straightheads the work of powell  pressburger or if you want to talk about sex violence and male emasculation look at the offence dir sidney lumet from an original play by john hopkins check out tunes of glory for something worth making that has something to saybr br unlike the foregoing straightheads is alas an altogether hateful waste of celluloid
4,i am completely appalled to see that the average rating for this movie is 5210 for what affects me it is definitely one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i still keep wondering why i watched it until the end first of all the plot is totally hopeless and the acting truly awful i think that any totally unknown actress would have been better for the role than susan lucci concerning mr kamar dels reyes i think it would have been a better choice for him to remain in his valley of the dolls to sum up it is total waste of timeand im trying to stay polite to avoid at any cost my rating is and i still think it is well paid but since we cannot give a o
4,this movie was extremely funny i would like to own this for my vintage collection of 1970s movie must see again list i know this cast of characters they are people that i have met over the years and that prompt me to search out this comedy unfortunately this was never put to dvd or vhs redd foxx always a clown of comedy pearl baily a great match as his wife witty and sassy norman a son with a secret not sure if he will have a future if it is outdennis dugan crazy funny man  miss dobson hooker with a heart and little conscience loveluststrange family ties this movie qualifies for a come back encore performance situation comedy with a mix of events as this could and should find its way as a remake i do think finding cast would be extremely difficult maybe impossibleexcept jerry seinfeld playing dennis dugan role this earmarks a couple of seinfeld episodes that also brought me back to norman is that you keeping them in the closest was surely impossible as impossible to reform pretend hooker girl friend and infidelity of a parent this movie was a wild ride advise of a cabbie remind me of episode kramer takes advice of his caddie over his lawyer  episode from seinfeld  the parents have there jaw dropping moment fun over fun it is screaming bring me back 
6,darkwolf tells the tale of a young waitress named josie samaire armstrong who had been leading a pretty ordinary life until her friend mary tippi hedren is killed by a werewolf you see werewolves actually exist in modern day america  there is even a special organisation within the police force to fight the werewolf threat headed up by detective steve turley ryan olosio who has the difficult task of telling josie that she is in fact a pure blooded werewolf herself  that a socalled dark prince werewolf kane hodder wants to mate with her  create a new breed of pure blood werewolves that will take over the entire world or something like that understandably josie has a hard time believing it that is until she sees the evidence with her own eyes its up to werewolf cop steve to save josie the day  the worldbr br coexecutive produced  directed richard friedman i thought darkwolf was a pretty bad low budget shot on a digital camcorder horror film that didnt really do anything for me the script by geoffrey alan holliday starts out promisingly enough being set in a strip club with plenty of naked breasts on show  then theres a werewolf attack which leaves someone splattered everywhere but after this decent opening sequence its pretty much down hill all the way im afraid for a start its slow going its dull its predictable  its populated with highly annoying characters who come out with lots of bad dialogue  do stupid things like when they have the opportunity to shoot the werewolf they dont i have no idea why but they prefer to just stand there instead the script is dumb  doesnt explain itself why has josie never turned into a werewolf before is she really the only one why cant this dark prince find another female werewolf there are also lots of other things which make little or no sense like an ancient book which at fist seems quite important but is then totally forgotten about halfway through but you get the idea anyway as a whole the film plods along in very linear fashion to a very predictable climatic showdown that is underwhelming to say the leastbr br director friedman lights the film quite well with bright neon but this is noting new or original  doesnt really improve the film as a spectacle now lets talk special effects or rather the lack of them because the effects in darkwolf are far from special the werewolf transformation is achieved using cgi  its among the worst looking cgi ive ever seen seriously a playstation would be embarrassed about these computer graphics its easily the worst werewolf transformation ive ever seen an american werewolf in london 1981 was made over 25 years ago yet the special effects in that are literally lightyears ahead of the ones seen in darkwolf who says special effects have improved over the years the animatronic puppet effects arent much better either although at least theres something psychical on screen the gore isnt up to much after a gory opening kill theres some blood splatter  plenty of dead bodies but not much else thres a fair amount of female nudity if thats your thing but dont get too excited because you still have to sit through a terrible film to see it is it really worth itbr br technically darkwolf is alright apart from possibly the worst cgi effect ever its reasonably well made  it at least seems to have production values the acting is what youd expect reallybr br darkwolf is yet another low budget piece of crap horror film that litter video shop shelves  clutter the schedules of obscure cable tv stations i didnt think it was as bad as some but its like saying going to the dentist is slightly more fun than going to a funeral although when all said  done theyre both horrible still
3,the fight scenes were great loved the old and newer cylons and how they painted the ones on their side it was the ending that i hated i was disappointed that it was earth but 150k years back but to travel all that way just to start over are you kidding me 38k people that fought for their very existence and once they get to paradise they abandon technology no way sure they were eating paper and rationing food but that is over they can live like humans again they only have one good doctor what are they going to do when someone has a tooth ache never mind giving birth yea right no one would have made that choice
2,i just finished reading a book about dillinger this movie was horribly inaccurate its like they got a list of names and just made everything up his robberies and getaways were well planned down to the second  when the time was up they left whether they had all of the money or not they had notes of every road where to turn etc purvis never saw him at the restaurant he was told that dillinger paid for his meal after dillinger left purvis never even saw dillinger before the night dillinger was killed only photos of him the way his gang members died were fictitious dillinger never robbed a bank by himself like he did in this movie if i had never read the book maybe i could have enjoyed the movie the acting was a bit over the top in places the action was overdone as well on second thought i doubt if i would have enjoyed it much even if i hadnt read the book
0,one of johns funniest eugene levy is great in this one as well just wish the studio would figure out that this one needs to be on dvd i have it on video tape but feel that this film deserves dvd and extras would be great the kung fu uuniversity kung fu u skit is so very funny as is the entire film also the scenes he has with his girlfriend and her family are great this movie never seems to be on tv but it loses most of its hilarity when edited for broadcast tv if you can find the video i would suggest you buy it ebay is a good place to find a copy i will keep my vhs until one day we get to see it on dvd there are so many great movies out there that still have not been released to dvd and this is one of them
0,the only reason that i did not give this 10 stars was the dvd formatno menus extras etc however if you have ever had a dream to do something with your life this film is for you if you believe in yourself and your dream do not let anyone or anything stop you this is one of the most lifeaffirming films that i have ever seen and magical the acting is superb the plot serves the purpose and the opening sequence is fantastic this is one of those films that cult status used to be about i have recommended this film to all of my friends some love it some cant finish it whenever i think or feel  that something is impossible i think about alan arkins role in this film sure wish hed make more films
0,i watched peter jackson version of lord of the rings when i was half way through reading the two towers and i thought it was absolutely brilliantbr br at this time the animated version of the lord of the rings was released on dvd but i told myself that i will finish reading the two towers and return of kings before watching it as i thought it showed the whole of the trilogybr br so when i did finish the trilogy i went and brought the dvd which was a stupid idea because it was absolutely rubbishbr br i was acturly bored 20 minutes in to it which was really strange because i love the book and i am shooked that the maker of this film could of even thought of fitting at least and a half of the books in to a hour minute filmbr br none of the characters had any emotions when they were talking and they seemed to be reading it of a page even my favourite character who is gandalf did not seem interesting at all br br the animation was the only okay in parts of the film except for the orks they looked awful and aragorn and sam facebr br i dont know way this film was released because there was not even a proper ending but maybe it was good that the maker ran out of money because the film couldnt of got any better br br i just hope that nobody judges the books by this filmbr br 310
4,this movie was a rather odd viewing experience the movie is obviously based on a play now im sure that everything in this movie works out just fine in a play but for in a movie it just doesnt feel terribly interesting enough to watch the movie is way too stagey and they didnt even bothered to change some of the dialog to make it more fitting for a movie instead what is presented now is an almost literally refilming of a stageplay with overthetop characters and staged dialog because of all this the storyline really doesnt work out and the movie becomes an almost complete bore and obsolete viewing experiencebr br it takes a while before you figure out that this is a comedy youre watching at first you think its a drama youre watching with quirky characters in it but as the movie progresses youll notice that the movie is more a tragicomedy that leans really more toward the comedy genre rather than the drama genrebr br the characters and dialog are really the things that make this movie a quirky and overthetop one that at times really become unwatchable sure the actors are great peter otoole and susannah york amongst others but they dont really uplift the movie to a level of watchable enoughbr br the story feels totally disorientated basicaly the story is about nothing and just mainly focuses on the brothersister characters played by peter otoole and susannah york but what exactly is the story even about the movie feels like a pointless and obsolete one that has very little to offer like i said before im sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage but as a movie it really isnt fitting and simply doesnt work outbr br the editing is simply dreadful and times and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequences br br more was to expect from director j lee thompson who has obviously done far better movies than this rather failed stageplay translated to screen projectbr br really not worth your timebr br 410
1,billy chung siu hungs the bloody swordplay film assassin from 1993 film love to kill hong kong 1993 is among the strongest products of the category iii boom that inhabited the hk cinema in early nineties it consisted of films with strong sex nudity and violence more or less gratuitous and shock valued only love to kill definitely belongs to the more category with some unforgettable ideas and pieces of celluloid sicknessbr br the hk psycho anthony wong from the award winning the untold story by herman yau from the same year plays a business man and a husband who likes to torture humiliate and rape his young wife elizabeth lee mei fung who for some reason doesnt leave him and save herself and their little son from the disturbed tormentor a policeman danny lee the famous police character actor from films like dr lamb 1992 by billy tang and codirected by lee and the killer 1989 by john woo to name just a few however sees the problem and starts to protect the wife and the son but anthony naturally doesnt like this at all and leads it all into the typical ultramean spirited and graphic finale during a rain stormbr br the film is almost completely without any serious merits as its just a piece of exploitation in order to cash in when these kind of films were so popular the imagery and happenings are something never found in the western cinema at least in mainstream and it all becomes even more mindblowing when somemost taboos for westerners like violence and perversions witnessed by a child are broken in these films so often that reading the plotlines alone would make most viewers feel sick and that goes perfectly especially for this film toobr br the film still has a rather interesting and creepy soundtrack in the tradition of the mentioned dr lamb which practically started the whole boom in 1992 usually the music and soundtrack in hk films is interesting and adds to the imagery especially in these terror films also the cinematography is worth mentioning as the film bathes especially in the finale in blue colors and camera lenses as does assassin too and the raging storm is captured nicely on the camera otherwise theres nothing that would rate the film any higher other than on the nastinessmeterbr br the actors and actresses are talented and professional and so dont make the film any worse with their acting still the film has the usual hk humor in it which makes the sick goingson even sicker as some humor is thrown into the soup that includes some jokes about danny lees erection and so onsomething that could never be found in the western serious films either and that thing usually destroys mane otherwise noteworthy hk films as the humor is just so obvious way and attempt to entertain the audience and massesbr br the film has a very high outrageousness level as it has numerous scenes depicting the abuse of wongs wife in various ways she gets raped and molested beaten and kicked by her husband we also get to see some flashbacks from wongs own childhood which turns out to be equally violent as his own father killed too and turned his young son into what he is now these flashback scenes mostly at the end of the film include also some totally unexpected experiences as the imagery is speeded up for example the hits of an axe and that creates completely insane and mean spirited atmosphere to the scene again something that only hk exploitation makers seem to be able to come up with the ending itself includes plenty of sudden and shocking gore as the madman wields his axe and meets also some nails for example on his furious waybr br the film is also genuinely pretty suspicious in my opinion as the violence and terror is realistically painful and deals with things that should never be taken as entertainment mostly i mean rape the version i saw ive seen two versions includes a very long and completely nauseating rape scene that just tries to be as sadistic as possible im not sure does the hk audience really like imagery like this but i think no one with some sense for morality in filmsentertainment would never accept or make something like it women get brutalized and killed in the most sadistic and low ways so that the fates of the men seem almost tame when compared to the femalesbr br the other version i saw the newly released dvd in hk without subtitles has this table brutality scene in a much longer form than the subtitled taiwanese dvd which is otherwise identical to the hk version ive also heard that the old hk laserdisc is different from these two and since the end credits are filled with scenes and images not found in the actual film it is impossible to say how uncut versions these that have been released or shown theatrically are obviously plenty of footage has been cut out possibly even before the theatrical releasebr br the film is written by law gam fai and lau wing kin the former having written also films like dr lamb the untold story and gunmen kirk wong 1988 but out of his other films that ive seen love to kill is the most gratuitous dr lamb and the untold story both are very brutal and violent but have also some attempt to some criticism towards the authorities and men in general as how it is easy to turn into a beast when chasing or fighting one the harrowing torture imagery of the untold story the victim being the criminal is very strong and definitely has its impact to change something that may be rotten in the society and among the police for example but theres none of this in love to kill it is just honest calculated and fastly made exploitation which is by the way produced by a veteran director kirk organized crime  triad bureau 1993 crime story 1993 wongbr br love to kill earns no more than 210 from me as i dont have too high appreciation on films like this hk cinema is meant to be and can be more and films like love to kill are only commercial parasites living among the real pieces of the art
0,i tried to sit through this bomb not too long agowhat a disaster the acting was atrociousthere were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a lead balloonthis was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors just didnt ring truesupposedly a modern reworking of the hitchcock original lifeboati think hictcock would be spinning circles in his grave at the very thought of itfrom what i was able to suffer throughthere is nothing compelling in this movieit boasts a few semi big namesbut they put no effort into their charactersbutyou knowto be fairit was nobodys fault reallyi meanim pretty sure the script blew up in the first explosion lolit is possible that this thing ends up improving as it goes alongbut for meim not willing to spend at least three days to find outso unless you have at least a three day weekend on the horizonavoid this stinker 110
0,i am watching the series back to back as fast as possible i am attempting to watch all things star trek this is month and i am now on season of tng and i have already gone thru ds9 in its entirety star trek is the greatest television phenomenon ever achievedbr br shades of grey is the first recap episode in the tng series having just watched the shows these clips were fresh in my mind but i noticed how a couple of them were reshot because the film looked better season always seemed real dark and ugly to me  and the actors looked silly like they didnt fit in their own skinsbr br the show is essentially just made of up a greatest hits of the happiest and saddest moments in rikers life on the enterprise up until this point the data and riker scene in the holodeck is a classic moment of new friendship my other favorite is when the 2nd officer on the klingon ship challenges rikers authority as first officer and riker beat the living crap out of that klingon then the admiral kicks his a but good this entire episode is a heck of a reminder that a lot of crazy great things have happened already in a mere seasons with more to go and a handful of movies at this point in the series they are really starting to develop the emotions that tie riker to deanna troi as imzadi up until this point they have mentioned the fact but they have yet to exploit it let the record show that the st wiki  memory alpha claims that imzadi means first and denotes that she has had intimate relations with riker and also remains deeply close on an emotional one this episode further proves there will be a tense romantic interest in each other for a long time to comebr br here is the article httpmemoryalphaorgenwikiimzadi by this point in the series production value is up to speed and star trek tng is settling into the scifi behemoth it was destined to become watching this again as an adult i see now what great actors the star trek universe provides they really need to make a new st show set after all the current shows a ds9 movie would have been nice too
7,well first off id like to add that i myself is somewhat of a historian so what i look for in a film that is based upon historical events is that it is actually based upon historical facts but this is however not the case here sure the movie is entertaining and all but the fact that it isnt entirely based upon true facts is more than annoying hitler wasnt antisemitic in his youth he even worked for jews before world war one it was however during world war one and after that he formed his views about the jews his upbringing in this movie is also inaccurate hitler as a child wasnt a disturbed little brat he had a more or less normal upbringing nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important pieces that adds to the puzzle that is hitlerbr br robert carlyle is a great actor but he doesnt really fit in the role as hitler hitler wasnt as impossible and unstable as he is portraited here under his younger years he was a charismatic person whom manipulated people through his charms his unstable behavior and rage outbursts started in the turning point of the warbr br id like to see a film about hitlers life that is based upon real historical facts and not accusations i really hate when people point a blaming finger at for example hitler and others and tell inaccurate stories just to paint a picture of them as pure evil it is much better to actually tell the story exactly as it was so that everyone can learn what it was like the ones behind this movie should have made some research before making this because it seems as if they didnt even know what really happened hitler wasnt even shot in the revolutionary march in munch his shoulder was ripped out of its socketbr br it gives you more to see a good documentary than seeing this
4,i thought hedy burress who managed to escape from the watery grave of part one was going to be in part guess not i just think they should of killed her off like in friday the 13th part you know what i meanbr br this movie like scream and urban legend followed movies within a moviebr br this was pure crap the whole movie within a movie crapbr br bad stay away
5,this movie was great and i would like to buy itthe boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young eagle the boy has to feed and care for the eagle until it is old enough to be sacrificed for the crops the boy saves the eagle from being killed and runs away from the tribethe eagle helps feed him by catching a duck from a small pond the boy scares up later the boy shoots a deer that a bully kid was claiming because their arrows were marked very close the same only until they check the thickness of the red lines do they determine who actually got the deer but this was unfortunate because it made the other boys even crueler to himand at the end he is being chased up onto a cliff but when you think he will fall off his pure love for the eagle transforms him into a golden eagle with only a necklace as a reminder of who he wasplease if anyone knows where i can buy this movie let me knowi havent seen it for over 30 yearsbut still remember parts of the moviedeniselacey2000yahoocom
5,one of the comedies of the 1970s also has the best signature tune of any comedy show the story is about three people sharing a flat living above their landlords george and mildred the comedy rests on the mix of the people sharing a man and two women richard o sullivan is besotted with paula wilcox its played in a gentle and not a leering way which is why this show was such a successbr br the scripts and the stars were always giving the best performances and richards frustrated love life was shown with a relaxed charm the end titles contained visual jokes which went unnoticed in the early 1970s but concerned the flat sharers living arrangements
4,tommy jones and matt dillon do the gambling world proud the various moves with the wrists had to be learned as throwing craps is a skill in and of itselfbr br there are a few surprises as cynical as we are today i fully expected the good girl to be crying over his grave instead of his buddys especially with her remarks about going to the funeral of her best friend when she first meets matt and then of course you expect matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid in mr allens face blinding him interesting role by bruce dern wrrrooonnnnggg some of the other hollywood endings do happen but the writing is so excellent the acting so carefully wrought that youre blissfully unawarebr br and the music is out of this world taking us back to the 50s when our native passions were first being unleashed by the music of ray charles and bo diddley even a little racism raring its ugly head in chicago but at a club called wonderfully biloxi with a confederate flag backing up the racist remarks ill be watching it again just to hear the music good thing i have the factotum sound track so i can listen to that in the car watch both together and youll see how matt has maturedplaying bar room characters in both now that he owns a bar in the paramount hotel in nyc he probably has great opportunity to do his studies great actor just coming into his own he shows finely nuanced performances the good and the bad in his characters his young boy off the farm is a great study made especially poignant because of his bassetthound eyes he makes love convincingly as well since he was in several movies with diane lane as a teenager i wonder how that it making love to an actress you kinda grew up with adds conviction ill say that
0,i have looked forward to seeing this since i first saw it listed in her work finally found it yesterday 21302 on lifetime movie channelbr br jim larsons comments about it being a sweet funny story of people crossing paths were dead on writers probably shouldnt get a bonus everyone else sro for making the moviebr br anybody who appreciates a romantic movie should see itbr br natashas screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric to say nothing of her beauty that anything she is in goes on my favorite list her tv and print interviews that i have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking forbr br god bless her her family and future endeavorsbr br this movie doesnt seem to available in dvd or video yet but i would be the first to buy it and i think others would too
3,same old same old about che it completely ignored the really interesting facts of ches true character sodeberg redid the same boring narrative of che the silly seductive tale of an argentinean richboy who was so shocked by poverty he became a robin hood fighting alongside the poor until eventually he was murdered by the cia yeah yeah heard it all before boring and untrue the reality of che guevara is very different and far more explosive the facts show that he was a totalitarian with a messiah streak who openly wanted to impose maoist tyranny on the world he was so fanatical that at the hottest moment in the cold war he even begged the soviet union to nuke new york washington or los angeles and bring about the end of the world che urged khrushchev to launch a nuclear strike against us cities for the rest of his life he declared that if his finger had been on the button he would have pushed it when khrushchev backed down and literally saved the world che was furious at the betrayal if ches recommendations had been followed you would not be reading this review now how a homicidal maniac became a pop icon would have made a much more interesting film incredible that no filmmaker has been daring enough to show the real side of che and his posthumous media transformation that would make an oscar winning film i thought making independent film meant taking real risks and being groundbraking they only stick to safe counterculture themes to wit che cool wall street bad republican nazi bush ex hitler nra is worse than kgb christians are fanatics and stupid etcad nauseum oooh how daring how mind blowing tres antimainstream and edgy i wish they would have some real cojones and tackle the independent film oligarchy that would be truly daring
7,its hard to watch this movie without thinking forward to the television show it would become especially if like me you happen to like the tv show more but theres a lot to be said for the sourcebr br oscar madison walter matthau is a top new york city sportswriter who lives in an eightroom apartment by himself a casualty of divorce and his own stubbornly sloppy mindset enter his friend felix ungar jack lemmon needing a place to live after his wife threw him out for his stubbornly neatnik mindset the result is a train wreck and one of the most beloved movie adaptations of a neil simon stage playbr br first things first i love that apartment poker table novelty dart board askew photos of baseball players empty booze and beer containers even a pair of roman columns its a place where men can be boys simon and director gene saks do a great job opening up the stage plays single set oscars living room by moving the action into the bedrooms and kitchen and giving the mounting tension between oscar and felix more corners to bounce off ofbr br neal heftis familiar score was heard on the tv show but never so sweepingly orchestrated as it is here in several different arrangements that make the onscreen action soar whenever its played real location work and night shots of manhattan give the film an energy common to films shot in that place and time buddwing the world of henry orient midnight cowboy manchurian candidate rosemarys baby etcbr br are lemmon and matthau too heavy in comparison to tony randall and jack klugman to be fair the movie is meant to be a more serious affair dealing with the thenuncommon condition of midlife divorce and the frustration inherent in not being able to make a relationship work simon has more in mind than entering felix and oscar in a game of password or a battle of wits with howard cosell but i dont knowbr br both lemmon and matthau were terrific comedians i enjoy watching especially in the middle of this film as i often do in their separate movies but i never understood why they were regarded as a great comedy team here in their bestregarded partnership they seem to be acting in two different films lemmon in a comedydrama and matthau in a farce matthau is great in the beginning charming us with his teddybear demeanor around the poker table but near the end of the film he takes a turn much like jack torrances in the shining reacting to felix cleaning up his apartment and serving tasty food to his friends in a way that totally upsets the delicate balance of blamebr br while the ending bothers me the part many see as the most jarring the beginning works fine as i see it watching felix stumbling around trying to kill himself isnt great comedy no but its a good way to get into a great comedy setting us up with some reallife pain before bringing in the warmth and laughter plus it has some great shots of the seedier parts of the city in the middle of the movie this scene would have been a miscalculation but it works as a way of establishing felixs torment and a sense of sharp relief to come when we see oscar and his poker friends bicker and feudbr br thats where simons lines are so great they are the underlying strength of the film he gets the banter exactly right and real and still makes it funny i dont mind you talking felix you got things to say whats scaring me is im beginning to listen the tv show showed how wrong it is to assume the movie is always better in fact the tv show once made a good point about assuming anything at all but the movie makes for a solid foundation and is a joy in its own right
1,why do they insist on making remakes of great movies like high noon from here to eternity and this onebr br why do they think that color is more engrossing to a viewer than stark black and whitebr br why did roberts insist on wearing that dopey broadbilled baseball capit made him look like jim varneybr br why would anyone spend four hours suffering through thisbr br watch the original then you wont have to ask yourself why
7,my friends mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out so when she brought home the convent a horror movie i couldnt wait to watch it given that its supposed to be scary but is actually downright hilarious i can say that in some weird way i like this movie br br yes the acting is bad and yes its the cheapest movie ive ever seen but its so damn funny what are you smoking carack i didnt know this movie even was ever released i figured it was too bad br br yeah so overall the movie is pretty bad you gotta admit that much at least but i promise you you will get a good laugh out of itbr br this movie kinda sucks but its good for a laugh especially that guy that holds the dagger of despair the dagger of despaaaaaair
7,this has to be hands down hats off one of the most uproarious comedies ever made starting with the animated blowing popping bubbles the entrance to the daytime awards the usual phony drivel spewed by the stars on the red carpet the rehearsed and badly acted acceptance speech the venomous comments uttered by the actors jealous costars and producer under phony smiles now that is only in the first few minutes then all hell breaks loose from there and it only gets more frantic and ridiculous ridiculous in a good way no make that a great way this was the first time id seen the always charming teri hatcher while i may not be a follower of desperate housewives she herself is always watchable  same goes for lois  clark not a huge follower but if i run across an episode id watch it robert downey jr does a great turn as slimy smarmy snaky sycophantic david seaton barnes the producer whod give his right eye to see sally fields celeste talbert leave the show if only to finally get to get it on with cathy moriartys montana mooreheadbr br moriarty absolutely shines in this movie just as she had everywhere else shes appeared here all she has to do is scream i hate you i hate you you creep or give one of her anticelestecoconspirators an evil grin and she has me rolling in the aisles yes cathy moriarty is a very gifted actress and one hell of a comedienne sally field gratefully departs from the usual 70mmsized lifetime tragedy of the week movies and were all reminded why she is who she is today having started off in comedy afraid of nothing her ensuing years of drama had hidden her sense of humor but like a caterpillar in a cocoon the brilliant comedienne she is had blossomed and it was joyous to see her as hilarious as she was the thing with dramatic actors and actresses is that you see in such heavy serious roles that you associate them with their character and you cant believe it when you see them finally having some fun on screenbr br how lucky were the producers to land carrie fisher if only for a glorified cameo she doesnt realize what a presence she bears on screen she takes a role which in the hands of a lesser actress could easily have been forgotten but she owns the character and it seems as if she wrote it herselfbr br how lucky was elisabeth shue to get thrown in the middle of all this at the time she wasnt really known for much adventures in babysitting was kind of cute yes i was dragged to an evening show for which i had to pay full price but she didnt hold my attention   much but here she makes the most of her character  stars niece who falls in love with the stars excostarandlover who of course turns out to be the nieces father and the star turns out to be the poor girls motherbr br ill stop there  i feel i practically wrote a book about this brilliant screwball comedy or at least a novela if youve seen it then reminisce if you havent youve missed a real classic but not really the dvds are made of a material thatll last for at least 25 years and this movie is timeless so what the hell
1,six different couples six different love stories six different love angles eighty numbers of audience in the movie theater looking at the eighty different parts of the silver screenbr br i am sitting in somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to find out whats going on in the movie all stories have got no link with each other but somewhere down the line nikhil advani trying to show some relation between them i tried to find out a few lines i could write as review but at the end of hours 15 minutes found nothing to write the movie is a poor copy of hollywood blockbuster love actuallybr br my suggestion dont watch the movie if you really want to watch a nice movie
6,okay at first this movie seemed pretty good even though it was moving rather quick and even though they only had a 60000 budget it was good but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who might have killed her why would you go chase him around and pull a gun on him with only one bullet and waste it and end up running from him all retarded and get yourself killed plus after you found your sister dead in the lake and found a clue and figured out who the killer was why wouldnt you hand that clue over to the police who think you killed her and at the end of the movie when she acts like her sister who was a waitress and she is talking to the bad guy she should of met him somewhere and recorded him saying she was dead and what happened for her proof i dont know i was not happy with the ending this movie could of been so much better if it lasted longer and the acting was better and if the ending did not suck so bad do not waste your money on this movie because if you do you will be writing a review on here too and will not be happy
1,i started watching the apprentice about years agomaybe and i really really liked it the first thing that strikes you about it is the refreshing format which though similar to a lot of other reality shows at its core is still very entertaining donald trump is wonderful as the host and the main judge of the show as well the casting coup with intelligent people having good looks being picked as contestants is appreciated as well but the best part of the show is new york city mark burnett may have made a lot of crap in his time but his handling of the cinematography is excellent as he makes nyc look like a character unto itself the jazz tunes coupled with some great camerawork make new york look spectacularbr br the apprentice will easily alway make my top reality shows of all timethe amazing race is no 1howeverbut just like the amazing race this show is always best watched in moderation if you keep watching it for a while the originality of the show will wear off fastthe same case as with tarstar world the broadcasters in this country did a bang up job in presenting the show the first three seasons were shown in a row then after years the next two seasons were shown which kept the concept freshbr br in conclusion you will love this show especially the first seasons however if you keep watching the show continuously thereafter its charm will wear off and fast
0,this begins a wager between edgar allen poe and a journalistpoe bets that the man can not spend an entire night in a creepy castle well of course he can but will he come out unscathed hard to say with all these strange people that arent supposed to be there wandering around including the icy barbara steele this is a fairly odd film in that the presentation is both in french and english and switches back and forth a few times perhaps this is done because bits of dialog were lost its also rather dark and claustrophobic being that one doesnt see much beyond a small circle of light that candles and such generate plus theres a feel of dread and impending doom pretty much at all times this version on synapse is also uncensored and i wondered what might be censored in a film from 1964 until i saw the topless scene i guess that might be it overall this is pretty good and in gloomy black and white barbara steele definitely makes the movie too out of 10
0,what a surprising treat to come across on late television had i only read a brief plot rundown on a television listing before seeing the movie i would have passed the idea of a movie about a hitmanseeinga shrinkwantingto leavethebusinessandfallinginlovesounds trite but the film works from the start of the movie its clear the man carries a weight on his shoulders before he even says a word the look and feel of the film is perfect dark but not obnoxiously sobr br aside from the hitman family aspect which provides a touch of surrealism macys character grapples with his marriage and his fathers control macy shows a repressed sadness and his bedtime talks with his young son are amazing the young boy shows acting skills well beyond his years and the interaction between the father and son is so very natural personal and lovingbr br this is one of the best movies ive seen in a while and i cant believe i came across it by accident on late night television
4,the comment by eliz72121 hits the proverbial nail on the head for this turkey of a program but it is a hoot to watch william shatner cavort and dance yes the   marks on the word dance are necessary for what bill does this show would be a great skit on snl or mad tv  and it does rate a few stars for one viewing or so to see shatner who seems to have taken camp to new heights  whether in a role or as himself but the guy is funnybr br the girls who are in the cubicle areas with the game data scrolls will be pretty much outofluck when this turkey is canceled  unless there is a revival of the whiskeyagogo genre with a resurrected demand for shapely young women to dance in elevated cages once morebr br i watched the first contestant who was annoying and literally dumber than a post yet through sheer luck walked away with a quarter mil or so the second contestant somewhat more intelligent but whod be lucky to gain 1000 on jeopardy got zonked by the card which requires answering a special question  which he didnt know and thereby left with zilchbr br this plethora of game shows which dangle and sometimes award large sums to everyday individuals are admittedly a cheap effort overall to attempt to woo viewers even if the host is wellcompensated and they give away six figures in an average episode i suppose that the revenue versus costs can be favorable  since you dont have a sitcom cast where several stars are getting six or seven figures per episode with some big residual deals as wellbr br but i suspect even the better ones will wear thin before long this one has already pretty much reached this point i think his offerings especially with james spader and the others on boston legal should give us a satisfying quantity of bill shatners offeringsbr br again the above rating is simply appropriate to view bill hoot and prance perhaps one time that should be sufficient
7,but sadly due to rights issues that almost certainly will never happen transcripts of joe bobs commentary on the sub b movies he screened are available on the internet but they dont quite capture his twang inflected delivery which was a real hoot nowadays joe bob real name john bloom is confined to doing the supplemental features of such classics as i spit on your grave featuring what some exploitation fans call the greatest gang rape on film of all time and jason x one of the most reviled friday the 13th sequels of all time the series was never the same once it left paramount all i could think when they canceled it was damn where else am i going to get my fill of flesh ripping blonde jokes and horror trivia every saturday night does this mean i have to get a life now sadly it does but therell always be a place in my horror hungry heart for monstervision long live the drivein
2,i grew up watching the original disney cinderella and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little wornbr br accordingly i was excited to see that cinderella was coming on tv and i would be able to see itbr br i should have known betterbr br this movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have just been left alone it holds absolutely none of the originals super charm it seems to me quite rough and almost brutal right from the dontsingalongs to the characterizationbr br while i remember the characters telling a story through a song this films soundtrack was laid over the top and didnt seem to fit jaqs transformation into a human is a prime example where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall and in the ballroom theres old barn dance type country music its as though the writers forgot where and when this story was set the upbeat fiddles certainly didnt fitbr br even the artwork and animation in cinderella isnt up to scratch with the original the artwork in this film seems quite raw and less detailed and we see part of cinderellas hoop skirt which doesnt feel rightbr br the movie itself could have been its own story i think that it should have been just that i wouldnt say that i hate it but i believe that it had many shortcomings it seems to downgrade in a significant way from the beloved cinderella original
7,and the oscar for the most underrated classic horror actor goes to  dwight frye seriously his name should be stated with the same awe as karloff lugosi and price and this movie proves it his character herman was one of the reasons i can give to watch this movie dwight gave this somewhat more than slightly disturbed misfit a lovable yet creepy demeanor that led you hoping for a larger role the entire moviebr br the other reason is the comic relief of m eburne being in the medical profession myself i have to give kudos to the expert performance of a selfpity prone hypochondriac though other medical mistakes did give a brief chuckle especially when the good doctor samples his fellow physicians medication well continue giving it to her unfortunately these outstanding performances could not keep me awake through attempts of sitting through this unbearably slow movie the plot is predictable with only few minor twists the filming while pulling off a legitimate spooky atmosphere was more productive at making me yawn  yes you can use too much shadowbr br my recommendation  watch this once to see frye and eburne  but only when wide awake and with lots of caffeine
7,the title song for this movie is the greatest free spirited ballad ever written         br br i first saw this movie back in 197879 when i first subscribed to cable in 1979 cable was just starting to become common place in homes or at least that when it was becoming common here in missouribr br this might very well be the first movie i ever watched on the pay channel called the movie channel  which was called the star channel back then they changed the name to the movie channel in the early 1980si received a free month of the star channel with my new cable subscription the van was one of the movies that was in heavy rotation on that network at that timebr br i remember watching this movie back then and thinking it was a typical teen flickalong the same lines as other medium budget teen flicks the ones where the plot revolves around nudity and partiesbr br i totally forgot that this movie even existed until i recently seen this movie again after having not seeing it for decades i found a copy of it on dvd for sale in cheap bin i recognized it and bought it for a mere 499br br seems like i had remembered this film being much better that it wasis however watching it back then was a different experience than watching now30 years laterbr br it was fun to see the kids listing to rock n roll music smoking weed and having sex in the back a fancy vanoften all at the same time this is what a good teen party movie should bebr br there isnt much of a plot other than the fact that the main character fantasizes about having sex with his arch rivals good looking girlfriend he blows all of his college savings money to purchase a tricked out dodge vanwith shag carpet walls  mirrored ceiling and a water bed in itto get her attention and he eventually gets to have sex with her but his arch rival finds out and comes looking for him so that the two of them can settle their differences by drag racing their vanshe and his arch rival end up wrecking both of their vans and instead of stealing away his arch rivals girlfriend he wins over the heart of a preppylesser attractive girl that he halfass dates through most of the movie and he decides he is happierbetter off and the movie endsbr br the movie does have its funny moments but watching this movie 30 years later it becomes more of a trip down memory lane because i still can remember pizza parlors pinball arcades it also brought back memories of cruising around a small town while we smoked pot as we would yell at good looking girls and hoping to get laid sometimes id get lucky and get some decent looking girl to share a joint with me and wed screw in the backseat afterwords i also remember many of the songs in this movewhen they were newthis movie serves as a perfect time capsule for that era in those regards brought back lots of memoriesbr br the one thing that is depicted in this movie that i honestly can not remember is i never remember a time when full sized vans were as popular as this film depicts them as being i remember that era very well and i dont young men going around wishing they had a van instead i remember young men in the 70s self included wanting a pontiac trans am chevy camaro or a hot rod ford mustang but never a van this movie makes it appear as if vans were most popular item going and that every young man wanted onewhich just wasnt true of that era
3,i saw this film when it was originally released in 1989 i enjoyed it then and i still do now but what i realize now is that this is quite adult for a film with a g rating especially the notion of dying and going to heaven burt reynolds and dom deluise work wonderfully together and reynolds singing voice is appropriate for a junkyard dog there are some good songs ranging from upbeat lets make music together to downright emotional home to my heart i found the plot good although it does go off on a tangent once or twice the final scene of the film with charlie and annemarie is one of the saddest ive ever seen in animation a film worth experiencing
1,poor paul mercurio after landing the role of scott hastings in strictly ballroom the best film in history he managed to find himself doing a lot of rubbish none of the characters in this film is very unlikable or even hateable but mercurios lead is the sort of person you prefer to ignore  completely unloveable and he wears overalls big mistake in costume design that one
3,imagine that you are asked by your date what movie you wanted to see and you remember seeing a rather intriguing trailer about the grudge so in good faith you recommend seeing that movie it is the halloween season after all and it did boffo box office this past weekend so it must be pretty goodso you gobr br and youre actually in a state of shock when the movie ends the way it does and you hear yourself audibly saying that cant be the end of the movie but alas it is br br and imagine coming out of the movie theater being embarrassed and ashamed for recommending such a dog of a movie you think that your date thinks youre a bonehead for suggesting such an atrocity and your suggestion will certainly end a promising relationship actually it was so bad that both of us cracked up laughing at how bad it was i see no future for miss gellar in the movies and suggest that she sticks to television in the future actually it wont be long before she is consigned to fleamarket conventions selling buffy memorabilia and it cant happen soon enough if you ask me horrible horrible horrible the plot didnt make sense continuity was terrible its apparent that the whole ending was contrived to have a grudge iithe return of catboy
7,i couldnt believe this terrible movie was actually made at all with the worst actors you could find the worst script written mark frost  sollace mitchell and by far the worst waste of time in viewing i wont belabor the story as its really not worth it but i will elaborate on some of the performances and definitely the story as to the story it is very hard to believe that this bitty crazy schemer could actually do what she did that in reality the wife couldnt defend herself against a little bitty of a thing that the husband could actually find the nut case attractive at all that the defense attorney could break every court rule there was and keep on doing it after the judge ordered the blankety blank to shut up and the final result of the film is an insult to justice movie codes and the male species the theme of this mess is let women do as they wish kill whom they want defend the killer and get away with it while the guy rots in jail the innocent victim hard to believe that sollace mitchell the director and a man would even want to make this dribblebr br as to the acting jordan ladd the killer is awful a loony toons who does needlepoint during her murder trial is this allowed in court she bored me to the hilt one more look of her batting her eyes and indicating how innocent she was and id throw up shes not even attractive enough for any guy to leave his wife the husband played on one level by vincent spano just seems to look and act stupid most of the time he was so predictable in his performance falling into the traps set for him by all the women surrounding him the worst by far was holland taylor as the defense attourney she over acted throughout the film and made a mockery of justice if she would cross examine me anytime id have told her to go take a hike everybody else in this sleazy film did their job as directed to do sobr br i wish i could give this film a zero rating however we are forced to start with too bad lets not have anymore painful watching films like this lifetime can do better then this i know itbr br this is a postscript made the mistake of turning this insipid movie on by mistake as soon as i saw the bimbo jordan ladd i knew id seen it before and didnt like it or her i not only turned the darn thing off but had to add my anger at people like sollace mitchell who wrote the screenplay but also directed this horrible flick doesent anyone see that herhis message is that sickness pays being ill and going around killing people is okay with this directorwriter totally making the male species idiots well this male tells you to go stuff it somewhere painful were not all that stupid and will speak out to your so called movie which in this persons mind deserves to be trashedbr br and again this loser is shown why cant you read the comments on this stupid and despicable movie are we constantly subjected to see the bimbo jordan ladd again and again get her off tv films and out of sight shes just terrible in every sense of the word phew
3,it was the worst ending i have ever seen if some one can please tell me how and why the last chick goes crazy and eats the old women in the end why dose the movie have all those cheap crappy scares in it in the beginning but yet when the first person dies they kill them all off in minutes most of the people could act but i do give so credit to the porn stars they did their best also it had a couple funny parts and kills like when the care taker gets his organs riped out of his ass and then gets choked with it if this movie had an ending that could make any since i would have given it a out of 10 but the ending made no since the ending sucked but the rest was great
4,dan katzir has produced a wonderful film that takes us on a rollercoaster ride through a real romance set in the troubles surrounding modern israelbr br for anyone whos ever been in love the film brings back the uncertainties the insecurities and heartache that make love so bittersweet the atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in israel at that time just serve to intensify the feeling instantly you are drawn in to dans plight and you cant fail to be deeply movedbr br you cant write drama and passion like this  the contrast between the realities of dans desperate snatched relationship with iris and the realities of a state in turmoil make this eminently watchable if you have an ounce of passion and have ever been in love see this film
4,i first saw this movie on television some years ago and frankly loved it charles dance makes one of the most terrifying villains anyone can imagine his sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the crudely good hero i have never been much of an eddie murphy fan but find his irritating portrayal here a winner a bit of axel foley through the looking glass charlotte lewis is to utilize a hackneyed phrase but the only one applicable luminously gorgeous some scenes are wonderfully created the dream sequence the bird the silly fight scenes and the climactic confrontation through it all murphy is the modern man suddenly dropped into an oriental myth a stunned and quieter version of kurt russell in his oriental fantasy romp like that movie we have james hong the incomparable actor whose scenes however short raise the quality even of derek since 1955 hong has defined the fine supporting actor the class act of his profession the golden child is silly it is not perfect but it has so many redeeming features that it is an enjoyable and amusing fantasy well worth watching after four years i have seen the golden child again i enjoyed it even more it truly is great fun
5,pet sematary succeeds on two major situations first its a scary horror movie those that just arent produced in these days second its an emotional clever movie overall so if you are looking for chills scares creepiness and visually stunning settings great acting dialongs and gruesome effects this is the movie you are looking for a classic now and truly a must see for any horror fan br br probably the best adaptation to any of kings novels the events feel a little rushed compared with the novel but that doesnt means that this underrated movie isnt a complete horrordrama accomplishment br br stephen kings novel is widely known for being very emotional and gruesome at the same time the movie captures the same feeling mainly because theres a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between its members then when everything seems to be happiness technically happy because the title pet sematary does not offers appiness a tragic event changes the movies atmosphere now it turns very dark the movie has a sinister feeling since the opening credits but after gage is killed the movie becomes sad gray creepy dealing with the loss of a baby son is something that can ruin a familys entire life and pet sematary proves it dramatically br br the legend behind the pet sematary is more than a myth that no one wants to experience but sadness and desperation lead an emotionally destroyed father to give it a shot sadly enough the legend comes true and baby gage returns from the dead the previous encounter with the pet sematary legend turned out to be a tragedy but this time its something much much worse what will happened with the lives of our all american family could pascow prevent this tragedy what is it with the surreal nightmares br br watch pet sematary to witness one of the most touching emotional horror movies of recent times you wont regret the acting is very good although i didnt dig the actor who portrayed the father he didnt seem disturbed enough when the situations asked for his desperation but thats just my opinion denise crosby truly delivered a great performance and worked perfect as the noble tender mother baby gage was amazing even on his creepy parts shivers overall this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches peoples deepest fears the loss of someone you love the dead returning to life and a feeling of desperationbr br something is for sure i dont wanna be buried in a pet sematary
1,even though the shining is over a quarter of a century old i challenge anyone to not get freaked out by jack nicholsons descent into madness this is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off instead it has been referenced time and again in pop culture the twins the elevator of blood redrum the crazy nonsense writing this should be seen if for nothing else to understand all the allusions to it in daily life the film is simultaneously scary suspenseful beautiful and psychologically intriguing it has the classic mystery of hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller and it has what horror movies usually lack a great script
6,im not a huge freddy krueger fanbut that doesnt mean that i dont like robert englund and his other nightmare on elm street moviesi think that robert is a very good actornobody plays a better freddy krueger than he doesbutno offense robert this movie suckedthe acting is terriblethe plot is really weakand freddy krueger is the only part of the cast thats even worth watchingsometimes sequels can be better than the firstsuch as the friday the 13th franchisei thought the remake was the best in the seriesbut this isnt one of those moviesthe original was goodthe 2nd in my opinion was betterthe 3rd was okay but i havent seen the otherswhatever you dodont make the same mistake i did by watching this piece of crap
6,when i first saw the romeo division last spring my first reaction was brilliant however on future viewings i was provided with much more than masterful filmmaking this picture has a singular voice that will echo throughout the annuls of film historybr br the opening montage provides a splendid palette which helmer jp sarro uses to establish his art on this canvas of entertainmentbr br sarro truly uses the camera as his paintbrush while he brings us along on a ride that envelops the audience in a tremendous action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we have become accustomed to and dives deeply into dark themes of betrayal revenge and the importance of companionship this movie is any directors dream at its very corebr br however sarro was not alone in this epic undertaking the writing provided by scribe tim sheridan was just as breathtakingbr br the dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such presence and charisma on the screen specifically speaking the final scene warning spoilers spoilers where vanessa reveals herself to be one of the coalition and a villain all the time is written in such a dark tone that it is one of the most chilling endings i have ever seen sheridan is the next robert townebr br in a final note it is obvious that this production was no small featbr br therefore much praise must be given to producer scott shipley who seems to have the creativity and genius to walk next to jerry bruckheimer never before have i witnessed a production so grand with so much attention directed at every little detail a producers job is one of the hardest in any movie and shipley makes it look easybr br all in all this film combines creative writing stunning production and masterful direction this is the art of film at its best when the ending of the film arrives the only thing that is desired is morebr br the romeo division is groundbreaking a masterpiece and most importantly the romeo division is indeed art
0,still crazy has been compared to the spinal tap since both are comedies about washup rr groups actually here the similarity ends because still crazy is much better written and acted out whereas spinal tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first 10 min into a drivel that makes beavis and butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison still crazy is formulaic but the likability of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie people who expect spinal taplike attempt on satire would be disappointed by the lighthearted nature of the movie but id take a successful selfironic romp of still crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is spinal tap
1,when watching this show you are not quite sure whether it is the story or the acting that is more annoying first of all the storyline of each episode is very predictable the writers must have used every clich possible you can guess not only the general plot but the arrangement of the scenes and also the lines of each character making the show some sort of a collage of every police series out there on the top of it all comes the message of the show that the good are good and the bad are bad and that at the end of the day the good shall prevail and that we should all love each other be better man and better citizens all done in the most ostensible manner the actors as the vehicles of this message and nothing more than that will use a limited set of acting skills the i am a good carrying person smile the concerned look and the victory is ours body posture while the bad guys have the im a bad one frowning and the you caught me look followed by the im good for nothing and i should be removed from society head banding this kind of also sums up the general development of each show true story or not the show is garbage yet another proof that producers dont give a st about viewers that we are all thought to be idiots well this series makes every possible attempt to idiotize the living brains out of you
4,i saw this at the mill valley film festival hard to believe this is ms bloms directorial debut it is beautifully paced and performed large cast of characters could be out of an anne tyler novel ie they are layered with back story and potential futures there are no false notes surprising bursts of humor amidst selfinflicted anxiety and very real if not earthshattering dilemmas if you saw the best of youth you will recognize how well drawn the characters are through small moments even as the story moves briskly along i really hope this gets distribution in the usa i live in a fairly sophisticated film market yet we rarely get swedish films of any kind
0,savaged when it came out this film now looks handsome and sounds great a feast of intelligent thoughtful acting from gielgud kenneth haigh harry andrews and especially anton walbrookand a moving central performance from the beautiful and incredibly young jean seberg preminger doesnt jump around and show off his long slow takes encourage you to listen and reflect and graham greenes script condenses shaw without sacrificing complexitythe piece has the look of a made for tv movie and is certainly studio bound but none the worse for that too many contemporary movies on historical themes cannot resist dumbing down what would mel gibson have made of the maid many drooling shots of her on the rack probably then crisping up on the bbq as the flames take hold preminger does none of this the burning is shown mainly through a guiltstricken reaction there are a few weak performances but not enough to cause any serious damage i caught this movie on tv and was not expecting to watch it through but i was gripped  in our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice joans story has unexpected resonance
0,br br artisticly shot actors portray exactly their role you get a real feeling watching lucienne ascend from poverty to the most beautiful girl around a sense of tragedy to triumph to tragedy again all in all i have seen this film at least 10 times and can very well say that prix de beute the beauty prize miss europe is a major favorite in my silent film collection the expressiveness of louise brooks is perfect and i recommend this film to anyone who appreciates artistic beauty coupled with a tragic story line
6,this movie has beautiful scenery unfortunately it has no plot in order to have a plot there must be a conflict this movie had none it spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and failed to ever place any activity in it the picture tries to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story tellingbr br if you love montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just dont expect a story there isnt one
1,dark angel is a futuristic scifi series set in postapocalyptic seattle centering on max jessica alba a genetically enhanced young woman on the run from her creatorsbr br the dark angel universe is absorbing not as much as say buffy but absorbing nonetheless with an interesting and believable set of characters certainly it is not for everyone but those who give it time will find themselves watching one of the most enjoyable series out there dark angel is criminally overlooked and underrated and was unfortunatly canceled after only series which was a great shame as this had the potential to become a great series although its 42 episodes are only 10 shy of long running bbc scifi comedy red dwarf as it is dark angel remains unfinished so seek it out and if you want more lobby fox to make another series
6,this story had a different angle that intrigued me enough to buy a previouslyviewed vhs sightunseen that was a mistakebr br in what could have been a very nice story  about badly crippled people at a hospital and their various personalities  turned quickly into a very profane soap opera with unlikeable charactersbr br we have bloss william forsythe the stereotype racist white person who says the fword every other sentence and is so despicable they didnt give him a first name in the movie hes a lot of fun to be around then there is raymond hill wesley snipes a fasttalking womanizer snipes must have liked those fasttalking hip arrogant roles because he played in a number of them like in white men cant jump then there is sweet helen hunt playing anna that wonderful caring loving person who is having an adulterous affair with the leading character in the film joel garcia eric stoltzbr br yup this is heartwarming feelgood type stuff it just makes my heart melt watching these nice folks but if you are one of those who loves sleazy characters portrayed by sleazy people in this sleazy filmyou might really like this add in a dose of hollywood political correctness and there you go what more could anyone want
7,jane austens emma is an extremely enjoyable story at the worst of times and this production of the story is the best i have ever seen kake beckinsales emma is irreproachable gwyneth paltrow with the help of a good screenplay and excellent cinematography is able to bring out the comedy effectively she fails to make emma likeable paltrow is not aided by the fact that her hairstyles are simply wrong for the part and i believe the era and she looks positively ill in the empire line dresses kate beckinsale on the other hand manages the comedy effortlessly and is still able to show what mr knightly the most romantic of jane austens heroes actually sees in her mark strong is a splendid mr knightly with the right mix of handsome looks an appropriate age chivalry compassion and gentlemanly behaviour emma and mr knightly are supported by a cast of good actors and the production as a whole is quite delightful
1,life pod is one of those movies that you just watch and try not to analyze too hard the acting is rather amateurish at best the special effects are obviously low budget but not too bad the story line is rather stock but with an interesting twist computer run amok but not exactly a computer and the running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed still the movie has its moments and is quite watchable for me at least part of the allure of this movie is the prominent role of kristine debell she may not be the greatest actress in the world but having been a former playmate of the month she is cute enough in all life pod is much like other lowbudget scifi movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictablebr br the white star lines bit is cute if completely inaccurate the last of the white star lines company stock was purchased by the cunard lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the white star colors was the britannic not the sister of titanic which was sold for scrap in 1960
3,mere thoughts of going overboard aka babes ahoy make me want to weep throwing yourself out a window would be better than watching this movie its not even a supposed so bad its good movie i would spend money to buy copies of this movie and burn them so that people cant see it oh the pain the pain
5,on a distant planet a psychopath is saved from execution by a space monk he releases a few fellow inmates and breaks out of the prison in a spaceship they dock onto a ludicrously enormous spacecraft that is orbiting a supernova star this massive craft is populated by only three people presumably because the budget of the film did not extend to hiring many actors anyway to cut a long story short the three goodies end up in a game of cat and mouse with the baddiesbr br the psychopath in this movie is curious in that he is annoying annoying is generally not a term one would use to describe a lunatic  unhinged frightening dangerous maybe but not annoying but he is the three people manning the giant ship are seriously unconvincing as warranting such important roles  this ship is practically the size of a city considering that the film is set approximately 50 years in the future it is somewhat optimistic that such a huge manmade craft could exist never mind the fact that it is used for such a relatively mundane task despite the vast size of the spaceship the crew all have appallingly kitted out tiny rooms and the dining room consists of what appears to be a plastic table and chairs but there are a lot of corridorsbr br the film is fairly well acted and it works as an averagey scifi thriller but nothing great
0,i watched to movie today and it just blew my mind away it is a real masterpiece of art and i dont understand why most of the people think its garbage the main idea of the movie  take your ego away and then you will have true power this was the main battle at the end of the movie and guy ritchie has shown that in a magnificent way the greatest enemy will hide in the last place you will ever look  do you remember this from the movie because our true enemy is in us  it is our ego that voice that always tells us that we are important that gives us our pride that tells us not to give but only to take that creates our aggression that wants to be in control that creates all the negative feelings and thoughts gr expressed this idea in an astonishing way and has shown that the only way to gain true control is when you loose control and you just let go of your personal importance a superb movie
7,though not seen in too many films prior you have certainly seen the basic plot themes in too many films since br br not one of grants nor loys best films they make an outstanding effort together after all with that much talent and very good supporting cast you know the laughs will be therebr br the film is light has some dramatic spotting but keeps the plot moving and gets you to smile the whole way throughbr br a great example of classic american film fare that has stood the test of timebr br definite saturday afternoon fare heavy on the popcorn

4,if you want mindless action hot chicks and a postapocalyptic view of seattle then this is the show for youbr br the concept of dark angel isnt anything new in fact theres controversy over whether james cameron stole the idea from a book but i spend the entire hour watching it every tuesday from start to finishbr br jessica alba is smoking and max friends original cindy kendra are just as hot br br the fight scenes are getting better but the dialogues between original cindy and max need to be a little bit better the slang sounds forced and it sounds like someone living in the suburbs wrote itbr br in my opinion dark angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for but if youre looking for hard hitting awardwinning drama go watch the west wing or something
7,why the crap is this movie rated so low ive seen this movie over 25 times i know every line to this movie its obvious that i love this movie trey parker and matt stone creators of south park and the new puppet masterpiece team america star as the main characters joe cooper or coop airman cooper and doug remer or sir swish mainly theyre just referred to as coop and remer throughout the movie right as the movie starts it reminds us of the money hungry corrupt world of overpaid sports starts they even go as far as to make one up called townsell i must quote this portion of the movie since it is true with some sports starts and after playing for new england san diego huston saint louis a year for the toronto arganauts plus one season as a greater at the desert inn im happy to finally play here in the fine city of miami his agent leans over minnesota let us not forget this important piece of the movie so it starts that coop and remer are at a high school reunion party and realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old classmates outside they create the sport baseketball after being challenged by what probably was high school basketball heroes after shaming them the sport goes pro in about a year during this time they manage to recruit their third team mate squeak which is actually a day after they invent the game as the movie follows we find out that coop remer and squeak are the only virtuous sports heroes left the story follows with zany blackmail the milwaukee beers cheerleaders and humor so absurd itll leave you crying for more watch it dude its hilarious
0,this movie is so stupid it simply goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous i wanted to watch darkness falls actually and thought that this was the movie boy what a mistake i fastforwarded as much as i could and still i couldnt get rid of the boring moments i just envy the people who was paid to play in or work on this movie they were actually given money for this crap isnt that amazing i mean in this movie a man gets killed and chopped in a woodgrinder to little bloody pieces and few minutes later the mother and the kid talk calmly at the table as nothing happened and drink coffee please come on who gives money for such crap movies oh and the toothfairy was lame not scary at all and was obvious that it is a bored stuntman wearing a badly made makeup
5,i think that that creators of this films concept deserves a lot more accolades than they probably ever received it isnt an oscar caliber film of course but at least for me this film has left a lasting impression since i first saw it back in 1984 in the theatre br br i dont think this is and hope it isnt a spoiler but imagine acting on your impulses doing the first thought that pops into your head saying the first words on your lips no restraint no conscious nothing holding you back from saying or doing the things that as intelligent adults we know we shouldnt actually say or do if anything this film only scratches the surface  it doesnt go as far as it could go br br in a time when hollywood seems obsessed with remaking older classics to try and cash in on today wouldnt it be nice to see them remake an older film of modest success for the sake of taking it to the next level a bit further or even to explore what the original crew didnt wouldnt or couldnt deal with 20 years ago br br thats just my opinion anyway o
1,to begin with i loved gta kanal it had a lot of classic jokes including that unlucky guy in the canoe who always seems to be at the wrong place at the wrong time he is still acting the same guy in the gta kanal movie but in my opinion hes performance is not as funny as it was in the first movie in fact you dont notice him much at all a thing that made me think bad about this movie is the choice of boats in this movie there are only race boats they sure is speedy but those do not make waves like the big floating mansions used in the first movie i liked the old ones better and these new boats makes one of the last scenes look ridiculous when the man in the canoe suddenly jumps out of it to evade the big waves from those small speedy boats truly a minus you have to accept that were not living in the same sweden as in 1974 anymore this movie also contains a bit more violence than the first one although the movie was great all in all ive just concentrated on some cons that i was disappointed in but the rest of the movie were up to my expectations so go see it its worth the money
2,this movie was beautiful it was full of memorable imagery good acting and touching subject matter it would be very easy to write it off as being too sentimental but that is the sentiments this type of a movie is trying to achieve i was totally involved in the storys unfolding and presentation there were a few cheesy shots but such is to be expected in a religious propaganda film the only complaint i can conjure is there wasnt a ton of details however this movie wasnt created to explain every element of joseph smiths life ministry triumphs controversies failures etc it was designed for a quick glimpse at a few highlights of one of the most amazing american and historical religious figures of all time
7,four best friends young male chauvinist pigs with the emphasis on pigs meet weekly at a nyc diner to recount their dating sexploits in this misanthropic and visceral comedy peet is the common denominator who dates the three bachelors in the group which leads to conflict and the inevitable whipping although the films premise has potential and there are some funny moments to be had overall the flick doesnt work especially in the end where the girls are made to appear no better than the guys which runs contrary to the crux of the story one of those oneman band flix with a dozen producers whipped is likely to be enjoyed only by the kind of young males who think the man show is emmy material
7,a small funny film it is totally incredible unbelievable impossible but it is funny how an introverted masochist can become totally dependent and mesmerized even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows but who was able to get down into his phantasms of course it is a denunciation of the foolish deals you can get to on the internet you must not believe ten percent of what youre told there and never ever ever accept to tie up your hands in a way or another to someone or something or some organization you do not know personally most of their businesses there are in a way or another going to fool you and raid you but here the chap deserves being the victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive he is absurdly silly but then the film becomes funny because it ends up with the victim of the crooked business having the upper hand and ending up playing the same game with his victimizer and winning one think is sure too security in english airports is not exactly what it should be but i guess its not better anywhere else in the world and even now they have tightened up all rules and regulations it is just fun to go through their procedures and foil them systematically then they have their vengeance by losing your luggage a real plague on modern airports and dont expect to get fair compensation or even confiscating a bottle opener or a can opener because it may be dangerous i can see myself cutting my way through the side of the plane with a can opener funny isnt it dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris pantheon sorbonne  university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
6,made in 1946 and released in 1948 the lady and shanghai was one of the big films made by welles after returning from relative exile for making citizen kane dark brooding and expressing some early cold war paranoia this film stands tall as a filmnoir crime film the cinematography of this film is filled with welles characteristic quirks of odd angles quick cuts long pans and sinister lighting the use of ambient street music is a precursor to the incredible long opening shot in touch of evil and the mysterious chinese characters and the sequences in chinatown can only be considered as the inspiration in many ways to roman polanskis chinatown unfortunately it is welles obsession with technical filmmaking that hurts this film in its entirety the plot of this story is often lost behind a sometimes incomprehensible clutter of film techniquesbr br however despite this criticism the story combined with wonderful performances by welles hayworth and especially glenn anders laughter make this film a joy to watch orson welles pulls off not only the irish brogue but the torn identities as the honest but dangerous sailor rita hayworth who was married to welles at the time breaks with her usual roles as a sex goddess and takes on a role of real depth and contradictions finally glenn anders strange and bizarre portrayal or elsas husbands law partner is nothing short of classic
0,this is the biggest pile of crap i have ever watched do not rent the makers of this movie should be band from ever making another movie it starts with some what of a plot then fades fast to nothing i think i would rather watch paint dry then to as much as looking at the cover the actors were awful the plot faded fast filming left to much work to be done not one good thing to say about this crap movie if you rent this movie you will waste your money i really enjoy national lampoon movies but this was a waste of time learn to write learn to act learn to produce and learn to direct i feel i should sue these aholes that made this movie for money wasted on rental cost and time lost
7,this film plays really well with an audience especially once the chase begins plus trevor howard with his sensible smart charms and jean simmons with her innocent demeanor and piercing eyes are terrific togetherbr br the film starts as a psychological drama but after the murder it segues into a chase thriller as the two leads head for the border some may think the chase is superfluous but actually the chase is essential because it aids in clearing the mind of the jean simmons character by getting her out of the oppressive household plus it helps bring out the real killer  who is suddenly put into such a position that they have to finish the job the killer rightly believed that once the simmons character was arrested she would be put away and it is true that her lack of control in the household  as well as evidence pointing her way  there is no way she would have gotten out of the murder charge the chase that ensues helps bring out the truthbr br this is an entertaining film seek it out if you can find it
3,im not sure that this comment contains an actual spoiler but im playing it safe so dont read this if you havent seen the moviebr br i adore this movie and so does everyone i work with  and that is the point i spent a large part of my working life in cinema without being an actor such people are the _sung_ heroes of this movie the gaffers the pullers the onair directors the lighters and writers the costume people etc etc and the whole thing is told from their point of view at least to a great extent most actors are nuts and selfabsorbed to the point of absurdity which is what this movie spoofs so well but you have to have worked with actors to recognize that this movie is reallife drama possible spoiler alert in one great scene the two leads both actors are _discussing_ how to _discuss_ something personal something entirely outofscript with another actor and they start making up lines rehearsing them and critiquing each others performancebr br since this movie appeared in what was it 91 it has become fashionable to do this especially on tv but hardly anyone has done it so well
7,i have been familiar with the fantastic book of goodnight mister tom for absolutely ages and it was only recently when i got the chance to watch this adaption of it i have heard lots of positive remarks about this so i had high hopes once this film had finished i was horrifiedbr br this film is not a good film at all goodnight mister tom was an extremely poor adaption and practically 4510 of the book was missed out particularly i found that a lot of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this there was not much dialogue it was rushed and far too fastmoving but i was mostly upset by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between william beech and tom in this film which was a true let down the casting was not all that goodeither i thought this could have been really good but it was so different to the book anextremely poor adaption one of the worst ive seen this deserves a decent remake thatd better be 1000 times better than this pile of garbage
7,the melting mana tragic victim of the space race he perished meltingnever comprehending the race had long gone bybr br a man burr debenning burns his hand on the kitchen stove but instead of screaming something a normal person would scream he shouts something that sounds like aaaaatchkah this movie youve popped inisnt a normal movie youve just taken your first step into the incredible melting man the famous late70s gore film featuring rick bakers wonderful makeup effects baker was just on the edge of becoming a superstar and did this at the same time as his famous cantina aliens in star wars for some strange reason star wars became a household name and incredible melting man did not br br it might have something to do with the fact that this movie is just mindnumbingly awful from the opening credits starring alex rebar as the incredible melting manthats really what it says to the chubby nurse running through a glass door to the fishermans head going over a waterfall and smashing graphically apart on some rocks this film provides many many moments of sheer incomprehensibility why did theybut how come hewhy are they after a while you give up wondering why and watch it as what it isa very entertaining piece of garbagebr br an astronaut returns to earth in a melting radioactive condition he escapes and his mind disintegrating as well as his body begins a mad melting killing spree the authorities quickly decide that the melting man must be stopped but probably not wanting to cause a panic want him captured as quietly as possible so they send one guy with a geiger counter after him wowbr br storywise surprisingly little happens during the movie the melting guy wanders around killing people a doctor searches for him with a geiger counter various characters are introduced ask questions and leave eventually the doctor catches up with the melting man but is shot by a security guard for no reason after he explains that hes dr ted nelson the melting man wanders off and finally dissolves into a big puddle of goo the endbr br its so brainless that it somehow ends up being a lot of fun despite a fairly downbeat ending supposedly a widescreen dvd release is planned a very special movie
1,for muslim women in western africa married life at the hands of abusive husbands can be very hard  the community may not explicitly endorse such behaviour but equally they may not yet be ready to see it as criminal an attitude which of course enables it to continue fortunately the letter of the cameroonian law promises equality to all and this documentary follows the real life exploits of various female practitioners in the cameroonian legal system as they attempt to secure justice for a number of women and children what is notable apart from the uplifting central story is how in spite of their informality the courts are actually pragmatically progressive if a case is actually bought the program also gives a fascinating insight the whole cameroonian lifestyle which aside from the awful crimes committed in the featured cases seems amazingly emotional and joyous compared with that enjoyed by inhabitants of europe or north america and while i concede that this comment may betray naivet on my part this attitude appears to be captured in delightful pidginenglish they speak overall this is a terrific little film and much more fun to watch than you might imagine
4,fabulous costumes by edith head who painted them on liz taylor at her finestbr br the sfx are very good for a movie of its age and the stunt doubles actually looked like the actors even down to body type a rarity in movies of this vintagebr br a cozy movie with splendid panoramas  even when chopped down to pan and scan
6,when i first saw this film it was not an impressive one now that i have seen it again with some friends on dvd  they had not viewed it on the silver screen  my opinion remains the same the subject matter is puerile and the performances are weak
0,stargate sg1 is a spin off of sorts from the 1994 movie stargate i am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject the show gets it rolling from the very first episode a retired jack oneill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion dr daniel jackson through the first two episodes we meet samantha carter a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her and there is tealc a quiet compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team br br the main bad guys are called the gouald they are parasites who can get inserted into ones brain thus controlling them and doing evil deeds any gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a system lord the warriors behind the gouald are called jaffa who house the parasitic gouald in their bodies until the gouald can get inserted in a persons brainbr br through the episodes we mostly get to see sg1 the exploratory team comprised of jackdanieltealcand sam go through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets this device is called the stargate and they encounter new cultures or bad guys some episodes are onworld meaning that they do not go through the stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on earthbr br through the years you start to see a decline in the sg1 team as close knit and more characterbuilding story lines this in turn means even more onworld episodes which is perfectly understandablebr br my rating 87510while most of this show is good there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years but still top notch science fiction
1,the extraordinary rosemary forsyth is the main reason to see this flick why she never became a bigger store may never be known but she is exceptional and steals every scene shes in garson kanin directed this piece of fluff and the cast is first rate with robert drivas and brenda vaccaro especially memorable a out of 10
4,i like the time period i like the attempt but watching a movie that looks like im looking at it through a coke bottle gives me a headache if i played computer games that were this blurry and out of focus i would upgrade my computer could be that this was the look the director was after but not so it hurts the eyes and you want to leave after 10 minutes if i hadnt taken someone with me to this film i was out of there even though it was a series and not a movie per say band of brothers accomplished this they made it look like wwii footage with just a touch of graininess but it was still a pleasure to watch movies need real people with real sets and real locations use cgi when it is appropriate not for an entire film
6,i could not believe how awful this film was i rarely watch commercial tv but thought well diane keaton is always worth watching i stand corrected everyone involved should be hanging their heads in shamebr br i realize there are not a lot of great roles for women of a certain age but the script to this was so inept clichd and baffling that i am surprised it ever got into development or that ms keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of this sows ear none of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly unlikeable the acting looked like exercises in a beginning class  i stared in openmouthed horror through most of this wondering what were they thinking very very sad that it has come to this dont waste your time
6,the film did not do well at the box officebr br i saw it in a sneak previewbr br i have always enjoyed the filmbr br i live in of the cities mentioned in the film where past players moved tobr br not the best film ever put to screen but enjoyablebr br robin did well with his rolebr br best line of the film at the beginning by robins character jack i was that sob cleaned up here as not to offend anyonebr br was glad when it came to dvd a few years back in the wide screenletter box formatbr br i am not a football fan or a real sports fan but you do not need to be one to like this film
1,whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about lucille ball especially her autobiography ive never seen so many mistakes in a biopic ranging from her early years in celoron and jamestown to her later years with desi i could write a whole list of factual errors but it would go on for pages in all i believe that lucille ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves if i were lucie arnaz and desi jr i would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film the filmmakers tried hard but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me
7,i mean really either i suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie its stupid ridiculous and just not funny at allbr br since i saw the preview i knew it wasnt going to be a great movie i just didnt think it was gonna be that badbr br what happened to the good old times when you could find clever funny lines at any movie when the actors didnt have to play ridiculous roles in attempt to be funny now we find ourselves with movies like this one borat little men scary movie where i could not find the funny partsbr br just skip this piece of garbagebr br ps sorry for my english
0,this movie is a perfect portrayal of the nutcracker the dancing is wonderful the scenery in the background was excellent and i loved that floating bedbr br oh and the costumes i particularly loved marzipans the tutu was adorable the special effects were very well done eg the tree the bed etc and i quite enjoyed the rats i love how they didnt make them scary but cute and huggable except for the king i supposebr br if youre a thoroughly masculine person you wont enjoy this but this is a very good movie thats good for all ages  just not all levels of testosteronebr br but i have a few complaintsbr br firstly why did they have to put the sugar plum fairys partner in those terrible tights it would barely make a difference if he was butt naked and secondly why on earth did they have to make culkins outfit pink
7,i didnt know if i would laugh or cry seeing this only addicted fans of danni filth could have a taste for this this is supposed to be a horror movie but theres only filth in this the most cool scene is the car accident with real special effects from the best of hollywood avoid this movie at all costs see this only for studies of how bad can be a movie
6,this was a movie about infidelity and revenge a twin with the twin connection senses that something is wrong with her sister this movie took forever to establish the plot a plot that has been done many times the acting was lousy for the most part once the plot comes together the movie ends laura and ashley are twins that live with an abusive father the father seems to favor ashley so laura gets the blame for everything there is a promise made that the girls would never be apart but as they grow up their lives go in different directions ashley gets a job in a diner where she meets barry a married man of course no good can come of this the fact that barry had tinnitus was a poor excuse for a way to track him down i kept waiting for this movie to get better and for there to be some resolution somewhere but it never happened
2,god i was bored out of my head as i watched this pilot i had been expecting a lot from it as im a huge fan of james cameron and not just since titanic i might add and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality then again he also wrote the leaden strange days but the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration in all that time it barely went beyond its two line synopsis and i would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere on top of that i dont think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular ateam episode as for alba yes she is gorgeous of course but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie pouty and surly makes me also get bored of her gal wit an attitude schtick pretty soon you can count me out of this one mr cameron
7,dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love wanders is probably not the word i should say he fixates on the past girlfriend he recalls to the day when the relationship ended the dream sequences only lack the hazy transitions he fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went im not a counselor but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage dave goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half his age also divorced who instead of being turned off by his creepiness starts to become interested in him did i mention how creepy dave is he sometimes refers to himself in the third person he doesnt move his arms when he walks either its just weird too make a long story short dave plots to hunt down mary the old gal friend and kill hererri mean confront her he does so which was really creepy he believes her to be married yet he still flies halfway across the country to meet her he stakes out her house to make sure she is alone before he drops in on her he has an awkward conversation with her that ends with his sharing the gospel of christ in about 10 words or less and flies back to the new young girlfriend we enjoyed the movie mostly for unintentional comedic value i am still entertaining the wife with my dave impressionsi heard another dave  mary song
0,this movie is awesome for three main reasons it is esthetically beautiful i absolutely loved that there is a bold color theme throughout the movie with extraordinary costumes and picturesque sets a photography which looks very costly and probably was not completes the look  i always enjoy those stories about groups of misfitsloners coming together and becoming a family  sometimes they fall into clichs but this one does not this group of actors really portrays well flawed yet extremely likable characters alan larkin is the best between him  the van and the road movie theme i could not help but remember my favorite movie of last year little miss sunshine  i discovered fabrizio bentivoglio  very interesting actor and just got annoyed a tiny little bit by til schweiger performance at times  the opening scene all the scenes where they mess up their tricks are very funny there is a mix of humor and emotion throughout the film i like the end a lot and of course it is all about the magician theme  a good magician is making the audience look where he wants them to to create an illusion which happens to be exactly what a movie director does and thats why they call it movie magic
6,its a good movie maybe i like it because it was filmed here in pr the actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome the guy is cute too so its a good match if you want to the guy or the girls
3,this very low budget comedy caper movie succeeds only in being low budget dialog is dumbfoundingly stupid chase scenes are uniformly boring and most of the onscreen money seems to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot during the films last five minutes a briefly glimpsed portapotty early in that scene is certain to wrecked and spew crap on the films chief villainno prop is here without a purpose the whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those that occasionally came out of rodger cormans studio when hed give a first time director a few bucks and a camerabut without the discipline corman would impose
5,as always controversial movies like this have mixed reviews you either love it or you hate it and not everyone will like this movie this shows the perspective of the killers which is something i personally feel is something important to consider you may hate them you may claim to understand them and feel as though you can relate but regardless this movie will make you think about school shootings from a different perspectivebr br the movie is shot entirely using a handheld camera something that i think works quite well as it makes it more realistic it is told completely from the killers point of view from their missions to family outings all leading up the big day zero day in which they are planning on a massacre at their school zero day does not offer answers but merely presents a glimpse at the lives of two troubled young boys and lets the audience decide for themselves our feelings towards the boys are something mixed between sympathy and hatred but yet we are left confused as to why two ordinary young boys would do such a thing they are shown to be surprisingly normal typical teenage boys leading ordinary lives and if we didnt know what they were planning we wouldnt expect a thing they make it clear throughout the whole movie that noone else knows about their planbr br the acting is extremely good considering the two actors are complete unknowns we can only hope to see more work from the both of them in the future despite how this is a fictionalized movie one cannot help but notice the obvious similarities to columbine calvin and andre are scarily similar to eric harris and dylan klebold not so much in looks but in manner as someone who has researched columbine very extensively i could see the similarities and it is almost certainly based on it br br the actual massacre is shown through surveillance cameras at the school and is one of the most chilling things i have ever seen i was completely in shock after seeing it and its a feeling that stays around for a while it is very realistic and welldone and it is very difficult to watchbr br all in all zero day is an excellent movie and i think everyone should at least check it out in the past we have always simply branded killers psychopaths and assumed that either they were biologically wired for disaster or had media influence but as zero day shows sometimes the motives are deeper than that and we can never truly understand why tragedies such as school shootings happen until we have seen it from the perspective of the killers
7,i really enjoyed this episode seeing the flash cyborg green arrow and aquaman even though all he did was swim made my eyes widen to see most of the founders of the justice league trying to bring down lex luthor is what ive been waiting for this sounds a bit off topic but making a live action justice league show would definitely make me have a reason to shove everything that i usually do during the week down the drain just to watch one episode this is the thrill i got from watching this episode i wish they had made this episode a little longer like a two hour special because i felt that one hour of the justice league wasnt enough now before i bore you unless i already have with my rambling i just want to say smallville is cool again it sort of lost its touch when the show started focusing on lana but im sure the writers will just fall back into that loop hole  so enjoy this episode who knows when another good ones going to come out catch it again this thursday feb 22 if you missed the first airing
5,i didnt think it could be done but something has come along and replaced open house a low budget horror about someone killing over the high price of real estate as the worst film ive ever seen in my short but otherwise sweet lifebr br it was touted as the best film in montreals most recent film festival which leads me to believe that every other entry must consist of blankwall shots accompanied by people reading gloomy poetrybr br watching this movie was like a little slice of hell its from austria and it attempts to stumble along in the footsteps of short cuts and blue velvet scenes about various characters living in a suburban area with a dark underbelly theres the fat dog owner and his fat maid wife who stripteases for him the skinny divorcee whose wife still lives with him in a house that includes the untouched room of his dead child the berannoying woman hitchhiker who recites top ten lists the list goes on forever much like the two hours plus i spent in that theatrebr br yes the characters interact but not in a clever or interesting or even relevant way i couldnt say if they were any good as actors as according to the subtitles they were given lines that were the austrian equivalent of you are so lame they certainly didnt have to learn many as each repeated his or her same lines at least three times in a scenebr br this is no gummo or any of the aforementioned movies there is no art to discover and nothing to dwell on afterwards except maybe whether or not you should change your never walk out during a movie policy which quite a few older couples did during a random orgy scene and if that sounds appetizing its not unless youre one of few who doesnt find the idea of your parents having sex and with a few local middleaged couples to boot revoltingbr br this movie was offensive to me not the flabby nudity not the cringeinducing soundtrack not the shockless scenes involving guns i was offended that someone actually spent money to make this when there are capable writers and filmmakers out there looking for funding i was offended that someone from out of town might have gone to see dog days and come out wondering if that was the best us montrealers could find most of all i was offended that somehow the people involved with the festival duped everyone into believing that the emperor had a gorgeous and mesmerising new outfit when it was painfully clear that he was as naked as the fat maid wife doing a stripteasebr br

1,im gonna make this short and sweet because i dont think there is much you can really tell someone about this show who has never seen it other than its hilariously funny and unique for me its possibly the funniest show everbr br you have to really watch it to understand its humour and it took me a few episodes to really get into it but once your in there is no getting back out for example the way hydes character always wants to see his friends get in some sort of trouble the more it happens the funnier it becomesbr br its all round classic i mean the cast the writers the director its just a recipe for success one actor i think who always gets a hard time is ashton kutcher but i mean hes great in this show i dont think its possible for the the character kelso to have been played by anyone else it takes someone very smart to play someone that stupid all the main characters are great and it wouldnt be a worth while review if i didnt mention the stone cold fox mila kunis now thats a spicy meet a ball ha ha all joking aside amazing show
1,youd be forgiven to think a finnish director from helsinki would be no good at directing an american horror movie especially one entirely located inside a us prison  see this to prove yourself wrong it was produced in the 80s after all and the film was made on a budget more fitting to a modern diy company tv advert something i think anyone would really notice nowadays what with practically everyone being accustomed to 100m budgets for action movies unfortunately dominating the industry mind being mr harlins first major production and the  at least what nowadays would be considered a stellar  cast i still think most of the nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole is more to do with stellan stargaards screen appearances not mentioning the well overrated mrs bergman directorial efforts  at least for all female viewers  but this flick really proves there does exist proper movie talent outside of the us and hollywood to make us watch a film in suspense do try and watch this movie even if youre not a horror puff imo its definitely worth it
0,i just watched antwone fisher on bravo what an awesome movie and incredible young man this movie is a must see for anyone who is dealing with how to overcome childhood abuse and abandonment as an adult denzel washington puts in an outstanding performance as well as the young man who plays antwone fisher kleenex alertfeel good and tearful the most heartrending moment is when he finally meets his mother who he was taken away from at months of age and one of the most courageous was when he stood up to his abusive foster mother and sister i saw this movie on bravo in 2008 and only wish i had known about it years ago definitely a movie to add to my dvd collection
6,this piece aint really worth a comment its simply the worst horror movie i have ever seen the actors are bad as bad can be and the whole plot is so silly it nearly made me cry shame on you i say
5,a series of random seemingly insignificant thefts at her sisters boarding house has miss lemon quite agitated a ring light bulbs a rucksack a lighter a stethoscope a shoe  there seems to be no rhyme or reason to any of it miss lemon asks her employer the great belgian detective hercule poirot to look into the matter but what poirot sees is something far more sinister than miss lemon could have imagined and poirots fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the boarding house if found murdered its up to poirot to bring a killer to justicebr br hickory dickory dock is a solid but not spectacular entry in the long running poirot series i appreciate how faithful the script is to agatha christies original story i realize that certain liberties had to be taken but i appreciate the effort nonetheless the major points of the mystery are all there  the petty thefts the boarding house the students the ripped rucksack and of course poirots ability to see something sinister going on before it actually happens with a few exceptions the cast of students is almost as i pictured them damian lewis and jessica lloyd standout among the group as mush as i always enjoy david suchets poirot i get a real kick out of the episodes with phillip jacksons inspector japp and pauline morans miss lemon this episode is a real treat as miss lemon gets more screen time than usual finally i enjoyed the use of the ever present mouse as an observer of the activities in the hostel its a fun little play on the hickory dickory dock titlebr br i realized while rewatching hickory dickory dock just what a tremendous influence agatha christies work was on the highly stylized italian mystery films or gialli of the 60s and 70s take the murder of mrs nicoletis as an example if you were to bump up the graphic nature of the scene you would have something straight out of an early 70s giallo in fact the entire plot of hickory dickory dock could have been used in a giallo its just convoluted and interesting enough to have worked

7,if mr cranky had rated this id be tempted just to copy his review and paste it here but as he hasnt ill have to give it a go myselfbr br the only thing giving this movie a instead of a is that malcolm mcdowalls acting is excellent however not even he can save this film from disaster the director must have been really distracted when he worked on this one because it is just a conglomeration of scenes that were thrown together with very little continuity  reminiscent of bad 70s movies even worse both the actors and director appeared to be making it up as they went along which probably showed how bad the original script wasbr br its not even worth discussing the story line although it revolves around a futuristic corporation called the proxate corporation who put together a crew of dispensable people to carry a dangerous cargo on an old containerslave ship to nigeria this ships computer is a baby kept in a glass jar and wired into one of the crew via usb 12 or something the company should have been called the prostate corporation as the entertainment value of this movie is on a par with an examination of the same namebr br i honestly cant find one scene that i could say was well made and made any real sense in the context of the movie i only watched it to the end as i had a touch of the bird flu and this movie reminded me that there were people out there who were actually worse off than me  malcolm mcdowall in particular i wont hold this against him as hes a great actor and every great actor is entitled to one bad movie in their career and this one is a doosiebr br so unless this is the only movie your shop hires out or youre male and youre doctor isnt doing prostate examinations this week and you somehow feel this is a bad thing then give this one a really wide berth unless of course if youre really community minded buy a copy to support malcolm and then use it as a drink coaster
2,ok the director remakes love actually the director nikhil advani after debuting with khnh does his second half and waitbr br he makes a 330 hours  film which loses on patience timeetc the viewer seems like a hrs sleep watching this filmbr br ok they had stories so it was necessary but why storiesbr br we have the anil juhi story convincing but boring dont tv serials show such storiesbr br we have govinda shannon story which is funny and works well br br we have akshayeayesha story again believable but gets boring soon and the focus is on comedy more and that too slapstick boring comedybr br we have salman priyanka story which is the worst not just acting terms it makes no sense at allbr br we have sohail isha story to make you laugh and the trick works at times thanks to the boredom set by most of other storiesbr br we have john vidya story a good story in all respectsbr br but then by the time all stories come in bits n pieces the viewer gets bored and sleepy the climax isnt appealing though especially the climax of salman priyanka story nikhil advanis handling is alright at places some stories are well handled but weak at places musicselis good but too many songs cinematography is nice every story is given a different look texture and it worksbr br actors govinda rocks after a dismissal comeback with bb he actually makes you laugh and love him in this film despite his age and weight anil kapoor acts his part well though he looks out of shape and tired john excels in his part akshaye khanna overacts for a changebr br sohail khan is too over the  top and isha has nothing to do anjana suknani is dismissalbr br priyanka and salman deserve an award for this film you are shockedbr br salman khan doesnt act only just talks like he is in his sleep and that fake accent oh god priyanka overacts to such a standard you feel like throwing something on her she does get better towards the end vidya balan is good juhi chawla is okay shannon is okay
7,maybe its the dubbing or maybe its the endless scenes of people crying moaning or otherwise carrying on but i found europa 51 to be one of the most overwrought and therefore annoying films ive ever seen the film starts out promisingly if familiarly as mom ingrid bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled brat of a son sandro franchina whilst mummy and daddy bland alexander knox entertain their guests at a dinner party the youngster tries to kill himself setting in motion a life changing series of events that find bergman spending time showering compassion on the poor and needy spurred on by communist newspaper editor andrea ettore giannini she soon spends more time with the downtrodden than she does with her husband who soon locks her up in an insane asylum for her troubles bergman plays the saint role to the hilt echoing her 1948 role as joan of arc and rossellini does a fantastic job of lighting and filming her to best effect unfortunately the script pounds its point home with hamfisted subtlety as andrea and mom take turns declaiming marxist and christian platitudes by the final tear soaked scene i had had more than my fill of these tiresome characters a real step down for rossellini as he stepped away from neorealism and further embraced the mythical and mystical themes of 1950s flowers of st francis
2,christopher lloyd is funny and really believable as al the head angel this movie is much better than the first but it has great special effects that the first did not have as well as a much better plot and writingbr br ok  it was written for kids but adults have as much fun as the kids do tony danza does a very realistic job in his role  but this is not a taxi reunionbr br danny glover is actually good and even seems to be very human in his emotions as well as showing some real acting talent for a change a pleasant changebr br watch at least once  it is worth the effort to catch it
6,this documentary is a proof of talent being used for mean purposes the fact that it is financed by the venezuelan government gives it a lack of legitimacy in the purpose of searching for the truth of what really happened those horrible days of april 2002 in venezuela something even we venezuelans dont know for surebr br there are ways of lying and the directors of this stuff lie both by omission and by knowledge br br the venezuelan political process is too complex to be easily understood by foreign audiences and they take advantage of that for instance possible spoilers they show prochvez demonstrators shooting at an empty street what the hell they did that for in a way of saying they didnt kill anyone but didnt bother showing the images we all saw here of opposition demonstrators and a journalist falling dead or injured at the other side of that empty street they cant explain why the chopper of the political police was the only one authorised to fly over caracas that day and did nothing against the snipers that were all over the roofs of the buildings nearby the presidential palace something that would exhibit how inefficient would be the security measures to guard the president a few days after the coup the chief of the military guard in charge was asked at the national assembly our congress why didnt they act against the snipers and he said cause they werent there to act against the president isnt that a confessionbr br there is so much more the fact that the highest rank military announced that chvez had resigned and days later he said he had lied because thats politics and nowadays is the minister of internal affairs of chvez administrationbr br it would take me thousands of words to explain all the lies depicted in this documentary made with the intention of selling the world an image of the good old hugo chvez who rules for the poor and the bad rich opposition that wants him out at all costs when the truth is that 6070 of people rejects his government and that percentage includes the poorbr br i hope those of you who have seen and bought this will be able to see a different version that is being made by a group of venezuelan people showing no less than 30 liesbr br nazi propaganda has returned
2,first off anyone looking for meaningful outcome oriented cinema that packs some sort of social message with meaningful performances and soul searching dialog spoken by dedicated emotive heartfelt thespians please leave now you are wasting your time and life is short go see the new brangelina jolie movie have a good cry go out  buy a hybrid car or throw away your conflict diamonds if that will make you feel better and leave us alonebr br dont let the door hit you on the way out either the incredible melting man is a grade b minus regional horror epic shot in the wastelands of oklahoma by a young tv friendly cast  crew and concerns itself with an astronaut who is exposed to bizarre radiation effects wakes up in a hospital and finds that his body is liquefying on him as he sits there feeling like a chump the melting man is played by one alex rebar who is recognizable for about the first four minutes of the film but once he starts oozin with rick bakers extraordinary special effects makeup he more resembles something you might find in a tin of spam before you drain off all the runny viscous blebs of greasebr br the film has zero exposition and does not bandy about with plot points there are a couple of scenes involving scientist types riding around on an absurd industrial conveyor machine who dutifully recite a few obligatory lines about the effects of radiation but the movie does not care really its a freak show and a marvelous one at that with a decidedly sick sense of humor for those who can stomach it  one great laugh comes when the melting man stumbles upon a young girl in the forest and is so at a loss for what to do that one of his eyes pops out hilariousbr br the hero of the film is played by burr debenning a fascinating character actor from the golden 1970s  80s television scene who was sort of an early model for the kevin spacey prototype slightly twisted neurotic and one step ahead of most everyone in the room even if he looks confused he appeared just after this movie was made in a bizarre made for tv anthology horror piece called house of the dead or the alien zone that is regarded as one of the finest movies ever made in oklahoma which is where i suspect this film was made as well the arid cold looking rural midwestern landscapes are certainly the same and the creek that one unfortunate fly fisher chooses for his afternoon of sport appears to be the same one that cameron mitchell fought off flying alien pancakes in without warning  which also had a sick sense of humor a tv friendly cast and some pretty outrageous gore i definitely sense at least an aesthetic connection between the three movies as well as the silence of the lambs which is of no surprise considering that director jonathan demme is a part of melting mans castbr br essentially as others have pointed out this is a 1950s b movie plot updated for later 1970s era special effects  the inevitable boobs the movie it probably borrows most of its ideas from is phantom from space with peter graves as an astronaut who also returns to earth after being exposed to funky radiation effects that set him off on a killing spree one of the things that i actually admire about the film is that absolutely no regard is given for the melting mans motivations he simply goes on a rampage and the movies drama comes from wondering if hes going to fall to pieces before certain characters fall victim to his madness the budget for the film is also delightfully low and every dime spent on it is up there on the screen rick bakers disgusting effects getting the lions share of whatever was spent on thisbr br sick disgusting fun best enjoyed with a crowd of friends and plenty of beer why cant people have made more movies like these br br 810
6,look its the third one so you already know its bad and maniac cop wasnt good enough to warrant the second installment so you know its even worse but how much worse awful approaching godawfulbr br when maniac cop goes on a killing spree a reporter exclaims what happened here can only be described as a black rainbow of deathbr br rainbows are not black and can never be rainbows are harmless and can never inflict pain or death a news reporter one valuable to his agency might find another way to describe the aftermath of a killing spree a black rainbow of death is not the only way to describe the given situationbr br this is what youre in for
7,this was a blind buy used dvd it totally killed a nice buzz i had going when i hit playbr br its bubbleheaded comedy but its um squalid the plot is zany but the characters do things to each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently contrived i ultimately found it depressing to watchbr br maybe the box lead me to expect something more than an uneven goofy caper film i know i know the quotes on the box  the academy award nomination mean nothing
0,i could name plenty of funny movies there are comedies that set out to be funny and are some movies like a gymkata for example try to be serious but end up funny the ladies man is a film that is desperately trying to be funny but could not be less funny if it was about a guy who got a lot of chicks in the middle of the wreckage of a nuclear holocaust its antifunnybr br i dont think i laughed harder than a chuckle at anything in this movie its simply unfunny its boring stupid inane annoying mindbogglingly bad but not funny i dont particularly care for tim meadows or this character from snl but i expected better than thisbr br the movie is completely lacking logic or common sense its like the script writer had a bag over his head while he was typing and he couldnt see which keys he was hitting they tell the origin of the ladies man but fail to include a motivation for his bizarre fascination with acting like its still the seventies the movie tries to get humor out of a man who appears to pleasuring himself to porn shortly after he tried to hang himself this is comedy i like to consider myself having a pretty keen sense of humor spending a lot of time writing comedy as i do but maybe im just not quite bright enough for this filmbr br lee evans so funny as tucker in theres something about mary is outrageously bad here i was pleading with him in my head to shut upbr br by the end i was pounding on my chair muttering under my breath and had the film gone on any longer would probably have attempted suicide this film might not be as bad as battlefield earth but its the first movie ive seen thats come closebr br 
1,the title of this film nearly put me off watching it not being a manchester united fan the mere mention of beckham was a bit off putting however i put my prejudices behind me and im glad i didbr br i wasnt expecting much of a film but i was pleasantly surprised the film sped along with me never looking at my watch and i enjoyed every second of the film if you liked east is east then youll love this film ok so the storyline is nothing new and the classic storylines are contained within the film but its all done very funnily and with a breath of fresh air the film moves very fast and keeps the audiance entertained the occaisional funny moments are a good chuckle and not some poor attempt at humour and best of all its a good british comedy
1,a gradez horror filmmaker carl monson was one of the most prolific directors operating within the field of the lowbudget gory mayhemhis movies are full of inept gorelaughable actingboring subplots and woeful dialoguea mysterious black clad figure is savagely murdering guests staying at the family mansionunfortunately this film is almost bloodlessyou dont actually see the murders except with shadows and a few blood splattersthe pace is lethargic and the plot is rather uninterestingthe acting is merely competentbut the lack of gore and mutilation left me disappointeda generous out of 10just bewaredo not mistake monsons film with andy milligans equally weak legacy of blood
2,i only today picked this up at the 99 cents only store today and i still think i got ripped off dream to believe is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and is just too freakin expensive for this this film is probably only notable for things it has a young keanu reeves and its directed by paul lynch the man who also did promo night now onto the movie br br its about a girl named robin played by olivia dabo who is badly injured from a car accident that also cost her fathers life so the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastic tournaments she is often picked on during her classes and eventually she meets some wild kid named tommy played by keanu robin when not in training works parttime along with her mother and stepsister at a laundromat owned by her abusive stepfather eventually she is chosen to compete br br overall keanu alone and some catchy 80s tunes are what prevent me from giving this star and its also not one of the worst movies ever but still far from good the dvd itself is not getting any medals either as it appears to be sourced from an old vhs and towards the end the sound goes out of sync and when the end credits are almost over it fades to black even though sound can still be heard so this can probably be passed as a bootleg the dvd artwork makes no sense either as it has what appears to be recent photos of keanu and olivia and the background has nothing to do with the movie as its also not in the movie itself so the covers obviously photoshopped in any case avoid at all costs unless youre a keanu fanatic i probably wont be hanging to it any longer im probably gonna give it to the cinema snob whos a great yt critic btw hey if any of you have any crappy movies that they no longer want in their sight feel free to donate to him to keep his show running
4,i went into this film with expectations from the hype that it would be insightful and uplifting certainly something more than a cheap promotional for the band wilcobr br instead we get a lot of moping and whining about the process a dishonorable and no doubt onesided portrayal of one band members who was kicked out by the prima donna lead singersongwriter a gutwrenching confession by the fallen members friend  for like 18 years  saying the friendship had run its course and this whiny uncompelling story about how one record label hurt their feelings by dumping them only so that the band could immediately get 50 offers from other labels oh the tensionnot they tried their best to make it look like it was a strain but i suspect it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that didnt exist this doesnt even take into account the long stretches where we get many of their newest songs shoved at us in full without any storyline insight or even a decent job at cinematography the strained attempts at emotional sincerity or reasonable perspective on life made me sick to watchbr br from the film this band sounds like a bunch of vile little babies who poke around to find a voice they dont have and think theyre some kind of guardians for the art of music which they most definitely are not and i thought the music sucked and i couldnt even understand the lyrics due to the mumbling style of the lead singerbr br i give it a 210
6,well where do i start i think its very insulting to the original annie with aileen quimnn i love the film annie and i was expecting this to be a brilliant film but i was so disappointed the acting is awful the original annie came out a few years before i was born im now 25 and annie is still one of my favourite films so i was really excited to see annie the acting was awful in the film were any of the characters original very badly written directed and acted this is not a film i wish to see again and any annie lover i recommend that you dont watch this film because it will only leave you very disappointed the young girls singing isnt bad but still doesnt compare to the original
7,in a word this film was boring it lacked life and spark a big problem is with the two leads jude law and gwyneth paltrow had no chemistry whatsoever he was boring and she was annoying br br the visuals were interesting but they didnt enhance the scenes if anything the visuals tended to detach the audience from what was happening on screen none of the action sequences felt real and hence the film failed to create any real drama or a sense of dangerbr br the film had potential but it needed a better script better acting and a better director i kept thinking during the film you know this movie wouldve worked if harrison ford was sky captain karen allen was polly and steven spielberg was the director br br ignore the critical acclaims for this film the critics i think are praising the film because they want to like it and want it to succeed even though it fails on so many different levels
2,take young pretty people put them in an exotic locale stick in a few bad guys have the two lead characters find romance after a couple of heavy breathing scenes create the flimsiest of plots then work out a happy ending for everybody other than the three or four who get murdered of course thats the classic and successful format of the harlequin romance its not very good but then its not very bad either like most of the little yellow pocket books and the location stuff in budapest is especially interesting even if they didnt use the wonderful old train station designed by gustave eifel or show the citys famous thermal baths
6,i was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was was the viewer supposed to learn something or reflect on anything here what was up with the pumpkins was i supposed to be impressed with the motel shots does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery the best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finishedbr br i am truly amazed i believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community
1,this is a reunion a team and a great episode of justice from hesitation to resolution clark has made a important leap from a troubled teenager who was afraid of a controlled destiny to a superman who like green arrow sets aside his emotions to his few loved ones ready to save the whole planet this is not just a thrilling story about teamwork loyalty and friendship this is also about deciding whats more important in life a lesson for clark i do not want the series to end but i hope the ensuing episodes will strictly stick to what justice shows without any rewind pushes and put a good end here of smallvilleand a wonderful beginning of supermanbr br in this episode however we should have seen more contrast between lex and the team nine stars should give it enough credit
5,i recently caught up with this little gem of a film on cable it took me by surprise even though i should have expected it from the team involved with this movie br br henry bromwell directed this film with a sure hand and it shows one always wonders about the secret life of hit killers one doesnt have to go too far to realize they probably are ones own neighbors or social acquaintances or even friends theyre no different from us at least on the surfacebr br in this story the grandfather is a despicable character who does not hesitate in eliminating anyone for the right price he has no scruples in teaching the ropes to his own son and even to the grandsonbr br alex is a man living in turmoil he knows what he has done in the past and suddenly is coming to realize the consequence of his actions he has to see someone to help him find peace with himself in going to dr parks he is trying to find absolution although he doesnt find it there on the contrary there is a dramatic twist when alex learns about who is supposed to kill nextbr br alex brilliantly portrayed by william h macy mesmerizes us not only is he a fantastic actor but he makes us believe he is that man one of the best things in the movie is the late john ritter he is equally convincing as dr parks the man who unravels the mysterybr br donald sutherland as the grandfather is perfect he is a natural actor in everything he does neve campbell surprised in her pivotal role of sarah she shows a capability and range that are incredible tracey ullman is martha the suffering wife and she doesnt get to do much also barbara bain in a rare appearance is the grandmother from hell david dorfman is a delight in the film he shows a maturity beyond his yearsbr br 
5,i just came back from the montreal premiere of zero dayand im surprised as hell to find a negative comment on the movie basically the blame is about coccio doing an easy and overplayed social messagewell mrimareviewer its an easy and overplayed critic of movies with a social chargebr br not that i want to expose my life here but i come from a small town with a similar school than these guys go reject  ignorance on the menu thing isi understand how can young kids can be driven to do such horror high schools have became battle fields of conformity its a real ugly sight you need to fight your way into being like the others its hard to explain bit a lot of people dosent realize that high schools are becoming cemeteries of human intelligence meanwhile parents are closing their eyes and smiling about how their life in their comfortable suburb is perfectbr br the real motive of the movie isnt about what is driving them its about this deathlike calm suburb and everybody closing their eyes and trying to create this atmosphere of a perfect town cal expressed it well its a wake up call drama is everywhere and it can take every shape in that case little dramaslike andre being called a faggot for wearing a jc penny shirt are shaping into being the worse nightmare of a whole town andre  cal took the most extreme way to express their pain the malaise of unconformity in an era where you need more than ever to be like the others to be acceptedbr br i like particularly the last scenes where some guys are burning the crosses of andre  cal like if with the pain they communicated cal  andre have communicated their blind rage to their community their refusal to think about the causes of some acts br br it might seemed aggressive as a movie but coccio is meditating more than whining or enunciating what andre  cal are living is a realityand a scary one that might get to other kids br br disturbing moviehome making and strong feeling made ben coccio do a very very disturbing movie
0,ridiculous horror film about a wealthy man john carradine dying and leaving everything to his four children and his servants to be divided up equally one conditionthey must spend one week in his estate to get the money and if any of them die the others get more guess what happens next br br i saw a brand new print of this film on cable the colors were bright and vivid and the house itself looks beautiful thats about all the good things i can say about itbr br lets list just some of the problems this film has the killer is screamingly obvious the servants are called igor and elgacome on some of the sound recording was so bad i couldnt make out the dialogue no great loss im sure the gore was sparse and very poorly done the other murders were simply boring stupid or impossible and this movie contains some truly abominable actingso bad you just stare at the screen in disbelief even pro jeff morrow was terrible the only fairly good acting was from trouper faith domergue who deserved better than this and john carradine who looks painfully old and frail here i do have to admit thoughthe closing line in this movie is a gembr br why this was renamed legacy of blood is beyond metheres another 1978 horror film with that namebr br whatever its name is its a bad movie to be avoided at all costs
0,i suppose if you like endless dialogue that doesnt forward the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show _angel_ youll enjoy the film me all i wanted was a nice tight little story and it wasnt there the pacing was practically backward plot points were buried under a sea of unneeded dialogue and there was absolutely no sense of dread or tension or anythingbr br is it the redneck is it the wendigo no its a cameraman on speed thats not scary it doesnt generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless youre scared by mtv like those reviewers before me i too noticed that by the end the movie invokes derisive laughter from the audiencebr br terrible film
0,hm while an enjoyable movie to poke plot holes point out atrocious acting primitive at best special effects all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years severed ranks among the worst ive ever seen im never sure who the protagonists are all i know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine as seen in the dance floor murder scene all in all i dont really like the movie because only the first 30 minutes are enjoyable the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialog and imagery that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion which i cant remember anyway
2,this is a slow moving story no action no crazy suspense no abrupt surprises if you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about loveydovey romance dont waste your time and money br br on the other hand if youre into dialog masterful story telling thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie i recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert though because the pace the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolgathering mood its truly fantastic i really mean thatbr br ethan hawke and julie delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but thankfully the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural warm and tender they act and feel each other out from the very beginning making you feel as an intruderbr br in their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner i thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but i may be underestimating their intelligence still it did not ruin the moviebr br the overall story is very simple which i think gives the movie its charm and ultimately its powerbr br bottom line the movies flow is slow the dialog is fascinating the story builds gently systematically and substantive the build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding
7,this film is pretty awful the only thing stopping me from giving it a rating of was the fact that i unfortunately have seen worsebr br the jungle music juttering demons and fluorescent uv style bloodteetheyes give it that awful look and the script is direthis film is more like a test to see how long you can last before giving up on it its also predictable but not in a good way nothing this film does is in a good way i watched it 10 minutes ago and thought i would rant a bit so there you are oh and the acting doesnt let the film down its also terrible
0,viggo mortensen stars as a new inmate of a haunted prison in which the warden played well by lane smith has a grisly secret that could be the reason why various prison guards and inmates are being slaughtered by a supernatural presence lincoln kilpatrick is the lifer who knows the secret and is scared for his life when i think prison movies i always think action movies starring stallone or van damme or high caliber dramas such as shawshank redemption or the green mile however i didnt expect a ghost story more along the lines of exorcist iii prison however is an atmospheric effort and it certainly remains the best movie of renny harlins career the movie is creepy and has some good acting from a cast of at the time unknowns lane smith comes off the best because his warden isnt the usual clich of evil personified but rather nervous and twitchy which adds some credibility to a movie that far exceeds expectationsbr br  out of 4good

4,i discovered this movie with a retailer selling oops and this one surely is an oop one year after the exorcist shes back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of blair never broke out she never became a mega star thats one of the reasons many of her films are oop she gives a good performance in this movie its about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesnt have any friends played at an age of 15 playing a girl of 14 thats funny the movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity in most editions its cut out why i dont know no blood is involved okay blair is butt naked but nothing is shown no ta so nothing to offend people but the movie is slow extremely slow it doesnt happy normally to me but i almost felt asleep its just about that 14 year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows no gore no nothing why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder to me if youre a fan of blair buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is
4,saw this film ran in the wee hours on tcm several problems with the film were apparent from what i saw first the adults did not age when the children did for 10 years several parts of the film had continuity problems  for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the 10 years passed br br the copy i saw was missing about 20 minutes or so at least a huge gap with black screen appeared it is too bad because even though the script left something to be desired bergman  russell both did fine in the film in their roles it is a shame the large chunk is missing but what is here is watchablebr br i just wish it was all intact the script makes little sense in that bergmans character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults some of the time lines dont make sense either there is a stock market crash that resembles 1929 but the kids grow up to fight in world war all the acting by the support folks in this film is fine just wonder what was in the 20 gap of film i could not see as it was missing
7,i watched this video at a friends house im glad i did not waste money buying this one the video cover has a scene from the 1975 movie capricorn one the movie starts out with several clips of rocket blowups most not related to manned flight sibrels smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast he edits in his own voiceover instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say the video curiously ends with a showing of the zapruder film his claims about radiation shielding star photography and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to grind against nasa the astronauts or american in general his science is bad and so is this video
2,after some of the negative reviews i heard on this movie i was doubtful of giving it a go but i had 399 in my wallet  thought id gamble on buying a budget like movie  saw this and gave it ago  im glad i did i enjoyed it directed by the star of films such as chain reaction the ring bourne identitybrian cox i had to gamble with this even if it was rubbish but it werent at all i found some of the humour quite funny especially alfred molina the star of spiderman the character doc ock he was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw matthews name and that made me get it and no his part isnt big at all its very short at the very end of the film its not a big part which makes me believe thats why people hate the film i suggest you give it a go some parts are a pit poor that needed polishing the acting and a bit more action but its watchable
4,glacier fox is one of the most heartrending and wonderfully photographed wildlife films ever madebr br the film makes you care about each member of this fox family from the blind cub to the strongest  their adventures are at times hilarious and also tragic set against an inhospitable countryside the audiences hearts warm to the family membersbr br the music score and lyrics tell the story intercut with narration about what is happening in general termsbr br man remains one of the biggest predators but we are left in no doubt that the foxes are capable of living not just surviving beyond human endeavours
0,i have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie i guess i must have missed something the beginning is intriguing the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories thats the best part after the three go their separate ways the film splits into three threads thats when boredom sets in certainly the thread with the felliniesque babushkas who make dolls out of chewed bread is at first an eye opening curiosity unfortunately the director beat this one to death even injecting a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular bottom line a twohour plotthin listlessness if you suffer from insomnia view it in bed and you will have a good night sleep
6,twisted desire 1996 was a tv movie starring melissa joan hart melissas character jennifer stanton a seventeenyearold seduces her current boyfriend nick ryan into murdering her two parents the movie is based on the 1990 murders of the parents of 14 year old jessica wiseman jessica had her 17 year old boyfriend douglas christopher thomas shoot and kill her parents thomas was executed in 2000 jessica was released from prison when she turned 21 years old evidence now suggests that it was jessica who fired the fatal shot that killed her mother jessica is known to now be residing somewhere in the state of virginia
1,i have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm happy feeling i felt as if i had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time i thoroughly enjoyed this film the acting was superb although i would have to mention bill nye in particular as giving an absolutely faultless performance bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films timothy spall and jimmy nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they give such a solid performance and billy connolly as always totally gorgeous it was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned such a refreshing experience to see a wellwritten superbly acted and goodlooking movie
5,this would have been what you gotbr br words alone cannot describe how bad this is if youre having trouble sleeping pop this in and i guarantee youll be out in fifteen minutesbr br robert lowery was a pretty good actor in the 40s but hes phoning it in here in an interview johnny duncan robin said that in one scene he and batman had to run from the car to the house and that lowery was doubled over out of camera range because his girdle was too tight duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle hood than a boy wonder in fact hes more like a guy in his thirties waiting for lowery to kick off so he can wear the big capebr br driving a batmobile that looks like it rolled off honest als used car lot at below sticker price the dynamic duo dont put a lot of effort into hiding the fact that its bruce waynes car theyre driving in fact its noted by several characters throughout the serialbr br the acting is wooden the sets are cheap the dialogue is horrendous and if there was even a script they were following im sure it read along the lines of batman says something here because it certainly seems like theyre making it up as it goes alongbr br batmans utility belt is made out of thin fabric with no apparent pouches to hold his gadgets in one scene when batman needs a full size blow torch the producers just tuck one in as the scene starts never to be seen again his cowl is so bad he cant even see out of it and his ears look more like flopsy mopsy the disgruntled easter rabbit than they do anything batlikebr br in one scene i am not making this up batman substitutes counterfiet radioactive money that will burst into flames the second it is exposed to air as a payoff to some hoods its radioactive so he can trace it the reason its so highly flammable isnt explained well unfortunately the thugs open the package in a cardboard warehouse we know its a cardboard warehouse because batman sneaks in and pushes these boxes that look to weigh about six ounces on the hoods to knock them out and soon the whole place burns to the ground thanks batmanbr br in another scene after the batmobile is disabled batman flags down a passing motorist in the middle of nowhere and takes his car leaving the man to fend for himself and telling him not to worry because if batman smashes up the car the police will surely buy him another one yes you guessed it said car careens off a cliff within a few short seconds not that it matters much to the motorist who has probably died from exposure trying to hoof his way back to gotham citybr br there is a tired subplot with lois lane clone vicki vale who is convinced bruce wayne is batman she must have noticed the batmobile parked outside of bruces house or maybe she saw batman and robin running up the walk in the clearly densely populated suburban neighborhoodbr br everything about this serial is bad and all but the youngest in the audience will want to hurl toast at the screen if youre looking for bad cinema you could not hit a better mark if you want entertainment try the burton batman films the adam west batman tv series or the earlier lewis wilson batman serial
0,i was initially dubious about this movie merely because of the subject but the richly drawn characters the fabulous scenes of the buffalo hunt and the dramatic conclusion make it wellworth watching i initially had trouble distinguishing between the two buffalo hunters but as the movie progressed they increasingly distinguished themselves i am still haunted by the final scene
2,neatly sandwiched between the stranger a small film noir picture that proved welles can do a formidable genre work on budget and on time and ironically proved his biggest box office success in the forties and macbeth a nobudget shakespeare adaptation shot in old western shets in 23 days comes the lady from shangai a dark film noir woven from the very same fabric of wellesian mythos that covers the magnificent ambersons mr arkadin and any other film the director didnt manage to save from the clutches of studio bossesbr br six years after the maltese falcon with the postwar craze of the film noir in full swing welles always ahead of his time a true visionary director of tremendous artistic integrity envisioned a labyrinthine world of shadows that is already darker more sinister paranoid and serpentine than anything his contemporaries were doing at the time its no wonder the movie was so misunderstood at its time to the point that one full hour of footage was forever left in the cutting room floor and it was once again europe that championed it as another welles classicbr br certain setpieces stand out the aquarium scene with its flickering light and ominous shadows and of course the funhousehall of mirrors finale that is as classic a piece of wellesian bravura as any in citizen kane or the trial the only faults i find with the movie is welles illadvised irish accent and perhaps some of the erratic editing in the first act the story however unfurls in a progressively mesmerizing manner which the cuts only serve to intensify i believe the heavily chopped versions of shangai and ambersons attain a surreal quality for that matterbr br welles would exile himself in europe for ten years and return in 1958 to deliver yet another stonewall classic the monumental touch of evil perhaps the crowning jewel of the film noir that was already in its waning days by that time shangai was not the box office success a star vehicle for hollywoods premiere star of the time rita hayworth ought to have been and welles marriage with hayworth ended before the movie was even released sixty years later and one hour of footage less shangai is still one of the best film noir pictures one is likely to discover surely that must count for something
1,warning spoilers following superb recreation of the base in antarctica where the real events of the film took place other than that libelous scandalous filmed in canada presumably by a largely canadian crew and cast i caught the last half of this film recently on global television here in canada nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled i was at what a blatant piece of american historical revisionist propaganda it is and starring susan sarandon of all people i can only assume that canadian born director roger spottiswoode was coerced to make the usaf the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in calgary kenn borek air
0,i really enjoyed this one and although the ending made me angry i still give it 10 out of 10br br four college girls baltron kelly stahl and cadby are driving down to florida on their way they meet guys turner davis they really add nothing to the plot but are at least somewhat likable the girls agree to meet the guys in florida for some fun but they have car problems and never make it one of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station for help the other three stay by the carbr br soon one of the girls has to use the bathroom being in the middle of nowhere she has no choice but to go in the bushes soon she witnesses as a man march strangles a woman in terror the girl flees the area she doesnt get very far but manages to get lostbr br her friends by the car go looking for her they too go into the woods and run into the same man one of them sees the dead woman the man responds by shooting the girls head off the other girl runs away manages to make it back to the car where she is also killedbr br eventually the two remaining girls find each other and because they break into the gas station get arrested this is when i started getting mad these poor girls are afraid for their lives and the redneck cops dont believe thembr br they are treated badly and one of them is left alone for the madman to kill her in the cell the remaining friend manages to escape but not without getting in dangerous situationsbr br this movie has nudity good actresses a shower scene imitating psycho graphic violence towards women and solid story some women will probably find it offensive and sensitive individuals will not like the ending but over all this is a great little unknown movie
5,this show has come so far at first everyone in the cast from eric to fez they were all new actors and actresses fresh faces and just look what they accomplished they stuck with the show and it was a success its one of the best shows ever made and its probably the funniest sitcom ive ever seen in my life it will be sad to see it end but if they end this show i hope to god that the series finale goes out with one of the biggest bangs that any season finale has ever had i dont care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode go down swinging get one last punch in the show deserves it the fans deserve it if they go let everyone know its going to end like on friends and let the finale be huge i say get donna and eric married i say have hyde and kelso fight and become friends again i say have something interesting happen between fez and jackie because fez has been trying for so long but of course it wont work out for him just close out the series big time guysbr br that 70s show will always be the best in my eyes eric kelso donna jackie fez hyde i wish i had you guys as friends you are the bestbr br 1010
6,the plot for descent if it actually can be called a plot has two noteworthy events one near the beginning  one at the end together these events make up maybe of the total movie time everything and i mean _everything_ in between is basically the directors desperate effort to fill in the minutes i like disturbing movies i like dark movies and i dont get troubled by gritty scenes  but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of hazydark literally scenes with no storyline you have another thing coming rosario dawson one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here and no she doesnt get naked not even in the nc17 version which i sawbr br if you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch descent take a nap instead  youll probably have more interesting dreams
7,leonard maltin mustve been watching some other movie though i find his guide to be quite a valuable resource please disregard his comments on this one he states starts off well then fizzles when its really the reverse  starts off tepid then catches fire the plot is about as simple as it gets happy mom happy dad and happy son take a vacation at an isolated beach dad incapacitated in accident mom runs off to get help meets up with dangerous escaped convict mom tries to trick convict into helping while dad waits and hangs on for dear lifebr br good whiteknuckler given an electric jolt by ralph meeker appearing suddenly the director john sturges films it in a clever way that will make you gasp around halfway through as the cunning desperate criminal meeker is an unusually flippant reckless actor at least here and in the classic kiss me deadly and he happily snatches the keys to the films narrative and speeds off with the top down his character has a habit of grinning childishly and saying pretty neat huh when hes especially pleased with his misdeeds there is a funny break in the action when they get a flat tire and he tersely instructs his hostage barbara stanwyck dont go away she fires back where would i go theyre in the middle of nowhere and he realizes sitcomishly yeah thats right the friction between them is a hootbr br there are flaws somewhat ridiculous ones theres one scene where the police who have been chasing after meeker for some time stop stanwycks car and to evade detection meeker rests his head on her shoulder like a loving husband supposedly would and pretends to be asleep as shes being questioned a he looks conspicuously unmasculine in this pose and b i think its safe to say that any adult who appears to be asleep during an encounter with law enforcement would certainly arouse suspicionbr br still a sturdy thriller which builds to an exciting and edifying conclusionbr br 
5,i dont hand out ten star ratings easily a movie really has to impress me and the bourne ultimatum has gone far beyond that furthermore this trilogy has come together so nicely that i believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time though all three films could not be any more different from the ludlum novels they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement the bourne ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete yet i could not even attempt to stop smiling for hoursbr br from the moment that the opening title appeared i knew we were in for a ride paul greengrass has done it again everything we love from the previous bourne films is here once again the action the dialogue and of course the shaky camera however for me that last one was never a problem i think it adds to the suspensebr br i will be back to see this film several times before it is released on dvd simply because it is genius it is a perfectly satisfying conclusion and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie and altogether an unforgettable trilogy
1,as a former time okinawan karate world champion i like movies about sacrifice for sport but this movie is about so much more this movie is so good and so deep i have recently been plagued by very serious injury and pretty much a disastrous lack of passion almost lights out for me and this silly little movie touched me so deep that like out of a daze it reminded me about what life is supposed to be about this is a movie about living living your life for yourself and respect for others empowerment god bless bend it like beckham i believe it is a true gem
1,allen and julie move into a cabin in the mountains after their daughter is murdered one night no one knows who killed the little girl but its why they moved to the mountains so the couple moves into this cabin and its haunted by people who killed themselves there and no one in the nearby town wants to talk about itbr br this movie has a lot of creepiness to it and it has a lot of parts that made me jump some of the parts are predictable but once in a while there is a part i didnt expect it was a pretty good movie that wasnt the scariest movie in the world but it was still scary enough to make it pretty goodbr br i also liked the ending because it left the viewer to decide how it ends it is also kind of a sad movie as well but a well done horror movie
3,cannot believe a movie that can be made that good in 1987 and is virtually unknown in the west not to repeat other reviews here the score is very good and moving literally it means dawn please never comes  when it comes the beautiful ghost and the lover will be apart forever after 24 years joel and leslie still look great i enjoyed joel in god of gamblers and many movies by leslie including better tomorrow
0,probably bigas lunas finest achievement for it achieves a delicate balance between sleaze eroticism and surrealism the delicious mathilda may who spent most of tobe hoopers lifeforce in the buff is the object of young biel durans preteen lust he cant get mays breasts out of his mind and wants so badly to suckle them and suckle the breasts of his own mother too his pursuit of may is the film as in luna works such as lulu and jamon jamon the director brings a slightly warped sexual sensibility to his strange but beautiful tale the usual suspects will be offended but those with open minds will enjoy this frothy erotic poem to the female breast jos luis alcaines images are gorgeous and nicola piovanis score is sweet and rich a gorgeous cinematic confection with a delightfully anarchic sensibility that the spanish do so naturally
4,spoiler the young lover jed is kicked out by the spinster kate andie mcdowell because she wrongly believes that jed is having an affair with one of her two catty girlfriends kate thought she caught them en flagrante delicto kate throws jeds shoes out the door jed reluctantly leaves and then sits in the middle of the road to put his shoes on then he gets run over crushed one of the meaning of the title by a truck and diesbr br and then he gets run over by a truck can you imagine a screenwriter actually submitting a script with this plot element up to then its a comedy that intends to be frothy but lacks any real fizz everybody but jed is just annoying and then they kill jed and everybodys sad until the end where the gals learn to love one another and be supportive instead of destructive i give it ughs
5,is being pretty generous here i really enjoyed boogeyman even though it is not really the boogeyman promoted on the dvd cover and we all know it it creeped me out but this film it is something else for being directed by a guy who has been around a long time and directed a lot of movies it looks like it was shot on a vhs camcorder by a 10 year old the story and acting are atrocious david hess you have let me down too after playing one of the most menacing villains in film history you have resorted to this the story and acting may have been able to be forgiven however if anyone had taken the time to make the video look somewhat professional there are a lot of shot on video films out there that dont look like it or at least arent so obvious that it detracts your attention from the film i cant say it is the worst movie ever because i couldnt make it through the entire film but it is certainly close
2,i like british humor i believe its one of the best in the world i like almost every british sitcom okay maybe not monthy python some of the jokes were great but some of them i didnt understand but this league of gentlemen is just something good to make you sick this show was good in some way it helped me lost some weight because watching this piece of garbage make me feel im not hungry anymore this is really just disgusting sick and not even funny tv show and i wonder who is actually laughing at this stuff i watched it for about 10 minutes and turned it off it was so disgusting watching men dressed in the woman with yellow teeth and urinating on the car i mean whats so funny about that it makes me wanna puke no humor just disturbing images and cheap toilet laughs i dont know if you like this stuff you go ahead watch it but to be honest people watching and enjoying this must have some emotional problems garbage
7,the comic banter between william powell and jean arthur is the highlight of this murder mystery which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely plots ever powell is probably the most suave detective of the 30s and arthur has a unique voice which often sounds like a succession of tiny tinkly bells they are extremely fun to watch so take the brashness of the plot with a grain of salt and just enjoy seeing it unfold eric blore also has some comic turns as powells butlerbr br powells contract with mgm included a clause which allowed him to reject being loaned out to another studio but he wanted to work again with arthur and he liked the script so he eagerly accepted the assignment they had worked together in two 1929 paramount films the canary murder case and the greene murder case both in the philo vance series
0,thank god i didnt waste my money renting it but i downloaded it this happens to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life fg visual effects unnecessary gore and nudity far apart from other zombie movies like night of the living dead and others there are lots of loop holes and mistakes in the movie ok if you get time after reading this comment please check out the directorsulli lommel profile after seeing that i got a self explanation why the movie is like this i mean every movie directed by ulli lommel gets a rating between and and now am not willing to search what kinda movies these are directed by him but i can finish all this by saying one strong sentence even for fun or time pass or even at an extreme bored situation please do not watch this movie
7,he now has a name an identity some memories and a a lost girlfriend all he wanted was to disappear but still they traced him and destroyed the world he hardly built now he wants some explanation and to get ride of the people how made him what he is yeah jason bourne is back and this time he s here with a vengeancebr br ok this movie doesnt have the most elaborated script in the world but its thematics are very clever and ask some serious questions about our society of course like every hollywoodian movie since the end of the 90s the bourne suprematy is a superheroes story jason bourne is a captainamerica projectlike whos gone completely wrong in the first movie the hero discovered his abilities and he accepted them in the second one he now fights against what he considers like evil after a person close to him has been killed his girlfriend in suprematy by them thats all a part of the superhero story including a character with realistic but still impressive  he almost invincible super powersbr br and the interesting point is that the evil he fights all across the world theres no frontiers in the bournes movies characters are going from one continent to another in the blink of an eye is as in the best seasons of 24 an american enemy whos beliefs that he fight for the good of his country completely blinds him funny how mad patriots are now the n1 enemies of paranoiac hollywoods storiesbr br beside all those interesting thematics the movie isnt flawless  the feminine character of nickie parson is for now on completely useless and the direction is quite unoriginal when it comes to dialogs scenes but all that doesnt really matter for the bourne ultimatum is an action movie and the action scenes are rather impressivebr br everyone here is talking about the waterloo scene and the tanger pursuit and everyones right i particularly enjoyed the fight in tanger that reminds my in its exaggeration and craziness the works of tsui hark visually inventive scenes lots of intelligent action parts and a good reflection on americans contemporary thematics  the bourne ultimatum is definitely the best movie of the series and a very interesting and original action flick
7,there are some excellent comments and observations on this film i was pleased to note the comparisons to fritz langs m forget the 50s abortive remake with lightweight david wayne the real villain is not the tortured murderer extraordinarily fine performance by jeffery demunn taking out his sexually frustrated anger on his victims mostly children he is the objective the real villain is the stifling bureaucratic soviet system drowning in its own corrupted incompetence the frustration of an uncompromisingly dedicated man rea in his best role since the crying game a facile pragmatist whos willing to use the system to his advantage sutherland always successful in this kind of role a hesitant frightened but determined psychiatrist the incomparable max sydow the bumbling boopous bureaucrat of a prosecutor brilliant brit actor john wood and the quiet supporting wife of the driven investigator delightful supporter imelda staunton this is one damn fine film its darkness and bleakness are supported by the portrayal of a corrupt incompetent system which works against success the is no need to dip into goreladen slice n dice sensationalism that has characterized so many recent films gore is present its a ghastly story but it adds to the depicting of a pathologically twisted human being the success of the story is precisely that these were acts perpetrated by a person a human like you or i where you and i choose to vent our frustration by reasonable means chikatilo took his anger out on the most innocent and vulnerable of us our children the superb premise of this story is made manifest by an equally superb cast of excellent actors sadly i note that our australian friend didnt like the speech and no doubt would have preferred to hear them speaking in aussie dialect well too bad this fine film sure worked for me and everyone else ive talked with who has seen it
0,i do not envy barry levinson rachel weisz ben stiller or jack black for doing this film its in one word boring maybe the fact that is too predictable the morethanexploited ben stillers loser role or the notatall funny scenes make this film just something to forget even christopher walkens appearance finishes in a pathetic way i was very disappointed i love ben stillers acting i loved it in most of his films the last one i saw before this was duplex with drew barrymore and was not that bad about jack black well apart from high fidelity ive never seen him doing something good what about school of rock ooops frightening
5,say what you want about andy milligan  but if his family was even 10 as deranged as the one in this film well then i guess he could have turned out worse unfortunately the video print of this film contains sex scene inserts originally shot by the distributor to boost the pictures box office appeal several times during the film milligans ugly camerawork and silent film music abruptly ends and suddenly goodlooking standins for milligans homely actors take over and start doing it to psychedelic 60s guitar rock its pretty easy to fastforward through if youre trying to pay attention to milligans original film which unfortunately is missing quite a bit of action that was cut to make room for the added sex scenes what remains however is still compelling stuff i dont think ive ever seen a more hateful mother in any film before
5,i for one have shamelessly enjoyed every episode of pushing daisies this season and hope that the writers strike wont brutally end the beginnings of a very good show ned is a pie maker who owns a restaurant in the middle of town and has a secret talent emmerson is a private investigator with his own unique quirks like his love of knitting charlotte chuck is the oncedeadbutnotanymore childhood friend and sunny spot of neds life olive is the jealous but goodhearted waitress oh and add the dog jim dale brings all the characters together with his wonderful narration of the show chuck ned and emmerson along with olive and occasionally the dog solve multiple murder mysteries with the assistance of neds special gift of bringing dead people back to life the show is funny clean and romantic in a very cute and goodhearted way and id recommend it to anyone
5,whoever wrote the nice post about this must have been a friend of these guys this is bad even for backyard wrestling in fact this isnt even backyard wrestling really its a few guys hitting each other on a trampoline each guys is about 45 lbs wet and there is not one ounce of entertainment value in this it is just a few bored kids that even give yard tards a bad name if that is possible if you want to see some entertaining backyard wrestling pick up backyard wrestling a pleasure for pain it stars the biggest names in byw mdogg20 and josh prohibition these guys are good they have actually went since yarding it and gotten professionally trained as real pro wrestlers they went legit and have gotten better i recommend checking out those guys mdogg is insane and off the hook so dont waste your time or your cash on this crappy dvd there are better back yard videos out there
5,this is the definitive movie version of hamlet branagh cuts nothing but there are no wasted moments
2,i checked this out as an impulse when browsing through the movie store and couldnt have been any more pleasantly surprised my mom and i watched this film together and we thoroughly enjoyed it it isnt the typical chickflick with a sappy love story and tears all the way through but it definitely touches a nerve in the twist at the end its an ending where although unexpected and tragic the movies overall effect is not harmed by it i think reese witherspoon was a great actress even in this film her debut and this is definitely worth watching i didnt recognize many of the supporting actors but they all play their important supporting roles well the man in the moon is such an believable story about a young teenager falling in love for the first time most women can definitely relate to everythingfrom witherspoons words her subtle glances and her not so subtle emotions raging like the typical teenage girl while shes playing a character confused about love she does not come across as silly and immature which was much appreciated considering many movies today
5,this is the first 10 out of 10 that ive given any movie what made this movie so good for me constant action  there isnt any slow parts great acting smart writing i also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene finally i get to see an action movie that doesnt try to please all sectors of the public ie theres no forced romancebr br i liked the first two bourne movies but i loved this onebr br warning  after watching this movie you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car
1,over the years weve seen a lot of preposterous things done by writers when the show just had to go on no matter what keeping simple rules going after john ritter died comes to mind but this is probably the first time i cared the idea of having that 70s show without eric or to a lesser extent kelso is ridiculous they tried to cover it up with a comeback of leo and increasingly outrageous story lines but it always felt like why bother when you dont have a main character anymore it just didnt really connect it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time wasnt even funny the last season felt like the season too much for every single character simply because eric used to take a lot of screen time and now wed be smashed in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were focusing on the gimmick that is fez was thoroughly uninteresting and the character would simply stop working because the whole deal was that hed say something weird from out of nowhere and you cant say stuff from out of nowhere when every second line is yours they also brought in the standard cousin oliver only this time it just wasnt a kid whenever you heard somebody knock on the door you started praying it wasnt randy please let it not be randy the deal with randy was that hed do really awful jokes usually as red would say smiling like an ass and totally screwing up delivery and donna would be in stitches i think more than half of the last season was donna pretending to be amused the problems had started earlier though what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept that for once wasnt about a dysfunctional family slowly got into the territory of soap opera everybody started being in love with everybody emotional scenes were dragged out at nausea with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to divert attention that we were watching as the world turns im guessing this was character development but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from family matters to be fair the last episode also because it had a cameo by topher grace a cameo in his own show was really good even if not that funny eitherbr br by the way yet more criticism on season what the hell was with the opening theme not only did they use the same joke twice a character not singing fez scared the hell out of me dude dont open your eyes that far but the first five seasons or soamong the best comedy ever broadcast
4,i really do not know what people have against this film but its definitely one of my favourites its not preachy its not anchored by its moral it shouldnt be controversial its just god any possible god no matter the religion and its really funnybr br jim carry plays bruce nolan a tv reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news desperate to prove himself more or less to himself that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job this drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend grace jennifer aniston away when the final straws are executed hes quick to not laugh but yell in the face of god who in turn gives bruce his powers bruce then makes his life better for himself until hes guilted into helping others where he then continues to miss the point of his powers meanwhile his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish leaving his relationship on dangerous groundbr br ok that was kinda long but as a plot it works well the stepbystep fashion in which we meet the challenges of being god is much better than clustering his problems together and is able to hide itself fairly wellbr br as you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place carreys pitchperfect acting stays in character which luckily enough is him and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene whether they would admit it or not the role was written or rewritten exclusively for carrey without him the humour would turn flat as humour is half execution and the humour is very good in the first place but without carrey it would kinda feel like a its a wonderful life wannabebr br jennifer aniston is great and no matter what some may say does not act like the only excuse for the third act at least you dont think that when you see her she gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget youre watching a movie she and carrey feel very much like a real couplebr br the movie feels ggooooodd see the movie to understand has a very nice feeling tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save carreys career which wasnt goin anywhere
7,i think dark angel is great first season was excellent and had a good plot with maxjessica alba as an escaped x5 manticore creation trying to adapt to a normal life but still saving the world and being hunted by manticore throughout the season which gives the series some extra spicebr br the second season though suddenly became a bit odd compared to the first the plot kinda disappeared and the series lost a little of its charm mostly because of all the weird creatures appearing dont get me wrong the second season is good but with a little bit to much of the manticores however they managed to get back to a new promising plot in the closing episodes of season in which i had a lot of hopes to see more ofbr br so i really wish they could start making new episodes and with james cameron behind this it cant go wrong so as a conclusion i would say its a great series however im still hoping for a third season
0,breaking glass is a film that everyone aspiring to be in the music industry should see more than once it is a very dark tale about the way a record company manipulates a singer to do things their way and to make as much money out of her as possible looking at some of todays search for a star style tv shows on both in the uk and abroad i am always reminded of this film though not an expert on the subject the winners of these shows tend to have one very big initial hit and then its downhill from there this film predates these shows though the effect seems the same after getting rid of her manager played quite brilliantly by phil daniels slowly but surely the record company changes her lyrics puts her on stimulants and she is eventually totally burnt out you potential stars of tomorrow watch this and beware 
2,elvis has left the building and hes lucky because he didnt have to watch this unfunny stinker scene after scene director joel zwick finds ways to make an unfunny script even less amusing filled with unfunny deaths trite gay characteratures and hack jokes this film is more desperate than amusing this is the sort of film that makes one hope kim basinger follows doris day into premature retirement let us remember her the way she was talented and not what shes become david leisure the delicious dennis richards and the rest are all wasted talents here zwick finds a way to minimize their talents at every turn the guy playing elvis sounds more like gomer than the kingthe only really good bit of casting is the young girl who plays basinger as a preteen she really looks like her and is actually pretty good the only other reason to watch this film at all is to look for the tom hanks cameo the cameo isnt all that funny but at least its not painful one has to wonder if zwick has incriminating pictures of hanks or something that would make him do this movie
6,skippy from family ties plays eddie a wussy metal nerd who gets picked on when his favorite wussy metal singer sammi curr dies he throws a hissy fit tearing down all the posters on his bedroom wall but when he later gets an unreleased record that holds the spirit of his dead metal idol he first gets sucked into ideas of revenge but then he doesnt want to take it as far as sammi does which isnt really that far as his main victims only seem to go to the hospital this movie is utterly laughable and has about as much to do with real metal as say rock star ok maybe a tad more than that piece of junk but you get my point and how anyone can root for a guy played by skippy from family ties i havent a clue the cameo by gene simmons is ok and ozzy osbourne reaches coherency i applaud him for that but otherwise skip this onebr br my grade d br br eye candyelise richards gets topless an a topless extra at a pool party
2,cinderella in my opinion greatest love story ever told i loved it as a kid and i love it now a wonderful disney masterpiece this is of my favorite movies i love disney i could rave on and on about cinderella and disney all day but i wont i ll give you a brief outline of the story when a young girls father dies she has to live with her evil step mother and her equally ugly and nasty step sisters drusilla and anastasia made to do remedial house chores all day poor cinderella has only the little mice who scurry around the house and her dog bruno as friends when one day a letter is sent to her house telling all available women to attend a royal ball cinderellas evil step mother and step sisters try to prevent her attendance cinderella finally gets her dream and wish and is able to attend her captive beauty  genorisity and beautiful nature help her win her prince
0,for shame for shame that a fine actor such as joseph fiennes would allow himself to be cast in this piece of nauseating drivel the movie was not only bad but down right horrible and of no redeeming quality the plot was there one seemed to go no where the russians played silly kill or be killed games and the rest of the cast should be declared null and void for their pathetic performances i gave up about 34 of the way through and turned it off a for awful only because there is nothing lower dont waste your time on this one youll not miss anything
6,well i hate hollywood but love cinema so i have to watch these cruddy movies in theaters and i was hoping vanilla sky would be good i was hoping that they would either keep the original open your eyes exactly the same or they would make it their own well it happened to be a little bit of both and it suckedbr br it started out good i love radiohead i wish there was more of that but by the end we are listening to good vibrations by the beach boys talk about a wide range of suck between they had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a couple others but why oh why did they have to blare gv during the climax it was more annoying than confusing or blatant especially when it has nothing to do with the plot at least put some meaning behind the songs kid a  primary whateverbr br he also did a bang up job with the club scene that was cool otherwise the movie was one big ball of arrogance as if audiences would get the movie the ones that would get it read subtitles and the rest wont its as simple as that the motivations got all screwed up i didnt comprehend the diaz motivations hadnt they done the chicken soup night before and some of the others and i hate kurt russell stay overboard tom cruise cant act especially in these types of movie ie eyes wide shut and the elevator i get it anyways they tried improving the original with a crappy american rock soundtrack and crappy angles and good film print and glossy processing and it would have helped if crowe hadnt screwed it upbr br 210 major disappointment
6,although i love this movie i can barely watch it it is so real so i put it on tonight and hid behind my bank of computers i remembered it vividly but just wanted to see if i could find something i hadnt seen beforei didnt thats because its so real to mebr br another user wrote the ages of the commentators should be shown with their summary im all for that  its absolutely obvious that most of these people whove made comments about midnight cowboy may not have been born when it was released they are mentioning other movies jon voight and dustin hoffman have appeared in at a later time ill be just as ruinously frank i am 82yearsold if youre familiar with some of my other comments youll be aware that i was a professional femaleimpersonator for 60 of those years and also have appeared in film  youd never recognize me even if you were familiar with my nightclub persona do you think i know a lot about the characters in this film  you bet i do br br and am not the least bit ashamed if you havent runinto some of them its your loss  but theres a huge chance you have but just didnt know it so many moms dads sons and daughters could surprise you it should be no secret many actorsactresses have emerged from the backgrounds of midnight cowboy who is to judge  i can name several current bigtime stars who were raised on the seedy streets of many cities and werent the least bit damaged by their time spent there i make no judgment because these are humans just as we all are  love courage kindness compassion intelligence humility you name the attributes they are all there no matter what the package looks likebr br the trivia about hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of ratzo is a gem  he can be seen driving his auto all around los angeles  how do you think he gets his input i can also name lots of malestars who have stood on the streets and cruised the bars for money although the nightclub i last worked in for 26 years was worldfamous and legit i can also name some huge stars that had to be constantly chased out our backstreet looking to make a pickupbr br this should be no surprise today although its definitely action in hollywood and other cities large and small wakeup and smell the roses they smell no less sweet because they are of a different huebr br some of the users thought joe buck had been molested by his grandma although i saw him in her bed with a boyfriend i didnt find any incidence of that believeitornot kids havent always had their own rooms  because that is a must today should tell you something kinda kinky may be goingon in the masterbedroom whose business hoffman may have begged for change on the streets but some of the users pointout that jon voight was not a major star for the filming of midnight cowboy  his actual salary would surprise you i think he was robbed  no one can doubt the clarity he put into his role nor that it made him a star for such great work as deliverance he defined a potent man who had conquered his devils and was the better for it few people commented he had been sodomized in this movie the end of the 60s may have been one of the first films to be so open but society has always been hipbr br i also did not find any homosexuality between ratzo and joe  they were clearly opposites unappealing to one another they found a much purely higher relationship  true friendship if you didnt understand that at the end of the movie then youve wasted your time joes bewilderment but unashamed devotion was apparent yes voight deserved an oscar for this role  one that john wayne could never pulloff and he was as handsome in his youthbr br hoffman is hoffman  you expect fireworks he gave them superbly wayne got his oscar every character in this film was beautifully defined  if you dont think they are still around you are mistaken the party   attend some of the raves younger people attendif you can get in look at the lines of people trying to get into the hot clubs  youll see every outrageous personalitybr br brenda viccaro was the epitome of societys sleek women who have to get down to the nittygritty at times if you were shocked by her brilliant acting thinking this isnt real look at todays ladies who live on the brink of disreputeand are admired for itbr br the brutality joe displayed in robbing the old guy unfortunately is also a part of life you dont have to condone it but its not too much different than any violence joe pointedly named his purpose  in that situation id have handedover the money quicker than he asked for it thats one of the scenes that makes this movie a breakthrough one which i do not watch i get heartbroken for bothbr br john schlesinger certainly must have been familiar with this sordidness to direct this chillingly beautiful eyeopener waldo salt didnt write from clairvoyance anyone who had any part of getting it to the screen must have realized they were making history and should be proud for the honesty of it perhaps only in america can we close our eyes to unpleasant situations while other moviemakers make no compunction in presenting it to the public not looking doesnt mean it isnt there  give me the truth every time bravo to all
5,seeing this movie as i just did for the first time on turner classic which lists it as dangerous female can only multiply your appreciation for the 1941 bogartastor version ricardo cortez must have been getting paid by the smirk i hope he remembered his dentist and his brylcreem salesman in his will they made him the actor he was the women are all good but no better than that well una merkel is a little better more interesting are the original joel cairo and mr gutman who competently deliver many of the individual tics but almost nothing of the setchanging atmospherics of their successors in the roles peter lorre and sydney greenstreet humphrey bogart and mary astor somehow transcended the essential seediness of their characters in the remake here sam spade and ruth wonderley cant br br this movie doesnt exactly stink it lies there like a big slice of ham its chief value today is as a reminder that great movies like the 41 falcon dont just happen on the 1to10 scale i rate it a mainly for the camera work and the supporting players
0,the wrinkle in time book series is my favorite series from childhood i have read and reread them more times than i can count over the last 35 years the characters with all their virtues and flaws are near and dear to my heart this adaptation contained very little of the wonderful magical spiritual story that i love so much to say i was disappointed with this film would be a great understatementbr br if you have never read the books i imagine you will enjoy the movie the acting is passable the special effects are well done for a made for tv movie and the story is interesting however if you love the books avoid this movie at all costsbr br i found this statement at the wikipedia page of the novel in an interview with newsweek lengle said of the film i expected it to be bad and it isbr br i like another reviewer here feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind
5,this waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great film nothing new or original is added other than perrys backflashes which are of marginal interest it lacks the documentary feel of the first film and the raw urgency that made it so effective also painfully missing is the sharp quincy jones soundtrack that added to much to the original film i cant understand any high ratings for this at all its quite bad why does anyone waste time or money making crap like this and why did i waste time watching it
3,where to begin theres so much wrong and horrible about this movie i am not sure where to start okay the two stooges who wrote this crapper joseph green and rex carlton first they couldnt make up their socalled minds for a name my guess they split the difference thats why the main title is brain that wouldnt die but the end screen says head that wouldnt die neither one knows anything about the medical profession after all doctors take oaths to do no harm killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered harm plus a little thing called blood and tissue matching rejection would spell death for jan in the pan plus who keeps a patch work monster what medical school did bill graduate from frankenstien university old fu or mad scientist tech the monster had no name that bugs the hell out of me plus the brilliant surgeon doctor bill cortner doesnt know how to keep a patient sedated all and all a disaster of a movie its incredibly stupid and unwatchable except on mst3k i give it the thanksgiving turkey
7,basically this movie is one of those rare movies you either hate and think borders on suicide as the next best thing to do rather than having to sit through it for two hours or as in my case you see it as a kult hit one of those movies wherein the humour the plot the acting is actually very hidden but for those of us willing to go looking for it trusting the director well the reward is u laugh your a of  the fact that u have to find the things mentioned above actually makes the movie even more funny because u get the impression the director isnt even aware of how funny his movie is which doesnt seem likely and therein lies the intelligence at the helm of this magnificient project called  spaced invaders 
4,john schlesingers midnight cowboy is perhaps most notable for being the only xrated film in academy history to receive the oscar for best picture this was certainly how i first came to hear of it and to be completely honest i didnt really expect much of the film this is not to say that i thought it would be horrible but somehow i didnt consider it the sort of movie that i would enjoy watching this is one reason why you should never trust your own instincts on such manners  a remarkable combination of stellar acting ambitious directing and a memorable soundtrack everybodys talking at me i dont hear a word theyre sayin make this film one of the finest explorations of life naivety and friendship ever releasedbr br young joe buck thennewcomer jon voight dressed proudly as a rodeo cowboy travels from texas to new york to seek a new life as a hustler a male prostitute women however do not seem to be willing to pay money for his services and joe faces living in extreme poverty as his supply of money begins to dry up during these exploits joe comes to meet enrico ratso rizzo dustin hoffman a sickly crippled swindler who initially tries to con joe out of all his money when they come to realise that they are both in the same predicament ratso offers joe a place to stay and working together they attempt to make largely dishonest lives for themselves in the cold gritty metropolis of new yorkbr br joe had convinced himself that new york women would be more than willing to pay for sex however his first such business venture ends with him guiltily paying the woman sylvia miles twenty dollars though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent ratso is just as nave as joe ratso with his painful limp and hacking cough is always assuring himself that if only he could travel to the warmth of miami somehow everything would be all right this misguided expectation that things will get better so easily is quite reminiscent of lennie and george of john steinbecks classic novel of mice and menbr br shot largely on the streets of new york midnight cowboy is a grittilyrealistic look at life in the slums watching the film we can almost feel ourselves inside ratsos squalid unheated residence our joints stiff from the aching winter cold the acting certainly contributes to this ultrarealism with both voight and hoffman masterfully portraying the two decadent dregs of modern society hoffman in particular is exceptional in his role im walkin here im walkin here managing to steer well clear of being typecast after his muchlauded debut in 1967s the graduate both stars were later nominated for best actor oscars also nominated for acting  bafflingly  was sylvia miles for an appearance that cant have been for more than five minutes though both ultimately lost out to john wayne in true grit midnight cowboy eventually went on to win three oscars from seven nominations including best picture best director for schlesinger and best writing for waldo saltbr br midnight cowboy is told mainly in a linear fashion though there are numerous flashbacks that hint at joes past rather than explicitly explaining what these brief snippets are actually about the audience is invited to think about it for themselves and how these circumstances could have led joe onto the path he is now pursuing the achinglybeautiful final scene leaves us with a glimmer of hope but a large amount of uncertainty gritty thoughtprovoking and intensely fascinating midnight cowboy is one for the ages
1,having seen cube ive been a fan of vincenzo natalis work natali seems to have this inept ability to take a storyline and hardly wring it our like a wet towel for all the storyline he can muster instead he lets the stories themselves unfold in natural ways so much in fact that you may in fact believe there is this cube were people try to escape or in the case of nothing a large empty expanse where there is nothing the advert had me hooked instantly it seemed so simple take two characters who no one likes and send them to a world where there is nothing natali does this so simply that you forget the logic that a place where there is nothing cannot exist in fact the world of nothing becomes something of an irony within the film theres nothing there but also something therebr br it might be a good time to point out that the trailer is highly misleading i was fortunate enough to actually understand that the film leaned to a more comedic side than the trailer otherwise told so therefore upon watching the film i laughed every now and again whereas someone who the advert mislead may find themselves utterly confusedbr br if i may take a minute to give the film some praise where the film excels on is the concept it is a genius concept to have a world of nothing and to put two characters there not two brilliant minded characters who will philosophise and work out their surroundings but two idiots who have absolutely no clue as to where the hell they are another strong point is the films cinematography though at first this may not seem it where each wall north earth south west up and down is just a white plane a perception of depth becomes faulty it is hard to determine where things are placed in the misenscene the cinematography has many moments where this actually happens but for the most part the camera is placed so that two characters or an object and a character are placed in the foreground and background allowing a sense of depth to be realisedbr br however this film does lack in certain areas the film is relatively short but even so after a while the novelty of this world of nothing becomes rather dull and you wish to find some form of resolution within the plot we can also argue that the acting is once again questionable these two characters are in a sense unlikeable therefore we feel no sympathy at any point for these characters however on a flip side of that the chemistry and friendship between the two characters seems real enough but there is something lackingbr br even so i do rank this as a thoroughly enjoyable film do not let the trailer fool you into thinking this is another sciencefiction horror film it is much more of a comedy than that it is indeed worth watching though purely for the concept itself
5,johnny weissmullers final film as king of the jungle after 16 years in the role tarzan and the mermaids is bound to disappoint all but the most ardent of his fans at 44 the exolympian one of hollywoods most active party animals was long past the slim athleticism of his youth and looked tired although he was in marginally better condition than in his previous entry tarzan and the huntressbr br not only had weissmuller gotten too old for his role johnny sheffield the quintessential boy had grown to manhood he was a strapping 17year old so he was written out of the script under the pretext of being away at school brenda joyce at 35 was appearing in her fourth of five films as jane she would provide the transition when lex barker became the new tarzan in 1949s tarzans magic fountain and was still as wholesomely sexy as everbr br produced by sol lesser at rko on a minuscule budget the cast and crew took advantage of cheaper labor by filming in mexico while the location gave a decidedly hispanic air to what was supposedly darkest africa veteran director robert florey utilized the country extensively incorporating cliff diving and an aztec temple into the storybr br when a young island girl tyrone powers future bride linda christian is rescued in a jungle river by tarzan he learns that a local high priest george zucco one of filmdoms most enduring villains had virtually enslaved the local population threatening retribution from a living god if they dont do his bidding the girl had been chosen to become the gods bride so she fled faster than you can say is this a dumb plot or what the girl is kidnapped by the priests henchmen and returned to the island and tarzan followed by jane colorful spanish character benjy charmingly played by john laurenz who sings several tunes and a government commissioner are off to take on the deity and his priest poor cheeta is left behind after a series of discoveries the god is simply a con man in an aztec mask working with the priest in milking the islands rich pearl beds a bit of brawling action and comic relief and songs by benjy everything reaches the expected happy conclusionbr br remarkably tarzan and the mermaids features a musical score by the brilliant film composer dimitri tiomkin and is far better than what youd expect from this b movie br br while the film would provide a lessthanauspicious end to weissmullers time in tarzans loincloth he would immediately go on to play jungle jim a more eloquent variation of the ape man in khakis the talent involved lifted the overall product at least a little above the total mess it could have beenbr br tarzan was about to get a make over and become much sexier

0,this film was shot on location in gerard gardens in liverpool and was the uks answer to films such as blackboard jungle the film stands the test of time quite well with all the moral stories still or even more relevant today the film feature some fine performance from some notable british actors such as david mccallum stanley baker peter cushing and anne heywood baker plays a liverpool cop assigned to juvenile liaison duties with the premise that if you catch the kids at an early age they will end up being responsible adultsbr br notable cameos in the film include freddie starr fred fowell and melvyn hayes gloria tsai chin and michael chow play brother and sister they are real life brother and sister who are caught up in an arsonists web tsai chin is still acting and can be seen in the latest nicole kidman film the interpretorbr br violent playground features a gun siege in a school so is unlikely to be shown on tv following similar events in scotland  russiabr br i lived in gerard gardens where the film was shot though was not born at the time and have fond memories of the area i have recently completed a documentary on gerard gardens which includes extracts from violent playground and a small uk film coast to coast which stars lenny henry and pete postlewaite the tenements were demolished in 1987 and the films go some way in keeping the memory alivebr br there were some complaints from the residents when the film was released as the film portrayed the area in a bad light time has helped heal those woundsbr br a little gem of a film i would recommend you seek this out
1,make a you sacks of german staples well when i started to watch this sack of crud it was a sunday afternoon and i was just looking for stuff on show time i was introduced to a hot naked babe and like any guy im a guy the email is my sisters i was happy but then they threw it all to the dogs spit on it lit it on fire and peed it out you wanna know how the dumb chick talked the dialog throughout the film was just horrible sounded like something my 2nd grade bro could wright the violence was nice for some scenes but some was just totally moronic the scene in the pit were he gives the guy the knife dumb moron to sum it up this is pure cinema barf drenched in the chocolate syrup known as nudity and topped with the cherry of horrible acting as only a porn star could deliver
4,as you may have gathered from the title i wholeheartedly believe this movie to be the worst zombie movie of all time the acting camerawork writing special effects and anything else remotely related to this movie sucked people have argued that while this movie is terriblyacted and terriblyproduced but it comes through with a witty intelligent script wow the plot has more holes than i or anyone else could possibly count for starters why would the government tell everyone to go back to work when its not safe i know the governments supposed to be evil but they dont gain anything by killing the entire population of the country there wouldnt be anyone to govern another thing that i was wondering about even if the government told everyone to go to work why would people go if the streets were swarming with zombies were the zombies going to hide in the bushes and ambush the unsuspecting people in order to aid the government in their plot to kill everyone on the planet and how about the ending that stupid torch guy sacrifices his life in order to get a few close up shots of the zombies he probably forgot that every camera made in the last 35 years has a zoom feature and another thing why does he say hindenburg before he dies the hindenburg was a rare event seen by a very few people the zombie menace will been seen by everyone in the country possibly the world he doesnt think anyone else will get a few snapshots they also managed to ruin the only semiinteresting scene in the film when the soldier is watching the exotic dancer why did the zombie hide behind a curtain for five minutes before attacking the girl especially when the zombie could have come through the door its probably just something an unintelligent zombie movie fan such as myself wouldnt understand every day i pray that god with increase my brain capacity long enough for me to figure out all the subtle nuances in feeding the massesbr br anywho i think its interesting that this is the first movie that gave me the desire to physically hurt the people involved in the production hey trent haaga im calling you out
7,on the eighth day god created georges but the same as an eighth day doesnt fit into the week georges doesnt fit into the modern world he has down syndrome and is therefore marginalized by society shunted off to an asylum after his mothers death four years ago she was the only one who loved himbr br harry is another man that isnt loved anymore his wife has left him for reasons that she is unable to explain he loses the love of his daughters too when he arrives too late at the railway station to collect the two kids who wanted to spend the weekend with their fatherbr br harry is a highly ranked businessman he knows all the rules that enable us to succeed in our modern meritocracy but he has entered a state of crisis which reaches a climax after the loss of the love of his daughters he questions the sense of his life without obtaining any definite resultsbr br harry and georges meet at first harry tries to get rid of georges the same as all the others do but georges cant be shaken off and it gradually dawns on harry how much he needs georges if he wants to get over his identity crisis it is georges who opens a new access to the world for him and who makes him view his life with different eyes friendship and human warmth take the place of calculating striving for success it is no surprise that harry now cannot avoid failing in his jobbr br georges helps harry to regain the recognition of the daughters even his wife has to admit that the fireworks which he organized were worth seeing nonetheless a reintegration into the old life is no longer possible and the new one turns out to be nothing more than a dream with a time limit which unstoppably will reach its end the camera watches harry and georges from above for one long minute as they are both lying down in the grass just savoring the moment but the same as this minute will unavoidably go by the friendship of the two men which came into being in such a wondrous fashion will not be longlasting georges is destroyed by the impossibility of love to the opposite sex and can see no other way out but to commit suicide harry turns into a city tramp who asks the car drivers that are waiting in front of the traffic lights for charitybr br the movie describes modern meritocracy as a disastrous mechanism which devours positive values such as human warmheartedness or friendship it is georges the mongol who seems to be capable of showing the way out of the dilemma but unfortunately his plea comes to a bad end however his failure does not necessarily have to mean that it is impossible or not desirable to reach the aspired goal the way he shows us is surely passable although it requires a huge amount of willpower and above all the courage to apply a radical nonconformism
1,just as its a mad mad mad mad world is at the top of my list for all time greatest comedies ever made this one is at the very bottom of course i could be wrongnot having seen saving silverman in other words its a lame lame lame lame comedybr br rating 12 out of 
1,what a terrible movie the acting was bad the pacing was bad the cinematography was bad the directing was bad the special effects were bad you expect a certain degree of badness in a slasher but even the killings were badbr br first of all the past event that set up the motive for the slaughter went on for 15 or 20 minutes i thought it would never end they could have removed 80 of it and explained what happened well enoughbr br then the victims were invited to the reunion in an abandoned school which still had all the utilities turned on one of the victims thought this was a little odd but they dismissed it and decided to break in anywaybr br finally the killings were so fake as to be virtually unwatchablebr br there is no reason to watch this movie unless you want to see some breasts and not very good breasts at that this movie makes showgirls virtually indistinguishable from citizen kane
1,it seems theres a bit of a curse out there when it comes to gay cinema namely happy endings arent very common beautiful thing excluded gay films tend to end in broken relationships or untimely death and some like come undone just end periodbr br the creators of this horrid piece of nonsense have a thing or two to learn about plot direction and timelines within the first ten minutes of this film i found myself a bit confused and even more so after the first glimpse of jeremie elkaims character having a little psych session it seems this film was randomly pieced together without the slightest attempt at continuity or consistency theres no real way to tell when youre viewing the present or some sort of ethereal flashback i could only take so much before it became truly unappealingbr br stephen holden of the new york times called this film shimmeringly beautiful and utterly real well it seems that stephen invested in beer goggles prior to viewing as this is truly far from beautiful due to all the praise this film received i expected something worth watching sadly the film lived down to its title and by the end of the movie which provided no resolution whatsoever i might add its plain to see that the writers the director and the film have all come undone
5,kevin kline and meg ryan are among that class of actors which i am always interested in seeing despite reviews i have always found ms ryan to be a charming and winsome actress in nearly all her roles and kevin kline is almost always worth watchingbr br i say nearly and almost in large part because of this moviebr br first off meg ryan does not play a likeable character she plays a weakwilled whiner who begins grating on your nerves shortly after the opening credits and doesnt give up until several days later that said kevin klines character is even more annoying and less likeable so even if you normally like these two actors i recommend your give this movie a pass
6,a callgirl witnesses a murder and becomes the killers next target director brian de palma is really on a pretentious roll here his camera swoops around corners in a museum after lingering a long time over a painting of an ape divvies up into split screen for arty purposes practically gives away his plot with a sequence again in split screen where two characters are both watching a tv program about transsexuals and stages his first finale during a thunderous rainstorm dressed to kill is exhausting primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and gives back nothing substantial much of the acting with the exception of young keith gordon is mediocre and the second finale is a ripoff of de palmas own carrienot to mention psycho the explanation of the dirty deeds plays like a spoof of hitchcock not an homage stylish in a steely cold way the end results are distinctly halfbaked  from

1,anyone that has see tammuzs child eaters knows that this is a director that can do better lets hope it was not a case of too many hands in the pot telefilm anyoneand that is was a case of second feature jitters the characters are one dimensional and over used the scenery is terrific however and showcases the pacific northwest beautifullybr br the cinematography is great shot almost entirely outside the images are crisp and beautiful you can almost smell the wind blowing through the leavesbr br technically this movie is as sound as they come  it just lacks a heart
5,this was a personal favorite of mine when i was young it had everything that was great with 90s kids movies lovable dinosaurs cute kids an eccentric villain and a few great songs and not the typical little mermaidbeauty and the beast type songs but ones that are atually entertaining i ran into this movie again recently and i still love it as much as ever i recommend that everyone of every age should see this movie and i definitely think that it should be introduced to the younger generations sorry not the most informative im in kinda a rush just please trust me all who go against this movie are killing their inner child
1,six degrees is a wonderful show i watched the entire season online since i just found it and was terribly disappointed that there will not be a season  and to top it all off abc has now taken it offline so it is unable to be viewed online anymore why would abc create such a wonderful show with a great story line and with great characters just to pull it off the air without ever completing the tale it seems it is left to our imagination to figure out what happens to all of our connected characters honestly though i feel that abc could at least place the show online for viewers who enjoied it while they continue to air overrated reality tv shows six degrees we will miss you
6,i was seriously looking forward to seeing this film because it seemed truly promising from the coming attractions jim carrey with godlike powers was an idea that most definitely worked for me as a huge fan i was sure hed be supremely in his element with such a promising premise and what could go wrong yesterday my bubble got burst bigtime boys and girls because i saw the movie br br the first act where its set up that he hates his life hes a disgruntled employee and a majorly unhappy camper with an ax to grind against god is serviceable the second act where hes summoned by god via telephone and receives powers almighty is great  carrey gets to have fun with his new toys and its a pleasure to watch really funny but the third act is wretched beyond beliefbr br the rot starts setting in after the dinner scene between bruce and his girlfriend grace jennifer aniston who comes off exceedingly well in this movie considering her part is merely a plot device even her name reeks of unsubtlety  she thinks hes gonna pop the question but instead he tells her on bended knee yet that hes finally getting his news anchor job and isnt it so excitingbr br she doesnt think so she wants him to marry her see so she winds up leaving him see even though she still loves him very much see and the rest of the film is spent banging us over the head with one pathetic beyondheavyhanded spiritualsounding cliche after the next until by the end i was praying too  for it to be over br br i didnt mind the lack of subtlety in the first two acts one example  in the 2nd act after he gets his powers bruce prances into the room singing what if god were one of us just a slob like one of us blah blah blah and i was even willing to overlook the amazing amount of contradictions being hurled at us for openers morgan freeman  aka god  tells bruce he cant violate anyones free will but he does this a lot those choices were forgivable  this is a jim carrey comedy directed by tom shadyac  it aint the remains of the day br br or rather it was supposed to be a comedy when the script writers lose track of that in the dreaded act and try to turn the proceedings into some sort of gag message movie what we get instead is hell on earth bruce realizes the error of his selfish ways he realizes that grace is his saving  have to say it  grace and that his priorities in life had been severely misconstrued all this could have been conveyed in a far less heavyhanded way however the film didnt have to go into the dumper to make these points unfortunately the writers and shadyac apparently had no idea how to resolve the story in any sort of clever lighthanded way so they went the bangemovertheheads route in hopes that we wouldnt notice they even tacked some surprisingly unfunny outtakes at the end in the further hope that this would lessen the bad taste it didnt work for me
4,clocking in at an interminable three hours and twenty minutes salaameishq is a pretty but superficial comic soap opera from india that regales us with six interwoven tales of romantic love which is at least four tales too many in my estimationbr br filmed like a cross between an mtv music video and a super bowl beer commercial the movie is a sprawling mishmash of exotic settings dazzling colors sexy showgirls highstepping songanddance numbers dream and fantasy sequences winking character asides corny dialogue and wayoverthetop comical performances  all pretty much standardissue stuff when it comes to bollywood happenings these days its an exhausting chore just trying to keep all the characters straight as they dance prance and preen their way through the incomprehensible storylinebr br theres plenty for the viewer to feast his eyes on here  not least of all all the drop dead gorgeous women  but hell need the patience of job to get him all the way through it
2,well what can you say about a barbara cartland adaptationbr br there are some amazing actors in this oliver reed sarah miles christopher plummer but they clearly are clocking up the moneybr br lysette anthony and marcus gilbert have appeared in two other cartland epics  anthony with hugh grant who looks suitably embarrassed and gilbert with helena bonham carterbr br if you really want to see a watchable adaptation of cartland the bonham carter one is the one to go for a hazard of hearts  what a title gilbert is the weak link in that but bonham carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek edward fox  diana rigg
1,four tales of terror regarding the events at a creepy old mansion are recounted to sceptical scotland yard investigator holloway john bennett as he investigates the whereabouts of the latest occupant of the house that dripped bloodbr br one can only struggle to find the words to describe the true brilliance that is the house that dripped blood this seventies horror anthology is quite remarkable in the way that such a visually innocent movie is capable of inducing horror in even the most discerning of viewers incredibly the number of depictions of violence onscreen can be counted on one hand but the film is still able to portray brutality and succeeds in conjuring up the most horrific images in the viewers own imagination all the while refraining from taking the obvious route of graphic violence in a rare feature of early seventies horror the technicalities of the movie are virtually flawless from the faultless performances of the starstudded cast featuring the legendary peter cushing christopher lee and ingrid pitt all the way to the superb direction and story telling courtesy of peter duffell and master of the macabre writer robert bloch the author of the novel psycho the only real complaints that one may have with the house that dripped blood are the somewhat asinine plottwists at the end of the first two segments and the predictable ending of the picture but even these minor details fail to detract from the overall viewing enjoymentbr br the first segment entitled method for murder tells the story of charles hillyer denholm elliott a horror author who rents the creepy house while he works on his latest novel while working on the novel hillyer continues to start seeing the murderous character from his story in and around the house and soon begins to question the difference between fiction and reality elliotts performance in this piece is truly exceptional and his character is given a surprising air of believability the key to this segment as with the others is the mystery surrounding the events that take place the viewer is made to question whether the sight of the murderous character of dominic is merely a hallucination a schizophrenic disorder or whether the character is actually there duffells direction succeeds in creating an unsettling atmosphere coupled with a slow methodical approach to engendering the tension and suspense required to make the segment greatly enthrallingbr br the following segment features peter cushing as the new occupant of the sinister house during a trip into town he comes across a wax museum of horrors and decides to venture in while there he discovers a wax model of a beautiful woman that seems all too familiar to him cushings character philip is then joined by his friend neville joss ackland who also wishes to visit the museum much to the dismay of philip in this segment the viewer is given no more than very subtle clues as to the mystery of the wax woman but in general the viewer is left in the dark there is far less tension to this particular story yet the segment still succeeds in maintaining its air of mystery through a particularly harrowing dream sequence and the general ambiguity of the story duffells direction is once again exceptional and while this is quite possibly the weakest of the four stories there is no denying that through some creative direction and credible acting waxworks is still a delightful entry into the filmbr br waxworks is followed by what is in my opinion the greatest of the four segments  sweets to the sweet christopher lee stars as john reid the father to a young girl who to begin with has an inexplicable fear of fire which is soon remedied by caring nanny ann norton nyree dawn porter however john appears to be harbouring a dark secret about the family sweets to the sweet is easily the most sober and intricate of the four stories and that is why the segment is undeniably compelling to the viewer throughout the segment small and subtle clues are released about the truth behind the family but it is not until the immensely horrific final scene that everything slots neatly into place this is the best example of how duffell used dramatic tension and suspense to create the foreboding atmosphere that made the entire film great accompanied by a wonderfully arranged soundtrack sweets to the sweet is an exercise in sustained fear that grabs the viewer by the throat and refuses to let go until the agonising screams that end this piece finally cease personally i believe that this short segment would have made an entertaining and haunting feature length movie and i would give this segment a rare 1010br br the film is ended with the story surrounding the missing performer that the investigator was originally interested in jon pertwee and ingrid pitt star as two performers who are currently working on a horror movie pertwees character is disgusted with the amateurish production and props of the film and so he purchases his own vampire cloak from a strange shop of mysteries however strange things begin to happen when he wears the cloak and soon he begins to fear the worst this segment which places the inspector amongst the events is a nice way to wrap up a wonderful anthology although there is an irrefutable air of camp to the segment this is in a way what makes the story so enjoyable unfortunately there is little in this segment that could be classed as frightening in any sense and the predictable ending could have been executed better but nonetheless the segment has its redeeming features horror buffs should definitely look out for pertwees brief comment on bela lugosis and christopher lees portrayal of dracula this slightly comical and lighthearted approach to the final segment is in essence an adequate and almost natural way of ending the picture even if it lets down the film when compared to the earlier examples of suspensedriven horrorbr br to sum up the house that dripped blood is one of the greatest horror anthologies that features an incredible cast great stories and above par direction there are certainly worse ways to spend one hundred minutes of your life and while blood and guts fans will be highly disappointed fans of more tense horror efforts should enjoy this film immensely my rating for the house that dripped blood  810
0,hammerhead is a combination between the mad scientist and killer shark movie genres in a bit of typecasting jeffrey combs plays the aforementioned mad scientist who develops a humanhammerhead shark creature bizarrely this being is in fact his son who he has turned into this monster to prevent him dying from cancer or somethingbr br a group of associates are invited to the scientists private island they end up being used as shark bait or shark mate for some unknown reason the head of it has been brought along as part of this team who knows why luckily he turns out to be a resourceful if somewhat overweight ramboesque hero im working on the assumption that he learnt how to handle an assault rifle as part of his day job working in 1st line support a normal day for this it man presumably involves fixing someones network connection followed by a call to gun down guntoting evildoers or perhaps a call to fix someones pc has to be scheduled between physical confrontations with landbased humanshark hybrids anyway hes amazing and saves the day he even gets the girlbr br the sharkman is a slightly lame creation but ok i guess judging by the effects in general in this film and the movie moves on at a decent pace its complete hokum of course but if you buy a movie called hammerhead and expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts experienced by a man turned into a landbased killer fish then really you have no one to blame but yourself as it is there are guns gore girls and possibly even an exploding helicopter its rubbish but not as bad as some might say
7,actually goldie hawn is from washington takoma park maryland but i digress this is sort of a mr smith goes to washington type of movie with some variations but the same premise i taped this movie off of cable years ago because i had a huge crush on goldie hawn the story is interesting but its highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shots life it made me laugh and made me mad at the same time it made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous i had to laugh possible spoiler ahead it made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up and the speech she made at the endbeautiful too bad not many people have guts like that in real life
2,this is such a great movie call me anna because it shows how a person has suffered for so long without knowing what was wrong with her for patty duke to come out in the publics eye and tell her story is an inspiration to those who suffer from this disease i have a lot of respect for her as a person the only thing i dont like is i cant get it on tape ive tried looking for it but with no success any one know how to get it
1,what is so taboo about love people seem to have major problems with the transgeneredbr br the title of this movie didnt catch my eye it was a grainy shot about minutes into the movie is what made me stop channel surfing i could not believe how freaking amazing this film was it touches on so many levels of human emotion that it did not once fail to move me in some way it is by far one of the best independent films i have ever seen i did not view these characters as either gender just human i would recommend it to anyone who loves movies especially independent films praise to all fearless filmmakers
0,the big bad swim has a low budget indie feel about it so many times i start to watch independent films that have had really good reviews only to find out they are pretentious crud voted for by people who are so blinded by the idea of the film and its potential to be provocative that they forget that film is a form of entertainment first and foremostbr br i do not know if the big bad swim has any message or higher meaning or metaphor if it does then i missed itbr br from the get go bbs felt right it was easy and warm and human there were no major dramas or meaningful insights i just connected with the characters straight off and when as with all good films the end came around i felt sadness at the loss of that connectionbr br if you are looking for something big or fast or insightful look elsewhere look for a film trying to deliver more than it can bbs delivers a solid enjoyable real experience and i felt rewarded and satiated having watched it
7,serious home alonekarate kid knock off with enough bad character stereotypes to have the writer sued and then shot you could see blatant stunt man usage in almost every scene oh and the acting sucks too although i must say that the line sorry dude i have to take a major dump big time made me laugh my ass off
2,people expect no less than brilliant when steven spielberg directs a movie and this movie is no exception some movies i love did poorly at the box office but im glad to say this movie isnt one of them over nine million dollars which i dont think was bad for back then the characters were fun the animation was clear and not fuzzy and the music was modern too which is unusual for an animated movie i didnt think professor screw eyes or his scary cirus was too scary for little kids the targeted audience for this movie but i thought what happened to the creepy professor at the end was a little too dark for a kids movie overall this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that i have loved dearly for years

7,whats this a canadian produced zombie flick that i have never heard of before a mortician works on the body of a recently deceased young man this allows for an extended flashback that show how the guy got there basically he and friends went to a cemetery on friday the 13th and raised the dead thanks to his silly chanting cut back to the morgue where our dead body comes back to life and kills the mortician and owner who gets his eyes popped out the final wtf shot has the funeral home owner in a straight jacket and screaming im not crazy amazingly he has his eyeballs backbr br running a scant 58 minutes this is certainly one oddity in zombie cinema it feels a lot longer but put me in some kind of trance where i couldnt stop watching the film also has one of those if you see this image turn away from the screen gags it is the image of an old man getting sick in a theater prophetic and when he pops up only twice the blood begins to flow the scenes are pretty damn gory for the time period there is a great gaffe where a zombie chops off a girls right hand with a shovel but  when he pulls the fake hand into the frame to chomp on  it is a left hand
0,the movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in 1996 and it starred melissa joan hart and daniel baldwinbr br the main protagonistantagonist jennifer stanton hart is a typical all american teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father baldwin however when she meets an ex con called nick ryan jeremy jordan never been kissed they instantly fall for each other but jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship she manipulates him to kill her parents to protect their love but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with brad david lascher future sabrina cast mate for hart melissa joan hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie well by using her friends and nick so she can literally get away with murder the rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time i also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year hart began portrayed sabrina the teenage witch and this shows she can act in my genres of film and televisionbr br although the film has dated somewhat it stills stands out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am looking forward to nine dead that comes out in november because it shows she can seen as other people that are not called clarissa darling  or sabrina spellmanbr br i recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of melissa joan hart or sabrina you can watch this on the internet so i suggest check it out
1,the saddest thing about this film is that only people cared to leave a review of it and noone felt it worthwhile leaving a comment on the message boardsbr br made the same year as philadelphiathe tom hanks oscarwinner this is the film that people really should have seen and given awards to there is more humanity life love tenderness and beauty in these two people than in just about any other gay film i have seen and it is all truebr br in order for this to be printed i need to leave a few more lines of text suffice it to say that anyone who really wants to know what it was like to be gay in the 60s and 70s and to understand just what aids was like before the modern drug cocktails allowed people to breathe a little easier this is the film to see br br oh and i will add a personal comment about aids despite everything there actually has been a silver lining to all the horror when aids first arrived it was called the gay cancer and governments preferred to let them die rather than spend a red cent on research to help save a bunch of fags then it became clear that aids would also be a heterosexual disease but the government wasnt ready for that so when straight people began getting ill too the only organizations and associations that were available to them were those which had been set up by gays themselves examples the names project the quilt memorializing all those who died of aids act up etc the result is that people who probably would never have come in contact with gays in their ordinary lives suddenly found themselves counting on them and needing them because no other organizations existed this close contact in my estimation is what finally broke down the barriers of prejudice and allowed the straight world to finally accept gays as equals when aids first came on the scene many of us thought that the straight world would use it as a way to come down even harder on us and that probably would have been true if straights didnt suddenly become ill too nevertheless the strides that have been made in gay liberation  to the point that as i write this there are at least countries in the world that accept gay marriage  these gains would probably have taken a lot longer without aids to bring us together it is sad to think that all those people  both straight and gay  had to die before our common humanity became more obvious  but if what i am writing here is true and i think it is  then there is a bit of comfort to be taken in realizing that all those people did not die in vain
7,i always enjoy seeing movies that make you think and dont just dripfeed the answers to their audience revolver is one of these films and although many reviewers have stated that it is difficult to follow with a bit of concentration and an open mind i got it first time true it doesnt compare to other mindmucks like the usual suspects or memento but in its own right its an intelligent and thoughtprovoking film br br another thing i really liked about this film is how damn beautiful it is every scene every camera angle seems to have been thought about for ages if you see it youll know what i meanbr br so to conclude watch it with an open mind and you may enjoy it if not well noone ever said revolver is for everyone and thats my cents
2,i saw this film for the first time not too long on tcms essentials series the eye of the beholder clich was never more apropos this beholder saw little of value in this one i was puzzled by the infinite attraction that lucy lauren bacall possessed granted ms bacall was a beautiful woman but in this film her character comes off more mousy than attractive i would think men like mitch wayne and kyle hadley would more likely ignore lucy than fall into an instant infatuation with her in bacalls defense this film was made at the time of humphrey bogarts last illness and the weight of his deteriorating health may have affected her performance of course part of this mousiness on the part of lucy was to contrast her to slutty marylee played to the hilt and beyond by dorothy malone the scene where she engages in a wildly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack is far and away the best scene in the film malones performance outshines the rest although jasper hadleys weariness at the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by robert keith generally though i would have to say that im just not much of a fan of melodrama the cartoonish behavior of the characters just makes for a story too implausible for my tastes
1,billy wilder is cocredited for the story and his unsentimental touch is noticeable in this quite original tale of ghostwriting songwriters who both work for burntout music legend oliver courtney the obvious misunderstandings are gotten out of the way quite quickly thank heaven and what remains is a witty and breezy concoction with some fine songs and some more forgettable ones crosby at his most charming a great turn by broadway legend mary martin and basil rathbone and oscar levant providing most of the cynical barbs levant is in rare form and his quips havent dated at all a delightful surprise and recommended for all fans of the genre
0,what else is left to saybr br ive read all the reviews here and most are right on  however one person even went so far as to call this movie evil and that satan tainted it or something along those lines evil wow what a shocker  i mean tbn basically made this film open your eyes pleasebr br anway this was the very lowest grade of propoghanda nonsense that has come along in yearsbr br the most terrifying thing about omega code is how much money they spent to make it if this movie can be made there are no limits and therefore we have no choice but to get ready for yentl and ernest loses the omega codesbr br for those of you who are into the biblical stories the new movie dogma will pickup where omega code never started
7,this entire movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment  its the best ending of any movie ive ever seen perfect beautiful funny simply wonderfulbr br i found this movie delightful even with its french takingitselftooseriously deep meanings thing going on i loved it  its a great love story and i loved the way algerians were woven in  and by the way the music during the final credits is great i want the cd
5,a terrible movie containing a bevy of dlist canadian actors who seem so selfconscious about the fact they are oncamera that their performances are overly melodramatic and quite forgettablebr br this film is badly written badly edited and badly directed it is disjointed incomprehensible and bizarre  but not in a good way mcdowell does a great job with what he is given but is the only one in this film to do so  he really has a bad story and script to work with its not even camp enough to be funnybr br i have yet to see van pelleske act in a credible manner and even the subcharacters like eisen with his nasal whiny voice confirm that we are on a lot in toronto rather than on a barge off africabr br didnt the director see that the creature looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit the fight between the blue bolts of lightning and pelleskes orange wisps of magic  for lack of a better word is obviously the result of bad actors with no choreographer overlaid with completely derivative special effects was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this disaster film not the good kind br br learn from the mistakes of others  dont even waste your time with this one youll regret it like i did i have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid
0,this film i thought was the great journey that forrest gump should have been its a rare treat to watch a cable movie in the middle of the day and come across a foreign film that is done so well this film is very well acted and i strongly suggest it to anyone who can take subtitles

4,corny i love it corny  just as the tv show was about 40 years ago adam and burt rekindle the same onscreen chemistry that never seems to have left they relive old memories plus the actors that play them from the 1960s show some behindthescenes things which are quite interesting to know 1960s tv was corny escapism for so many of us back then and this dvd is no exception if you are familiar with the original tv show the fight scene with the written boofs and bams or whatever is fantastic the movie theater scene shows clips of the villains who passed away at the end frank gorshin makes an appearance he passed away not too long after this dvd was made i believe so it is to his great credit that he came back to again play a villain to adam and burt just as he did to batman  robin so many years ago he didnt lose his touch thanks to julie newmar to reliving a villain role also in conclusion i think that this dvd is for great memories and i wish to thank both adam and burt for coming back and recreating these memories for those of us who remember the original thanks guys
7,documentary about nomadic persians making a treacherous traverse of massive mountains to get their herds to grass watching this silent black and white feature marred in part by a twinktwinktwink oriental music score that could not have been used in the original exhibition is even duller than it sounds the spectacular scenery is lost on a small black and white screen and there is an utter failure to establish any kind of plot line i loved nanook of the north and march of the penguins but despised this movie notwithstanding the similarity of the theme physical hardships alone are just not that interesting
0,its got christopher lee its got huge banks of 1970s computers that make teletype noises as letters appear on the screen its got radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark but emit pulsing thrumming noises its got volcanoes evil aliens disguised as nuns tidal waves earthquakes exploding cars exploding coffee machines and as a climax the entire planet blows up how on earth does this film managed to be so incredibly mindnumbingly dull the answer my friend is because 90 of this movie is made up of establishing shots most of them involving long tracks pans or zooms in combinations or occasionally all three that do nothing except give the crew something to do there are endless shots of our protagonists driving getting in and out of cars driving again walking around looking at stuff getting in cars and driving i just sat there watching endless parade of nothingness in stupefaction muttering say something please somebody just say something do something anythingbr br the dialogue when it does come is terriblebr br maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale than ours was a typically meaningless line the script culminates in the destruction of the world by stock footage justified in this speech from lee as the head alienbr br the planet earth has emitted an overabundance of diseases they are contaminating the universe all the planets light years away from here will suffer unless it is destroyed br br this is is neanderthal sf script writing this is the sort of motivation you find in the sort of 1950s japanese monster suit movies aimed at year olds it is and i collect such things the most godawful line from an english language sf movie since buster crabbe retired it beggars belief that this movie was released in the same year as star wars and close encountersbr br lee who always struck me as a smart useful actor with a sure knowledge of his limits delivers his lines as if he is going to kill his agent for getting him into this pile of drek i dont blame him
7,i checked this movie out based on a favorable review on this page it is slow moving and the payoff is a four star dudthe only mystery here is how oscar winner f murray abraham got involved with such a lousy script
6,poorly structured badly written loaded with cliches and flat dialogue not a single scene shines the actors struggle with a painfully dull scenario that manages to completely avoid any surprises plot twists or conflict you know from the first ten minutes where its goingbr br for a movie set in ny it has almost no feeling for the city there are a dozen other indie movies that manage to make it seem magical on a small budget this one seems like it was shot in torontobr br if you cast natasha henstridge why dress her in baggy sweaters why make vartan look boring and drab wheres the attraction i felt like i was watching a subpar christian movie of the week it was so asexual and moralizingbr br steven feders big success is that he convinced people to make this bland movie
5,almost too well done john carpenters vampires was entertaining a solid piece of popcornentertainment with a budget small enough not to be overrun by special effects and obviously aiming on the from dusk till dawnaudience vampires los muertos tries the same starting with a rockstar jon bon jovi playing one of the main characters but does that almost too well i havent seen jon bon jovi in any other movie so i am not able to compare his acting in vampires los muertos to his other roles but i was really suprised of his good performance after the movie started he convinced me not expecting him to grab any guitar and playing it my life or something but kill vampires showing no mercy and doing a job which has to be done this means a lot because a part of the audience also me was probably thinking just because hes a rockstar of course bon jovi is not james woods but to be honest it could have been much worse and in my opinion bon jovi did a very good performance the vampiress played by arly jover is not the leather dressed killermachine of a vampireleader we met in part or in similar way in ghosts of mars jover plays the vampire very seductive and very sexy moving as lithe as a cat attacking as fast as a snake and dressed in thin light almost transparent very erotic cloth and even the optical effects supporting her kind of movement are very well made it really takes some beating but the director is in some parts of the film only just avoiding turning the movie from an actionhorrorfilm into a sensitive horrormovie like murnaus nosferatu you can almost see the directors temptation to create a movie with a very personal note and different to the original this is the real strength of the movie and at the same time its weakest point the audience celebrating the funbloodbath of the first movie is probably expecting a pure funbloodbath for the second time and might be a little disappointed make no mistake vampireslos muertos is a funbloodbath but its just not all the time this kind of movie just think of the massacre in the bar compared to the scene in which the vampiress tries to seduce zoey in the ruins the barmassacre is what you expect from american popcornentertainment the seducingzoeyintheruinsscene is almost europeanlike cinema the movie is eager to tell us more about the relationship between zoey and the vampiress but refuses answers at the same time because it would had slow down the action showed the audience a vampiress with a human past a now suffering creature and not only a beast which is just slaughtering anybody and thats the point to me which decides whether the movie is accepted by the audience of the original movie or not and also is the from dusk till dawnaudience really going to like this im not sure about that nevertheless tommy lee wallace did really a great job vampireslos muertos is surprisingly good but i also think to direct a sequel of a popcorn movie wallace is sometimes almost too creative too expressive like hes keeping himself from developing his talent in order to satisfy the expectations of audience in my opinion wallace talent fills the movie with life and is maybe sometimes sucking it out at the same time vampires los muertos is almost too well done i give it of 10
5,just looking at the sets staging and editing it is easy to tell this project lacked a proper budget maybe bela lugosi is meant to take your mind off of things like that young brides drop dead at the altar after saying i do their corpses are stolen by a renowned horticulturist dr lorenzlugosiand a couple of his freakish minions as his aging wifeelizabeth russellneeds injections of the glandular fluids of the young virgins to remain forever youngforever beautiful an eager local cub reporterluana waltersrealizes that each missing bride wore the same rare orchid to the altar an orchid in which dr lorenz would be most knowledgeable a typical horror movie storm brews making a visit to the lorenz estate a bit spooky especially with a dwarf and a slobbering hunchback on the premises other players angelo rossitto tristram coffin minerva urecal and frank moran
7,short synopsis br br this film opens with soldiers being released from the company of men one of them pursues another with a weird scheme the other repeatedly refuses later they both get trapped in an office building in which they want to crack a safe during the christmas holidays hostility turns into playful banter and then into a desperate fight for survival during the bantering they lose all drinkable liquids so it is really serious with exposed well built and well oiled torsos they ram a hole into a wall and finally manage to escape  only to find out that they have been betrayed and set up by women one gets caught the other remains free and is not given away by his companion a last encounter a last light for a cigarette adieu lami farewell friendbr br i found it hard not to see closet homosexuals in the two main characters played by classical heman superstars alain delon and charles bronson they are obviously attracted to each other their treatment of women is abominable and marked by contempt throughout the whole story seems to have a strong symbolic undertow a little like deliverance it is also very stylish the safe the two men want to crack is in a  for the time  ultra modern glass and aluminum tower it is the seat of a publicity firm so there are many fancy posters and wall coverings around the wardrobe is also very good the ultra stylish citroen ds maybe the most modern and elegant car of all times features large in this movie  perhaps a subtle kind of product placementbr br i can recommend this movie for the actors performances alone delon and bronson are really sharing the top billing in a manner that struck me as very fair and sporting both do a considerable amount of acrobatics i have never seen bronson better than here he really acts  and speaks french throughout with a heavy accent buy very passably indeed and it is certainly the man himself we hear so the french language version is highly recommended the police inspector who pursues the two is played by on of my favorite franch character actors bernard fresson who was gene hackmans partner in french connection ii he is the best brainy police inspector i know also very good is former child actress brigitte fossey as the young ingnue who as it turns out is not so innocent as it first seemsbr br anyone who expects the old inanout of classical heist movies might be disappointed with this film for those with a little patience this will be a rewarding experience full of novel and original ideas and directorial quirks although it my be a little too brutal and sadistic for its own sake
4,i am sorry to fans of this film but it is the worst thing i have ever seen slowbadly cast and badly acted it is a film trying to escape the deadbeat romcoms of the recent years and failing mcdonald and parker seem unable to convey real emotion and are lifeless they seem to be in this one for any pay checks they are getting for it and not because they thought it was a good idea the plot is dull i love great chick films as much as the next girl and this is not one if you avoid one film this yearlet it be
5,bad movie  saw it at the tiff and the movie gives me a sense of been there done that  it reminds me alot of the movie blow  expect the blow was actually interestingbr br this one story told two ways and both times it is not told that wellbr br 
2,i am wanting to make a holmes with doors pun but i cant quite string it all together suitably grubby and over edited wonderland gives kilmer a role that channels morrison at the same timebut how coy is this film about the famous 14 inches australian crime films flash it all the time and skip the graphic violence insteadas someone famous said once about us cinema double standards kiss a breast and its an x stab it and its an action pg 13 wonderland is 14 minutes too long too and at the end the tawdry spiral we were all glad to escape the cinema how many films called wonderland are we going to get there must be six in the last decade the pixilated violence and muted color sets the seedy tone but the wobblecam gets tiresome as if we are gawking at their nostrils all the time taking a few cues form the doors and taxi driver it all becomes forgettable the next day
4,upon the first viewing i found this tale to be at least less annoying than other cannon movie tales after many more i think its one of the best some of the songs are pretty bad especially the love song but two things stand out that make the movie even the singing worthwhile one is the art direction like the other cannon movie tales this is a beautifully decorated period piece every piece of cloth and jewel both of which have major parts in this movies plot look fresh and new and contrast with the plain clothes of the peasants even during the love song i find myself studying the dress and hair of the princess wonderfully done the other thing is the comic timing a lot of the movie is cheesy but the emperors vanity and his making fun of himself in the end the suspicious guard the guard chasing nicholas and the stupid prince were all quite funny and seem to be ridiculous quite on purpose and the sequence during the song weaveo makes up for the songs that werent so good
6,this is exactly the sort of saturday matinee serial i loved during world war ii i was under ten years of age and thats the audience this serial is designed for looking at it now one must roar at its ineptitude and stupidity the budget must have been next to nothing given the shortcuts and repeats the acting well this is republic pictures 1944 they read the linesand no doubt had one take to make them convincingbr br one and half stars
4,first of all i am a huge fan of madeleine lengle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books a wrinkle in time this movie however ruined that excitement for me i am sorry but meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool in the movie she has straight hair and no glasses and is the sporty type with a deep voice this is not how madeleine lengle pictured meg to be at all in fact meg was based on madeleines character and depicted the way she felt when she was young this is just one major example how the book and movie are different so i would say if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes watch it but if you are a devoted fan of madeleine lengle and her wrinkle in time series i would suggest skipping this movie
5,tony scott has never been a very good director but every film hes made after crimson tide seems to bring him one step closer to being the inarguable worst working today michael bay may fall into the same category but at least his big dumb delusional epics entertain on some primally perverse level and like other overblown hollywood biopics delovely and confessions of a dangerous mind for instance chronicling the lives of pretentious overrated or outright shallow ciphers given an aura of mystique by a society that thrives on the juicy behindthescenes details domino is a film that begins with little potential and dashes that infinitesimal amount before the sixtyminute mark with an alreadydistended running time of 128 minutes the film feels twice as long and spending time with characters this obnoxiously superficial and forgettable unlike the superior rules of attraction scotts attempts to tinge the proceedings with irony via dominos smug selfawarerichgirl voiceover only draws attention to the films sledgehammer cluelessness becomes an act only masochists could find pleasurable the story spoileduppercrustbabe domino harvey keira knightley in an ersatzbadass performance as shallow as her gorgeous looks is sick of the shallow lifestyles of the rich and famous in los angeles and accosts gruff bounty hunters mickey rourke and edgar ramirez to learn a more exciting trade along the way there are doublecrosses shootouts media attention courtesy of a tongueincheek christopher walken phoning in his trademark sleazebag and laughable hints at romance scott cuts the film together in segments that rarely last more than a few seconds cranking up the resolution to make the film a neondrenched nightmare thats frankly unpleasant to watchif scotts given an opportunity to shakily frame an image ghost it or distort it in some way he will but all this tacky stylistic overload overwhelms what little plot characterization and suspense the film has to say nothing for its ehm entertainment value most of the characters come off as either contemptible or stereotypical oftentimes both observe the unbearable severalminute segment where an africanamerican introduces a new list of racial categorizations on jerry springer and i found myself wishing they would all get the tails end of our protagonists coin by the end domino is utter unmitigated trashwhatever interest in this individual scott hoped to inspire in his audience it is lost in a sea of migraineinducing neon pretension a few minutes in
3,its great how this movie pulls you along i had honest laughs dont care that its low budget cause the thing works for me to be honest my wife didnt really go for it in the same way but she prefers a different type of film she did admit though that it was very creative and well put together and probably all on a shoe string these characters whos lives are strange and troubled give me something to relate to in my own world just keep going and be who you are dreams are what you make of them in watching this movie a second and third time i realized that there are some hidden moments that passed by me on the first time through what can i say i like my fun with some complexity anyway liked it hope to see more
0,i remember i loved this movie when it came out i was 12 years old had a commodore 64 and loved to play rambo on it i was therefore really thrilled when i got to buy this movie really cheap i put it in my vcr and started up man this movie is really bad sylvester stallone says like words in the entire movie except for that awful sentimental speech at the end and has the same expression on his face all the way and that stupid love thing in the middle its just so amazingly predictable i just ended up fast forwarding the entire thing and went to exchange the movie for something else
5,i stopped by bb and picked up zombie flicks to watch over the weekend now i understand that the effects will be cheesy the acting will be subpar and the sets will be suspect so im not expecting much but it should at least have a story stories dont cost a thing except timeapparently they didnt have any time eitherbr br zombie nation had zombies that appeared near the end of the movie that all looked like new wave hookers the picture of the zombie on the front cover never appears in the movie it was absolutely agonizing to watch and had nothing to offer the genrebr br the running time is only 81 minutes but it felt like hours according to my wife who could only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room it sounded like zombie pornwhich if you think about sounds kinda grossbut it wasnt even that goodbr br the only suggestion i can make is that maybe the writer tried to do too many things and ended up with an incoherent messbr br it ended up being a free rental and i still feel ripped off i rated it a out of 10 because imdb wont allow me to use decimals
2,how is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the resemblance with that other better flemish movie congo express 1986 there are also some characters in congo express put together without having really a relation to each other jean de congolees the workman the two taxidrivers the streetsinger roger guy lucienne and gilbert of course tom barman is a star and luc gubbels wasnt that should not be a reason to pardon the flaws in the script if there is a script of anyway the wind blows the joke the only one at the party about the ice in the refrigerator is taken from that great flemish movie de witte 1934 where de witte is putting too much salt on the potatoes some accidents happen in the movie but there comes no explanation after tom barman delivers us here a movie that is more like an experiment to watch at the television than a movie for the theatres another missed chance for flemish cinema
0, or an audience a quick recapbr br so youve got this doctor whos been experimenting with stolen body parts for some vague reason he wants to perfect transplants but feels he needs to do this in his basement wtf and then suddenly unfortunately and conveniently his fianc gets her head cut off in a traffic accident that hes responsible for agonized with grief he preserves her head in a lasagna pan or is it strudel and pumps it full of adrenoserum sic to keep it alive and then she awakes talking her head off so to speak even though her neck was obviously severed at the vocal cords and she has no lungs so she couldnt speak even if she had em seems the ungrateful btch doesnt appreciate all that her fianc has done for her just like a womanbr br then his grief turns to horniness as he sees the possibility of grafting his beloveds head onto the body of the first sleazy bimbo he can pick up off the street meanwhile the doctors assistant a sort of dimestore igor gets into philosophical arguments with the head who has struck up a telekinetic friendship with the monster in the closet every mad scientist has one eventually the screenwriter realizes that he cant keep inflicting his misogyny and fear of intimacy issues on the audience ad infinitum so he kills everybody then presumably goes to the bank to cash the check before the movies financial backers have a chance to stop payment on it br br have i mentioned that i think this is a bad moviebr br someone should tell turner classic movies to stop showing that edited version without the gory stuff the sight of the assistant with his arm ripped off pirouetting around the house without leaving much blood anywhere is just too precious
7,what happens when you give a free man just enough money to trap him into the rat race and watch him squirm homeless people answer to no one they have no mortgages rent payments or idiot bosses homeless people dont have to worry about the irs or performance reviews or credit card payments but give them just enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car and suddenly they have to worry about entering the rat race buying gas for transportation paying insurance on their car and working for someone else they get a chance to be a productive citizens this film was about as exploitive as a film can be its a way for the rich and middleclass sheeple to say see what happens when you try to help the poor and it vindicates capitalistic arrogancebr br why not a film that asks what happens when you take away everything a rich man has
1,well what can i say other than these people are super in every way i quite like sharon mcreedy i enjoy this pure nostalgic series and i have the boxed set of discs 30 episodes i did not realise that they had made so many i also think that it is a great shame that they have not made any more i wish that i got given these powers imagine me being knocked off my cycle somewhere and being knocked out cold then waking up in a special hospital later on i discover that my body has been enhanced just like richard barrat these stories are 50 minutes of pure action and suspense all the way you cannot fight these people as they would defeat you in all forms of weaponry the music is well written and to me puts a wonderful picture of super beings in my mind the sort of powers that the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cats improved sight improved hearing and touch and the strength of 10 men for richard and craig and the strength of women for sharon who i thought was beautiful and intelligent when i was a boy i had a huge crush on her now i can see why on my dvd set the box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet all about the series i also thought that trymane was a good boss firm but he got things done
2,i must say that during my childhood im quite proud of a lot of the movies ive rented the exception being theodore rex talk about the all time swindler movie in any actors resume could you just imagine what whoopies fired agent must have told her to sign on to this piece of crap hey whoop you ever seen that show dinosaurs yeah well theyre making a movie out of it and you get to see germany after that that agent must have referenced star wars a lotbr br this movie was so bad i figured whoopie must have bought out every copy of this film and had it destroyed i just wish she could have done the same thing to my memory because my sister still gives me crap for watching that movie i mean cmon ill even admit i watched mr nanny and kazzam in theaters good reasons why i gave up on both hulk hogan and shaq for awhile yet this one sticks out in my mind as the worst of my childhood and the biggest rental regret of my life and that was 16 years ago im 24 now if you want to do the mathbr br whenever i think of my alltime list of worst movies i dont even mention this one because like a raped stepchild i try hard to repress that it ever happened screw you whoopie just be glad people only acknowledge eddie and sister act as your worst you lucky stiff
0,this movie was advertised on radio television magazines etc almost every hour or every issue so when we went to the kinnepolis multiplex our expectations were very high but oh boy how sad this movie is it is a movie in hollywood style about a movie in a movie shades shows so clear we arent ready to produce big hollywood movies i am not a movie critic but i think a good movie starts with a good script and the script is a nightmare like my subject line says it is nothing and then looped you could just stare to the television as well without really seeing anything that was the feeling weve got when we saw shades shades is a bad production
2,hi im a friend of werewolf movies and when i saw the title of darkwolf hitting the shelves i was like hmm simple and nice name to it at least althou i wonder why i havent heard of it beforebr br first of all the movie starts with tits lots of tits tits are pretty much all this movies budget went to who cares about a werewolf effect just pay the actresses enough to get topless shotsbr br so about the mysterious darkwolf character a little spoilers ahead but who really cares hes your average everyday biker not even supertough looking but like the old wise woman says in the movie he is far more powerful and dangerous than youve ever faced before just by describing her a tattooed bikertype of a guy pretty original i even had look twice when they first used the red glowing eyes special effect i mean my god that letsplantreddotsoneyeswithcomputer effect has been used since the seventies it looks plain ugly here and dont get me started with the werewolf 3dcgi as said before like an bad and old video gamebr br and finally as i do like werewolf films like i said they prettymuch always build a werewolflegend of their own darkwolf does build the werewolfworld as well about some silly legends of hybridwerewolves and the ancient bloodline but it almost instantly after creating the rules of engagement the darkwolf kills anyone the girl has touched starts randomslashing which just doesnt make any sense why even bother telling us the rules of killing when they arent even gonna play by them aplus the wolfpointofview shots are made with a sony handycam or something filming mostly the floor and walls just add growling noises and youve got a super werewolf effect the gore is partially ok but when the wolf slashes everyone with an open hand just by basically laying the hand on top of the victims it just doesnt do the trick for mebr br truly who gives money to make these heaps of junk straighttovideo horrortitles they arent even funnykind of bad movies just sad
0,this 1973 remake of the classic 1944 billy wilder film double indemnity is a textbook example of how to destroy a great script this gradeb tv fodder also illustrates the folly of remakes in general while hollywood has gone after greedy executives that colorize blackandwhite films and sought disclaimers on widescreen movies that are shown in panandscan versions the industry has ignored the hacks that insist on taking a classic film and diminishing it with a shoddy remakebr br the first step in producing a bowdlerized version of a classic is to edit the script the billywilderraymondchandler work was cut by a half hour to fit the finished film into a specified timeslot with room for commercials then update the production with bland color photography smart upscale sets and tvfamiliar actors thus the brandnew double indemnity eliminates the atmospheric blackandwhite filmnoir cinematography that enhanced the mood and characterizations of the original gone are the dusty shadowy claustrophobic sets that explained the protagonists desires to escape their situations at whatever cost gone are the close bond between keyes and neff and the erotic attraction between neff and phyllisbr br the look of jack smights take on double indemnity is more dynasty than film noir phyllis dietrickson has a designer home to die for and neffs comfy pad would be hard to afford on an insurance salesmans salary not to mention the sporty mercedes convertible that he drives neither character has any apparent motive to murder for a paltry 200000 if not money then perhaps murder for love or lust not in this version richard crenna shows little interest in samantha eggar and their kisses are about as lusty as those between a brother and a sister crenna fails to capture the cynicism of neff and his attempts at doubleentendre and sexual suggestiveness fall horribly flat eggar is little better and lacks sensuality and the depth to suggest the inner workings of a supposedly devious and manipulative mind only lee j cobb manages a creditable performance as keyes director jack smight and his three principals have all done much better workbr br there was no conceivable reason to produce this wretched remake except to fill time in a broadcast schedule there was no conceivable reason to resurrect this dud on dvd and package it with the original film except to fill out a doubledisc package the only lesson that can be learned from this misfire is that even a great script and great dialog can be ruined with poor casting lackluster direction and tv grade production values the 1973 double indemnity should be titled 10 indemnity because viewing it only underscores the 100 perfection of the original movie
4,when anyone comes into a film of this type of film its not without saying that an overdose of that great overthecounter brainmedicine suspension of disbelief comes in mighty handybr br jeanette macdonald plays two roles annabrigitta the woman who nelson eddy has ignored since the beginning of time but who also is  an angel sent to earthbr br my reaction when i saw this was a mute gasp of hunh where have i seen this before it turns out i have seen it before but in a movie made much later than this one date with an angel a forgettable pile of dreck made in 1987 cashed in on the ethereal beauty of one emmanuelle beart who had no speaking lines also wore a blond wig and made life hell for soapactor michael knight much worse in every conceivable angle with ultralow 80s values but more than likely an updated version of this 1942 turkeybr br anyway not to elaborate this is not a memorable film and stands as a doorstop of information because it was the last time macdonald and eddy neither very good actors but terrific singers would be together playing up the innocence and cleancut romance that they were known for after that you may need a cold shower not because there are any steamy scenes here but to get rid of the memory
7,i was watching this movie on fridayapr 7th i didnt see the last scene  cos i was talking with my bro n mom in law at the same time  anyone can tell me what happened to heri watched slightly that her husband was hearing someone was talking to his wife in the bedroom and then he opened the doorshes dead alreadybr br what happened to her did she kill herself how could she arrange everything like the phone callsmeanwhile shes at home when her husband was talking to this strange admireranyone can explain to meplease i am so so curious  in the endi read that she suffered from multiply disorder personality br br thnks before
2,it was everything this isnt it had pace pop and actors who werent afraid to chew the scenery it also had a decent script this one had me scratching my head if farrah isnt really serious about a career why does she have a manager and why is he wasting his time if kate and barney are artists why do they sign up for the mother of all jiggle shows like the brady bunch movie where robert reed wants to do shakespeare only to find himself on bb they werent industry names but they werent exactly starving either and while they got the history right the poster was released before farrah got the show silverman rejecting pitches for funniest home videos and american idol and spelling promising his baby girl tori someday hell create a show for her obviously did not happenbr br what bothered me was how spellings role is distorted hes shown as the showrunner and creator when he was neither and how he comes up with the idea for ca was is laughablebr br how were spelling and goldberg allowed to enforce farrahs oral contract when the others were signed and why didnt farrah or bernstein tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her inner diva but because majors wanted her to this is why when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting farrah up as the bad girl like suzanne somers it fails because the groundwork was never laid  that was where the threes company pic delivered
2,let me tell you something about this movie i have seen it twice the first time i was a kid and the movie was quite entertaining to me i really liked it i thought it was funny and interesting and the main character was kind of coolbr br i saw it again a few days ago it was horrible really i dont know why i thought it was funny before but now i didnt laugh at all there was nothing even slightly entertaining it was just dumb the story was weak the acting was nothing special there are great actors in this movie but still the acting is mediocre at bestbr br what is the worst is the fact that this movie is racist really dont get me wrong usually i dont complain about racism in movies however i have seen people complaining about the lack of black men in movies like the shaolin temple or about the fact that the only black man in the street fighter is one of the bad guys or whatever you get the point there are people seeing racism everywhere i wonder how would they react to a movie like the meteor man why i will tell you why there are no asians in this movie there are no white people among the good guys in fact there is only one white guy in the entire movie and he is the leader of the bad guys all the good guys are african americans dont get me wrong i dont care is the good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green what i do care about is the fact that we can barely see a white person in this movie this is the only movie like that that i have ever seen it is just not realistic if there is only one black man in a japanese movie which is the case with the street fighter there is no problem  in japan most of the people are asians but if there is only one white man in an american movie there is some sort of problem  in usa most of the people are white it is like filming a japanese movie with entirely white cast and only one asian as a bad guy just not realbr br that is it i am giving the movie the rate of 410 it would be 110 if i hadnt have fun with it as a kid
6,this movie is stuffed full of stock horror movie goodies chained lunatics premeditated murder a mad vaguely lesbian female scientist with an even madder father who wears a mask because of his horrible disfigurement poisoning spooky castles werewolves male and female adultery slain lovers tibetan mystics the halfmanhalfplant victim of some unnamed experiment grave robbing mind control walled up bodies a car crash on a lonely road electrocution knights in armour  the lot all topped off with an incredibly awful score and some of the worst foley work ever donebr br the script is incomprehensible even by badly dubbed spanish horror movie standards and some of the editing is just bizarre in one scene where the lead female evil scientist goes to visit our heroine in her bedroom for one of the badly dubbed that is fantastical i do not understand explain to me again how this is exposition scenes that litter this movie there is a sudden hand held cutaway of the girls thighs as she gets out of bed for no apparent reason at all other than to cover a cut in the bad scientists mwahaha all your werewolfs belong mine speech though why they went to the bother i dont know because there are plenty of other jarring jump cuts all over the place  even allowing for the atrocious pan and scan of the print i sawbr br the director was according to one interview with the star drunk for most of the shoot and the film looks like it it is an incoherent mess its made even more incoherent by the inclusion of werewolf rampage footage from a different film the mark of the wolf man made years earlier featuring the same actor but playing the part with more aggression and with a different shirt and make up  is there a word in spanish for continuity and more padding of another actor in the wolfman getup ambling about in long shotbr br the music is incredibly bad varying almost at random from full orchestral creepy house music to bosannova to the longest piano and gong duet ever recorded thinking about it it might not have been a duet it might have been a solo the piano part was so simple it could have been picked out with one hand while the player whacked away at the gong with the other br br this is one of the most bewilderedly trancestate inducing bad movies of the year so far for me enjoybr br favourite line ilona this madness and perversity will turn against you how truebr br favourite shot the lover discovering his girlfriend slain dropping the candle in a cartoonlike demonstration of surprise rank amateur directing there
0,words cannot describe how utterly abysmal this movie is it is a series of random unfunny clips about everything from a stupid batman spoof to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady really disturbing the only remotely amusing thing about the underground comedy movie is watching joey buttafuoco the best actor in this movie also it is rated nc17 shunning away the only people that might tolerate it
0,this movie got extremely silly when things started to happen i couldnt care less about any of the characters susan walters was so annoying and the leading actor forget his name also got on my nerves cant quite remember how it ended and so forth but the whole idea of aliens possessing human bodies and all just seemed stupid in this film things didnt quite carry off my dad told me its s stupid moviei shouldve listened to him
7,i found the arab conspiracy in a bargain bin and thought id uncovered a lost treasure folks theres a reason why you dont hear much about this film the plot is muddy the pacing is slow cornelia sharpe is about as vivacious as plain cold tofu and the ending leaves you flat not even sean connery can save this one
3,raising victor vargas fails terribly in what it tries most to be being real unfortunately there is no reality to this film the characters and situations feel completely artificial and fakebr br the reason bad directing peter sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal it seems mr sollett read somewhere that not lighting his film would give it an authentic feel wrong it just gives it a badlymade feel similarly shaking the camera does not give a documentary style to your film it just gives the audience a headache and detracts from whats on screen instead of enhance itbr br of course whats on screen is so painfully fake as if mr sollett wrote his script with the only goal of trying to look hip to his sundance buddies and show how edgy a filmmaker he isbr br overall the only lasting impression this film leaves you with is what a bad director mr sollett is next time how about taking a few writing and directing classes
5,oh my god this was so bad the story was weak  at best  and the animation was flat and lifeless  even childish this film takes itself far too seriouslyunless of course they meant to be funny i saw this last week at the london scifi festival and the entire audience was laughing at every scene i think my favourite was shouldnt you be studying medicine at oopsalof and i also think they were trying to see how many times they could cram in the character nicalos only line we will be togetherit is our destiny im sorry but after the first time the words lost all meaningbr br and what was with the applebr br i recommend this as a lesson to americans you cannot animate so please dont try you only embarrass yourselves
5,we have reached the ceiling of implausibility with this movie basically dinosaurs come aboard this ship piloted by some weird old fart named neweyeswhich i needed after i watched this movie apparently neweyes hears the wishes of children everywhere and decides that he should grant the wish of children that dinosaurs be brought into modern times to be seen by everybody for shameless exploitation the dinosaurs eat this stuff that makes them smartertoo bad the screenwriters didnt have it by the way does it seem weird that out of all the wishes of the children in the world neweyes grants the wish of bringing dinosaurs to modern times why not grant the wishes of kids to stop famine disease war i mean come on doesnt neweyes have anything better to do with all this power he has finally when the dinosaurs get to modern times they start singing dancing and wrecking havocbasically the kind of thing you might see on a bad lsd trip i mean where else could you see a trex playing golf and jumping on a balloon of spiderman they end up in the circus and neweyes brother screweyes makes the kids that have befriended the dinosaurs sign a blank contract why why would kids sign a blank contract screweyes says that if the dinosaurs take somebraindrain that he will let the children go the dinosaurs instead of tearing apart the evil screweyes limb from limb give in and agree to his terms what this is stupid they could have just menaced him made him drop the contract eaten it then walked off with the kids i think the filmmakers were trying to show that violence is bad which is a moot point when finally the dinosaurs escape and a bunch of crows envelop screweyes and apparently completely eat him oh yeah thats not violent at all were back makes no sense its not fun its goofy its stupid poorly written and contains some of the biggest plot holes ever committed to film even for a kids film this is bad
6,what was the point of this movie what was the plot i do not know shaq cant act people dont know how to direct and i am kazaam a genie who raps come on maybe eminem or linkin park will be in a movie like this i remember i watched this just to kill time it didnt really interest me i just remember thinking who put shaq in this movie the whole story seemed stupid too it made no sense whatsoever i guess an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen i cant comment much more because this movie is so terrible theres nothing worth commenting about i wish this movie would go away
6,this review may contain some spoilersbr br the remake of the classic 1974 car chase movie gone in 60 seconds begins well actually it is well acted and the plot moves quite well but even a big hollywood budget doesnt change the fact that the original plot was more believable for those who dont know the original plot had the thieves working as insurance inspectors who would suspect them but even with a change to nearly every aspect of hb halickis original the remake is a very good movie until we get to the final chase scene the part of the 74 version that made it great the one in this version is watered down only 10 minutes and it culminates in a monster special effect that takes all believability out of the chase where the original chase was very believable the star was a stunt driver who did all his own stunt the remake falls flat in the last 15 minutes my advice if you want to watch a classic car chase film fine the original in the bargain bin at your local rental joint and stay clear of the new remake
3,between 1937 and 1939 twentieth centuryfox made a ton of mr moto films however towards the end of the series it was obvious that the studio had jumped the shark so to speak this phrase indicates that a tv show has passed its prime and the executives in charge decided to invigorate the show by fundamentally changing the formula for example with the brady bunch they introduced the annoying cousin oliver and with family ties they introduced a freak baby who grew up six years in only one season with the moto films theyd jumped the shark by introducing comic relief because they thought that these intelligent films needed to be retooled in the previous film warren hymer played an annoying wrestler and in this film the character archibald featherstone appears featherstone might just be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief ever as you kept hoping someone preferably moto would kill him just to shut him up although hes supposed to work for the famed scotland yard he shows all the intelligence and acumen of a brain damaged turnip again and again his scenes were boorish and unnecessary and peter lorre just looks pained as he stands there and watches this buffoon act its so bad that it truly destroys what could have been one of the better moto films due to its clever plotbr br as for the plot the crown of the queen of sheba is discovered in the opening scene moto now more of an international policeman than the amoral character he originally was is on hand to protect the precious item from being stolen in a great twist several thieves all try to steal the crown independently of each otherbr br overall the film is watchable but is also ample evidence that the moto series should have ended here with wwii approaching the films couldnt have survived much longer anyway as having a sympathetic japanese leading character simply wouldnt have been accepted in the us or in allied countries
7,this dumb comedy really does a good job of wasting comedic talent in particular dan aykroyd and howard hesseman are misused badly here i might have chuckled once or twice during this film but in general its a boring movie with a little bit of stupidity thrown in for good measure the premise although routine still wasnt bad but once the plot was set the film went nowhere dont waste your time with this misfire
5,this is the worst movie i have seen for years it starts ridicoulus and continues in the same way i thnik when is something going to happen in this film and the the acting is worse the ending lifts it a bit and saves the movie from a total flop mark wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie sorry tim burton batman was good but this one sucks
1,wellmade but basically dreary lowlife melodrama which according to the accompanying interview with lead isabelle huppert writerdirector pialat infused with a good deal of autobiographical detail given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved it doesnt do him any compliments  and he does seem to have been a troubled man as huppert also says that pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot br br the acting is uniformly excellent however despite their relatively young age huppert and costar gerard depardieu as the title character were already at the forefront of modern french stars  a status which with varying degrees of success they both still hold to this daybr br i have more of pialats films in my vhs to watch pile albeit all in french without english subtitles due to this fact but also loulous oppressive realism  in spite of its undeniable artistic merit  i cant say that im in any particular hurry to check them out now
6,pedantic overlong fabrication which attempts to chronicle the birth of the federal bureau of investigations begins quite promisingly with a stillrelevant probe into an airplane explosion however the melodrama involving james stewart and wife vera miles just gets in the way miles had a habit of playing tepid wives under duress and her frayed nerves arrive here right on schedule esteemed director mervyn leroy helmed this adaptation of don whiteheads book but despite the talent involved the picture fails to make much of an impression best performance is turned in by murray hamilton as stewarts partner however most of the dialogue is ludicrous and the dogged pacing causes the movie to seem twice as long as it is 12 from 
5,what could be more schlocky than the idea of private detectives getting involved with the women theyre supposed to be spying on and most of the dialogue as written is perfectly banalbr br but the actors turn the dialog into something that makes sense you can see real people behind the unreal lines and the directing is wonderful each scene does just what it has to and ends without dragging on too longbr br i showed this to several friends in the mid80s because i was perplexed at how such bad material could be made into such a good movie the friends enjoyed it too
7,br br i recently viewed this atrocity in my film program and i thought it was awful as i said in my tagline it was pretentious trite petty and phenomenally selfimportantbr br i consider myself a fan of film and all the things that film has to offer if i want to watch a documentary on the cannes festival i will watch aeand they would probably be alot more objective about itbr br i dont recommend it periodbr br 
0,normally i have much better things to do with my time than write reviews but i was so disappointed with this movie that i spent an hour registering with imdb just to get it off my chestbr br you would think a movie with names like morgan freeman or kevin spacey would be a bankable bet well this movie was just terrible it is nigh on impossible to suspend disbelief i tried really i wanted to enjoy it but justin timberlake just wouldnt let me br br timberlake should stick to music what a dreadful performance  no presence as an actorno character cant blame everything on justin the movie also boast a dreadful plot  badly timed editing its definitely an fbr br after seeing this i have to wonder what really motivates actors i mean surely morgan actually read the script before taking the part did he not see how poor it was what then could motivate him to take the part money of course acting is at times more about who you are seen with rather than really developing quality work br br ll cool j is a great actor he gets a lot more screen time than freeman or spacey in this movie and really struggles to come to terms with the poor script br br meanwhile the audience goes what the hell is going on here you expect me to believe this crapbr br in short apart from justin a great lineup badly executed  very disappointing
1,0510 this movie has absolutely nothing good about it the acting is among the worst i have ever seen what is really amazing is that everyone is awful not just a few here and there everyone the direction is a joke the low budget is hopelessly evident the score is awful i wouldnt say the movie was edited brutally chopped would be a more appropriate phrase it combines serial killings voodoo and tarot cards dumb dumb dumb it is not scary at all the special effects are hopelessly lame laughably bad throughout the writing was appallingly bad the cinematography is real cheap looking and very grainy sometimes and the camerawork is dreadful again what really does the movie in is how badly all the actors are cheesy
1,this was usually producer alexander kordas advice on set to many of his underlings the film is credited with three directors but in truth alex zoltan korda and william cameron menzies helped out pushing it to sixbr br for john kobals 1987 book the top 100 movies his survey of 81 film critics saw the thief of bagdad reach 55th place a closer examination reveals only jose luis guarner john russell taylor and kobal himself actually voted for the picture but their high placings were enough to take it to near the halfway markbr br the outbreak of the second world war saw the movies production shifted around england and america eventually seeing completion in 1940 and winning three technical oscars like citizen kane it is in some ways perhaps a film you might admire rather than lovebr br the special effects outstanding for the time are still reasonable and actually hold up if you squint but its not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions among them is an amusing horse constructed out of a kit model which when a key is inserted up its rear end begins to fly theres also a killer toy of the sixarmed goddess kali perhaps quite obviously a single woman with two women sitting behind her and a quite horrificlooking giant spider also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet but most memorable has to be rex ingram appearing as in a superb moment of cinematic conceit a djinn genie nearly a thousand feet tall ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature and adds an element of danger to the proceedings and look out for the moment where hes tricked back into his bottlebr br john justin does well as the arabic king who for some strange reason has an english accent and a stiff upper lip sabu the astonishingly muscled 15yearold is nearnamesake abu a likeably cocky thief after they cross paths with the evil jaffer conrad veidt justin finds himself blind and abu is turned into a dog when it seems the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind ahmeds justins perspective we find that halfway through the movie we catch up to the present and the adventure continues in truth the second half is someway the better being full of greater incident and more fantastical in naturebr br three small songs pepper the piece though as the film lasts for 100 minutes this feels more like mild flavouring rather than a real ingredient i wouldnt classify this as a musical its all great fun justin and june duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads veidt is the boohiss villain and abu is the youthful irrepressible robber it may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of 40s english movies but once youve sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in quite commendable
2,there is no denying that ealing comedies are good but for me this film stands out as one of the bestbr br the basic premise of the film is that a small part of pimlico in london is discovered to be part of burgundy not the uk we then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from uk law rationing does not exist when they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the systembr br they are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right in fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started thats where the moral comes in its when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender only to have the whole of london respond to their plight by sending food lots of it thus enabling them to continue their strugglebr br this film hits the right note throughout the acting is superb with stanley holloway margaret rutherford hermione baddeley and betty warren standing out its pitched just right not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat well worth a viewing
6,ive watched this movie a second time to try to figure out why it wasnt as successful commercially or artistically as it should have been and discovered considerable artistic meritwhich may ultimately have been its commercial undoingbr br first of all this movie attempts serious sciencefiction social commentary more than actionadventure there is action in it but thats not really what its about if you focus on that youll end up with as others have noted a bad aliens clone but again thats not what its aboutbr br the movie is really about todds kurt russell transformation from human to nearmachine and back to human mostly back but because its not trying to give you a typically glib hollywood style answer kurt russell must make this transformation without speaking and largely without broad expressions and he really does a wonderful jobit can take two viewings to appreciate itbr br the surrounding social logic is flawed and its never adequately explained whether todds ability to hold his own against an army of supposedly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or his newfound humanness or what but the movie still makes a marvellous showcase for russells easy to underestimate talent
6,a very interesting entertainment with the charm of the old movies tarzan faces the greatest perils without hesitation if the moment requires it and we all enjoy with him his successthe most insteresting for me is a man without special powers facing the problems and beating them just with human skills he was a great swimmer and had a great shout
0,this is the single worst movie i have ever seen i cannot express how bad it is i honestly wanted to kill myself several times through this atrocious experience just to have the pain end i recommend instead of seeing this movie you bathe in acid then you will at least know a fraction of the pain without all of the scarsbr br i had such high expectations when i read the back of the dvd case and when in the beginning it added that jesus was following them i was so excited then by the end i wanted to kill myself i mean a twentythree minute introduction to the most annoying characters in the history of cinema just pain monkeys could have done a better job editing this trash at least they would have thrown feces and blurred some of the garbage it would have made it better to have not seen any of the horrorbr br it wasnt that i didnt get the jokes its that they were not only not funny they repeated themselves like twenty times apparently something isnt funny unless you see it like a million timesbr br do not under any circumstances see this people have rated manos the hands of fate as the worlds worst movie i have seen that too and agree that it is bad but alas it is only the second worst fatty drives the bus is by far worsebr br this deserves all kind of harsh language but i cant write that here so just imagine i swore a whole bunch
7,to start with i have to point out the fact that youre gonna feel completely lost for more than half an hour yeah some things happen but you dont know why or what for when you finally figure things out you just realize that its nothing but a twisted soad opera dealing with mature prostitutes dead mothers illegitimate sons the characters are rather poor and the actors specially the young ones dont help that much to makeem look credible only marisa paredes stands out but shes a superb actress no matter if the movie is pure rubbishbr br the only positive things to say about fro sol de invierno is that dbutant pablo malo seems to have good intentions and hes filmed a couple of scenes that are quite intense well maybe the next timebr br my rate 410
5,i found the film quite expressive  the way the main character was lost but at the same much more clear about certain things in life than people who mocked him  his flatmate for example  br br he was tortured and you loved to watch him being tortured  it had this perverted side which was frightening but we were all happy to see him come out of the misery again br br it was like a game character or panman through a mineland or to enemy and we love to watch him under sniper attack or fire but then at the end we are happy to see him survive  br br 
6,there is a reason why this made for british tv movie only appeared at the 1977 toronto film festival it is dull plodding and lacking in suspensebr br peter otooles diffident performance and the appearance of playwright harold pinter are the only elements of interestbr br note  some british film fans will enjoy seeing philip jackson best known for his portrayal of inspector japp in the poirot television series in one of his earliest roles
6,when i first saw this movie i thought it was the typical love thy neighbour stuffthe more the movie was going on the more i got involved acting is magnificent from both actors direction was great the story unusual cried my eyes off first time in my life for a movie a real must have in any serious videoteque 11 out of 10
0,this was the worst movie i have ever seen billy zane in i understand that this movie was mainly to showcase the new comers who did pretty good for newbies but over all the movie was not believablebr br with all of the gunfire you would think the police would have intervened even the coin being a bug on sean was stupid the way sean suddenly realizes the coin is the bug was not realisticbr br looks like this movie was slapped together fast poor job get a better writerbr br the count down to the end was not in sync with anything it took longer to fight and what a coincidence that each time billy was going to blast sean hed be out of bullets once i can believe but not twice br br actually billys character was goofy it was so stupid when sean punches him out at the end it was like a comedy bad bad bad
6,although i had no earthly idea on what to expect from this movie this sure as hell wasnt what i would have had in mind had anything actually come to mind once i heard of its existence all i knew was that i had to own a movie called please dont eat the babies unfortunately i could only find a copy under its alternate title island fury looking back i guess i could call it a loselose situation on one hand i still dont get to be known as the guy who owns a movie called please dont eat the babies and on the other hand island fury would ultimately reveal itself to be an awful pointless boring unwatchable piece of garbage yeah definitely loselosebr br im not even sure what genre theyre going for here just early 80s badness with a flashback that might actually be longer than the nonflashback first up two teenage girls are being chased by two bad guys once caught the bad guys bring to our attention that one of the girls have a coin on a string around her neck and somehow these bad guys know of a lot more of these coins hidden on an island somewhere and this is where things start to get weird somehow these guys know of a trip the girls took to some island years earlier when they were only 10 i guess this is supposed to mean that the girls should know exactly where this alleged treasure is so now were in the past while the girls try to retrace their steps so these bad guys dont kill them although i wouldnt have minded if they had in the flashback the 10 year old counterparts are on a boat trip with their sisters and the sisters boyfriends eventually stopping by an island for some air they get mixed up with some kid and his killer grandparents any potential suspense or reasons to keep on watching never shows up but the flashback was undeniably better than the present which still isnt saying muchbr br for a while there i had forgotten about the original story at one point i ithought maybe the director had too and when the flashback ended that would be the end which would have worked for me considering this disappointment would have been a halfhour shorter this pointless movie within a pointless movie does eventually end and real stuff does happen but its stupid i guess i didnt exactly expect a movie filled with infants being devoured or anything like that but i did expect some form of outlandish bentertainment mostly just a confusing inept storyline unsure of its genre my advice would be to seek out something worthwhile like attack of the beast creatures if anyone i would only recommend this one to serious bmovie collectors who must have them all anyone else interested probably has brain damage what really gets me is that i still have no idea why they called it please dont eat the babies 310
2,giant is one of the most boring overlylong hollywood contraptions ever many scenes seem utterly fake and without energy rock hudson elizabeth taylor and james dean are wasted in this big hollywood production a central notion to this movie that a rancher would ever resist drilling for oil on his land is absurd and i know this because im from houston a couple of scenes especially dean serving taylor coffee redeem this otherwise boring film for a much more accurate and interesting depiction about how modernism changed the ranches in texas see hud one of paul newmans great performances or the last picture show
2,not long enough to be feature length and not abrupt enough to a short this thing exists for one reason to have a lesbian threeway there are worse reasons to exist one sad thing is that this could have made a decent feature length movie misty fits snuggly into her outfit and is a very cocky girl and when people are so infatuated with a game character like lara croft that they make nude calenders of her you know that a softcore flick is set to explode unfortunately this is pretty pathetic especially the painfully fake sex scene between darian and misty where you can see her hand is fingering air watch this if you just cant get enough of misty or ruby who makes a nice blonde and has zee verst jerman akcent ever
4,this is listed as a documentary its not its filmed sort of like a documentary but that i suspect was just because then they get away with a shaky camera and dodgy filming this has just been released in the uk on dvd as an american pie style comedy its not that eitherbr br basically it follows around a group of teens on spring break as they go to mexico for cheap booze and with the quest being to get there virgin friend finally laid throw is a couple of dwarfs also on the same sort of quest and you have a nonhilarious tale of drunk teens trying to get some girlsbr br considering the 18 rating this has very little nudity and practically zero sex scenes mainly i guess the rating is for swearing of which there is plentybr br if you like crude jackass behaviour without the humour then this may be your thing if you have any brain cells left then i would probably avoid this
0,this 1919 to 1933 germany looks hardly like a post wwii czech capitol oh sorry it is the czech capitol and it is 2003 how funnybr br this is one of the most awful history movies in the nearest past rhm is a head higher than adolf and looks so damned good gring looks like 40 when he just is 23 and the fhrer always seems to look like 56 and the buildings folks even buildings have been young sometimes especially 1919 were a lot of houses in germany nearly new the wwi does not reach german cities no crumbling plaster then the reichstagsbuilding there have never been urban canyons around this building never and this may sound to you all like a miracle in the year 1933 the greater berlin fire brigade owns a lot of vehicles with engines some even with turntable ladders but none with a hand pumpbr br one last thing what kind of playmobil castle was this at the final sequence for me this was a kind of adolfs adventures in wonderland
7,there are few films or movies i consider favorites over the years the gospel road was one of them i watched this as a young teen and would like the opportunity to watch it again my favorite parts were the fact that br br 1jesus was blond br br 2the last supper was a huge mealbr br he liked playing with the childrenbr br 4his death was for all people and for all timebr br the movie may not have been theologically sound or high quality acting but it touched my heart at that time besides i am a johnny cash fan and it was a brave venture if it ever comes out on dvd i will purchase it purely for sentimental reasons
0,i went to see antone fisher not knowing what to expect and was most pleasantly surprised the acting job by derek luke was outstanding and the story line was excellent of course denzel washington did his usual fine job of acting as well as directing it makes you realized that people with mental problems can be helped and this movie is a perfect example of this dont miss this one
2,may contain spoilersbr br the titular topless heroine rescues another beautiful babe and her father an eccentric professor whose stock pith helmet is broken in one shot and whole in the next from a motheaten dimestore mummy and nasty nazis out towhat elsebuild a fourth reich mistys costume like those of some other wimmen gets skimpier as the movie rolls on the last portion of the movie is devoted to protracted lesbian action this footage actually gets real boring real fast which says more about the critters behind the camera than the curvaceous creatures in front of it misty gets its nominal plot out of the way first and fast then gives undivided attention to nudity and softcore sex this makes mummy raider a throwback to movies made in the 1960s by guys like stan borden david f friedman and harry novak just think if this wonderwork had been cranked out four decades ago it would have played for years on 42nd street along with wham bam thank you spaceman and kiss me quick as it is misty mundae mummy raider went straight to home video grab yours quick before it goes out of print
4,miraculously this is actually quite watchable i mean its bad its really bad but whereas the original was sobaditsruiningmylife bad this is sobaditsmildlyentertaining bad right thats enough faint praise production values are rotten across the board the acting is excruciating and the romerowannabe satire cant make its mind up which side of the ecology fence its mocking internal logic takes a back seat to heads propelling themselves out of fridges virus incubation times fluctuating as the plot requires bullets working against the zombies or not zombies having the power of speech or not gore is the draw obviously but the framework is so slapdash its annoying the dialogue sounds like its been translated by the same computers that mangle instruction manuals and the scale of the zombie infestation is implied with none of the ingenuity of romeros films its all topped off with a horrendous synth score absolute rubbish
5,this is almost typical lynch however what makes this film slightly unusual for lynch is the fact that it looks very raw almost amateurish but i believe lynch does this on purpose to give a greater sense of realism which serves to increase the intensity of surreal momentsbr br however a lot of typical lynch motifs are present such as floating camera work haunting music long excruciating pauses hanging curtains dim lights growing darker at a slow almost indiscernible pace extreme close ups themes of women in trouble overbearing incompassionate all knowing characters facing off with characters who are distraught temporarily oblivious in the dark and so onbr br the performances are great and the short is thought provoking as usual lynch leaves almost everything up to interpretation many questions are left unanswered and this ignites the imaginationbr br another brilliant effort from lynch i only hope he makes some shorts more along the lines of his sony playstation commercials they were inspired
6,i saw dick tracy when i was very young i didnt know who any of the actors were and i didnt know the movie would turn out different than the way it was previewed i sure loved it thoughbr br warren beatty stars as the crimefighting 1930s detective dick tracy who goes after the biggest mob bosses in the city this time big boy caprice al pacino has killed a very powerful man and is out to take over the city with his singer girlfriend breathless mahoney madonna who has her eye on tracy it becomes even worse because a new criminal is invading and the worst part is this criminal has no face he or she is very unknown plus the famous villians are back from the comic book collectionbr br i thought that this movie was very colorful and creative it was entertaining and fun to watch especially as a child warren beaty was just like james bond of the 1930s the way he played dick tracybr br an ensemble cast of the film includes charlie korsmo glenn headly william forsythe dustin hoffman james caan ed o ross tommy lee jones mandy patinkin charles durning plus morebr br dick tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie for a family to enjoy take my word for it
1,this movie was made in 1948 but it still rings true today very very funny it begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it builds from there anyone who has ever built a house will find this movie very endearing great cast cary grant and myrna lloyd are delightful in this film this is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the 40sclothing architecture and family life many references are made to the cost of things and those comparisons to todays costs are pretty amazing i cant imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely i am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it a true classic
0,sure this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clichs but its entertaining and thats what i watch movies for to be entertained natasha henstridge is stunning even with the short hair her smile is radiant and her beauty cant be disguised as for michael vartan im sure the women love him the two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film i dont understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them i guess we see what we want to seebr br olivia dabo and michael rigoli were fun to watch even if dabos british accent did creep into her supposed bronx speech to tell you the truth i hadnt really noticed it until i read these comments but i went back to the dvd and now her dialogue sounds more british than american to me but she was ideal for her role with that one exception br br its a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others but who find their soul mates in one another it may be an unlikely story but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries it is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube thats why we watch them to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen i thought these actors did a good job of it but hey im a sentimental guy who tears up easily dont get me wrong though it has to be a sentimental scene and this movie had plenty of thosebr br i give it 910 only because im saving my 1010 for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that i know will come along some day if you see it advertised as coming up on the movie channel or lifetime movies or whatever make a note to watch it i think youll like it
6,narratives  whether written visual or poetic epics  generally try to avoid too may characters readers and viewers after all can be too easily overwhelmed by trying to keep track of who exactly is who this is especially true in film i think simply because we cannot easily go back to refresh our memory in a cinema viewers like myself however dont have that problem because we see all our films on dvd or vhsbr br a year ago i was introduced to audrey tautou a french actress whom i first saw in the fabulous destiny of amelie poulain 2001 and later in a very long engagement 2004 both of which were finely crafted and complex stories with a large cast of characters this earlier offering exceeds the others in both ways more characters and more complexitybr br now other directors have used those techniques before robert altman with the player 1992 short cuts 1993 gosford park 2001 and others paul thomas anderson did the same with magnolia 1999 stanley kramer did it with a mad mad mad mad world in 1963 a comedy of almost epic proportions the difference with this film is first the director lets us see inside the head of some of the characters and second some scenes are repeated as means to refresh the viewers memory as the story flipflops between different time periodsbr br the basic  the core so to speak  story concerns a young woman irene tautou who is told by a fellow commuter on a train that she will meet her true love on that day this occurs in the first few minutes of the film the clever irony at this point is that irene doesnt realize that the young man opposite gilbert robin may be that one true love and nor does hebr br they go their separate ways with neither realizing the potential significance of their close encounter however chaos results throughout the rest of the day not only for the two young people but for the rest of the characters who appear in a series of cleverly constructed and interwoven vignettes that all seem to be going nowhere and yetbr br if the story were simply that it could tend to be boring and even quite predictable not so the script and the director rip into our expectations with a host of innovative scenes that are all too commonplace but which are turned into believable extraordinary events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again for example the next time some bird poo from the sky drops onto a book or paper of yours consider your alternatives two characters make an obvious choice that must occur before irene and her man of destiny meet again or what about a stone chip flying onto your windscreen consider again what would happenbr br all of that is interesting enough what was more interesting for me was assessing each new man who came along and trying to decide whether this guy was the one for irene or whether it was in fact the young man on the train that kept me guessing for a whilebr br ill let you think about that should you see this delightful rompbr br recommended for all
0,honestly i am not even joking when i say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen this film dosent have a single ounce of originality in its flimsy dialog or its blatantly plagiarized story line i can not even begin to count the number of things in this film that are obviously ripped off from the omen and other movies like it for example the nanny lucy in this film is actually one of the devils minions sent to guide and protect the spawn of satandoes this sound a lot like mrs baylock to anyone else another thing is that the orphanage were they first got the child burned to the ground just a few months after he was adopted just like in the omen however luckily one priest survived the blaze and escaped with sever burns all over his bodyyet another coincidence and to top it all off the burned priest is staying in a hospital room with pictures of jesus all over the walls much like the priest in the omen having pages of the bible plastered on the walls like wallpaper please dont even get me started drawing comparisons between the ending of this movie and the omen for you because as ive stated above there are far too many to mention here
5,ill say one thing for jeanette and nelsoneven when stranded in a mirthless witless painfully inept musical like this theres still that twinkle in their eyes yes the chemistry between the famous duo is there even when the material is paper thin even when the score is practically a throwaway nonexistent one depending on just a couple of catchy tunes and even when the circumstances are so unbelievableyes even for a fantasybr br truth to tell she has more chemistry with nelson than with her own reallife husband gene raymond in smilin through which nonetheless was a considerably better filmbr br sorry i love jeanette and nelson as much as the next fan but this is the bottom of the heap jeanette is more than embarrassing in her one hep number with binnie barnesand nelson can only come up with a blank stare when faced with the most ludicrous situationsbr br one can only wonder what this was like on broadway in 1938 surely it must have had more wit and style than is evident in this weak mgm production edward everett horton fizzles in an unfunny role and none of the supporting players can breathe any semblance of life into this mess its like amateur night at the studio even with the few professionals sprinkled among the supporting castbr br summing up painfully clumsy rendering of a rodgers and hart musical cant recommend it even for fans of macdonald and eddy and even if jeanettes closeups still glow with her gossamer beauty this film is jawdroppingly bad
0,this movie starts out with a certain amount of promise but in my view begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down that this wellmeaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is away making a phone call is implausible enough but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his familys life back on track is the type of coincidence beginning writers are warned against using in their storiesbr br i found this movie average at best art direction could have been much better as could have been cinematography the acting was good and so was eva van der guchts singing
7,a riotous farce set in the world of glamorous daytime soap operas this film is hilarious admittedly you have to have a taste for films with screaming hysterical dialogue overthetop acting and melodramatic plot twists but if you do youre in for one hell of a treatbr br sally field plays celeste talbert daytime tvs queen of misery celestes cushy life is thrown into upheaval with the unexpected arrival of lori craven elisabeth shue her longlost niece and simultaneously jeffrey anderson kevin kline  splendid as always celestes longago lover but celeste has been hiding a deep dark secret and the arrival of lori and jeffrey might just bring it to the surface add in the diabolical montana moorehead a wonderful cathy moriarty in full gorgeous woman with testosterone to spare mode who is trying mighty hard to destroy celestes career david robert downey jr the weenieboy producer of the soap whos secretly plotting with montana to ruin celeste and rose schwarz whoopi goldberg scriptwriter and celestes one true confidant and you are in for a heaping helping of subplots and general chaosbr br chaotic comedies like this are tricky to execute does anyone remember mixed nuts but when done well can be pretty damn funny a major ingredient that is necessary to any good comedy is the casting of seasoned pros who know that lots of times the funniest things are not said but seen in an expression or a look field kline goldberg and the rest all work together so well and are clearly having a great time that it is hard not to become drawn in by their energy and enthusiasm shue is clearly the weakest link here but she only draws attention to herself because she is surrounded by field kline et al moriarty is a standout in the showy villainess role making you think of the hottest damn dominatrix you ever did see there are also lots of familiar faces that youll recognize in small but nevertheless all very funny roles including carrie fisher garry marshall kathy najimy and teri hatcher director michael hoffman keeps the pace swift and the histrionic plot moving toward the big finish mention must also be made of robert harlings screenplay carefully constructed to stage a soap opera within a soap opera the dialogue is boiling over with great lines delivered brilliantly by the actors id be willing to bet that a lot of this stuff was improvisedbr br look if you want to see a bunch of pros doing what they do best and having a great time doing it get your hands on this one if not for anything else it will put you in a good mood and make you laugh
1,felt mine was while watching thisbut it seems that is the reason for insanity running in the family in this film not that makes a lot of sense anyway as others have mentioned this was one of karloffs last films and its only his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all its sad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in low grade rubbish like this marginally boris did get off slightly better than poor old bela lugosi but not by much br br boris does his best and give him credit for trying to hold this mess together the strident background music doesnt help and distracts from any lucid moment apart from boris the rest of the mexican cast are dubbed into some strange clipped english monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies br br at a guess i think its edgar allen poes house of usher that this is taken from but youd be hard pressed to find a great deal of poe in the finished articlebr br still there are far better films out there with boris karloff at his best search them out and give this a wide berth unless you want the curse of the shrinking brain too
5,this film has to be viewed in the right frame of mind first the central fatherson relationship makes it pretty clear that the film was intended as a prequel to his wong fei hung film drunken master ideas from this film recur in drunken master ii and not young master that chan backed away from this plan and renamed the characters indicates that he himself was not convinced the material was coming together properly and indeed the film conveys a sense of being incomplete for instance the romantic relationship around which half the plot turns is left utterly hanging at the end of the film young master from the same period also feels underdone but at least all its central threads are tied together at the end this film feels as though chan wrestled with the plot and characters trying to find his central theme only to abandon the effort possibly due to time and budgetbr br or perhaps the film is simply overambitious this is an important turning point film in chans career because he commits himself to development of the central character above all other concerns  which is why theres such a lack of kung fu throughout the film chan wants to make an historical romantic comedy that just happens to have kung fu in it but both the historical element and the romantic element come across as little more than plottwistsbr br that leaves us with the comedy since chans concern is characterdevelopment the comedy is largely character driven  as in the conflict between chans character and his best friend an argument over a girl but theres plenty of slapstick as well frankly i find the comedy amusing enough to forgive the incompleteness of the plotbr br this film represents an effort on chans part to find a viable formula that he can use and develop over time it doesnt quite work and chan would only find that formula after abandoning the historical elements of his earlier films with the making of the contemporary action comedy police story but going back to view this film is still very informative as to how chan worked his way through the historical genre and perhaps why he abandoned it
2,grey gardens1975 is the maysles brothers bizarre documentary of jackie bouvier kennedy onassiseccentric aunt and first cousin who live like pigs in a run down 28 room mansion on east hampton long islandbig edie bouvier beale78witty and dry and her daughter little edie beale56emotionally about 13 a still beautiful woman who once had a promising futurelive in isolation from the rest of the world except for their many cats and raccoons in the attic they amuse themselves by bickering all day listening to the radio or singing to each otherthey dont even own a television their fall from society is amazing to learn of and the viewer is drawn to these two very special although obviously dysfunctional peopleone of the better documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today
5,i really looked forward to see planet of the apes but it was a huge dissapointmentbr br the settings and masks are great but that is the only good aspect of the film all other things are really annoying mark wahlberg is not acting he is just in the movie looking stupid the other actors are also not very goodbr br but the worst point of all is the story it is absolutely ridiculous for example the apes are lying unconsiousness on the ground but the humans dont attack them no they wait until they are up again this is just one example for the stupid story but it would take too long to tell them all
6,unashamedly ambitious scifi from kerry conran for whom this is clearly a labour of love unfortunately its just not that good it all starts well enough  with an epic but restrained score a mixture of lucas and hitchcock style editing and the glossy cinematography of a spielberg the movie also references many pulp scifi novels serials and films as diverse as the day the earth stood still superman metropolis planet of the apes the iron giant star wars and the spy who loved me the film however fails to be as good as any one of those for several reasons the main being that its such a labour of love so concerned with throwing everything at the screen and creating a brave new world conran actually forgets about making a movie there is little to no tension atmosphere or magic on offer here despite aerial battles dinosaurs and raceagainsttime setpieces even the noir elements fall flat this is a broad way of looking at things though  those elements mainly fail because nothing feels at all real and is so obviously fake  the greenscreen just looks like a video game half the time and its obvious the actors have been pasted on afterwards the actors dont get to do much either  jude law is wooden gwyneth paltrow is annoying and stupid angelina jolie is wasted  and its all because of an awful script  the sort that has to explain nearly everything it is a decent experience and some might get a nostalgia feel but ultimately this is a pointless step into the world of yesterday nice ending though
2,ernst lubitschs contribution to the american cinema is enormous his legacy is an outstanding group of movies that will live forever as is the case with the shop around the corner this film has been remade into other less distinguished movies and a musical play without the charm or elegance of mr lubitschs own and definite versionbr br margaret sullavan and james stewart worked in several films together their characters in this movie stand out as an example of how to be in a movie without almost appearing to be acting at all both stars are delightful as the pen pals that dont know of one another but who fate had them working together in the same shop in budapestbr br the reason why these classic films worked so well is the amazing supporting casts the studios put together in picture after picture in here we have the wonderful frank morgan playing the owner of the shop also we see joseph schildkraut felix bressart william tracy and charles smith among others doing impressive work in making us believe that yes they are in budapestbr br that is why these films will live forever
0,i was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week my 13 year old son was looking forward to it too i rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screenbr br boy was i disappointed this movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable george c scott is an excellent actor but in this it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20 of the time the rest of the time he was quite flatbr br i realize that this was made in 84 precg effects for the most part but it looked to be very bmovie quality especially the encounter with jacob marleybr br the biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story when the spirit of christmas present takes scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of christmastimebr br i will admit that mr scott did a good job with the reformed scrooge at the end that was a refreshing portrayalbr br i wish that bob cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and downtrodden and tiny tim oh dont even get me started on bad child actors
4,whatever his name is the writer and director should be locked away in hopes garbage like this is never made again this one is in a battle with some of the most awful movies of all time sometimes movies are bad in a way that theyre actually sort of good not this one this was so bad i got angry seriously a drunken 10 year old could have come up with a better script what a waste all the actors were completely uninspired to work at all the cgi was barely acceptable the sequences of scenes were completely retarded and hurt the little bit of story there was its like he just decided i want this to happen and this to happen but i dont care how we got there just shoot it and put it in whatever im going back to my trailer to pick my nose if anyone calls for me im not here shame on you whatever your name is shame on you
0,well not actually this movie is very entertaining though went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the i think there might be something in my eye routine the movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance jim carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides in fact all the characters are great the movie is not overly funny or sappy good flick to go see with the wifebr br all in all 810note  i am not an easy grader thats all from bigv over and out
1,how many of us wish that we could throw away social and cultural obligations and be free most of us i suspect shall we dance is not a movie about dancing it is about learning about ourselves recognising what we are looking for in life and having the courage to go in search of it mr sugiyama is a middleaged member of a japanese society where ballroom dancing is viewed as unsuitable behaviour br br one day mr sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning out of the window of a dancing acadamy he is fascinated by her and eventually signs up for dancing lessons he is ashamed of his dancing and afraid of ridicule he hides the fact that he is attending dancing classes from his colleagues and familybr br there is a hilarious scene in the mensroom at the office when sugiyama and watanabe a workmate who also dances are interrupted practising some dance steps there are many other funny and warmhearted scenesbr br the ending is not a fairytale but it leaves the viewer feeling goodbr br this movie helped me to understand the japanese people a little better it is a warm and very worthwhile film to see
2,the only time i have seen this movie was when i was 10 years old i have remembered it all of these years as i couldnt sleep for a week or more after seeing it it just absolutely rattled me i was on vacation with my aunts in ft worth texas and i will never forget it now 48 years later my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me to view as an adult it has taken a lot of research to find out what movie it was but i always remembered that barbara stanwyck was in it and finally was able to get the name and reviews on it i very much enjoyed it but it gave me quite a scare jaqui
1,barriers seems to be one of those series that have been lost in the mists of time after its transmission in the early 80s and one repeat its since sunk without trace this is a crying shamebr br i originally watched this when it was transmitted in the southern tv region on sunday afternoons and was classic teatime viewing although i dont remember a great deal about the program a few things stuck in my mind most notable were the unforgettable titles the mournful flute music accompanying the attempted escape across an east european border and the subsequent car crash and that scene has left me with an abiding love of fintail mercedes models as they used a merc 200 although it wasnt obvious at the start the solution to the series mystery was in these titlesbr br the plot about a young music student trying to unravel what really happened when he discovers he was adopted had lots of twists and turns but barriers was a surprisingly adult childrens drama benedict taylor was excellent as billy and it was a shame he didnt do a lot morebr br this was a quality drama well overdue for a dvd release and i hope ill get the chance to reacquaint myself with it in the futurebr br a fond memory from my childhood
7,this movie deserved a working over on mystery science theater even though it has nothing whatever to do with king solomon its worth a watch because it is an unintentional laughriot really its worse than destroy all monsters be sure to check out the following the cheesy medallion looks like the shriners have been here the obviously polyester norfolk jacket on allan quatermain david macallums badly done stutter which does draw attention away from his even worse acting the incredibly bad process work on all the monsters the monsters themselves  the hand puppet which menaces the little girl the giant snake that menaces macallum while he sinks in oatmeal the redlighted eyes on the motorized crabs the amazingly hilarious boat oh brother which appears to be made of plywood mounted on an old sand dredge and looks like a leftover from a jrsr prom voyage into the future with the class of 71 the phoenician city  where they wear roman imperial armor but which inexplicably has egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions the phoenicians invented the alphabetcome onand worst of all macallum and ekland with her fright wig playing smoochyface oh the horror the best parts are that the intrepid explorers manage to lose the comic frenchman and the african guy snuffleupagus or whatever  evidently chose to die heroically rather than be in any more scenes
2,this film was pure pain sitting in the theater for xamount of minutes i was wondering when the film was going to start all the setups were in place typical love story characters have to overcome their shortgivings villain has to emerge but none of it ever initiated by the time these things happened i was already bored stiff and the devices were completely ineffective in scenes that required immense tension and buildup it felt like necessary frames were cut kids stuff does not have to be this way childrens films can be as riveting and engaging as adult ones the excuse hey  its for kids is bull ill take sword in the stone any day this was terrible im getting the feeling that disney will put out anything these days and as for the kids the 10year i saw this with will agreepure trash
2,ed harriss work in this film is up to his usual standard of excellence that is he steals the screen away from anyone with whom he shares it and that includes the formidable sean connery the movie which is more than a bit sanctimonious comes alive only in the scenes when harris is interrogated by the attorney for another convict it is breathtaking a master class in artistic controlbr br the other cast members are all adept and connery is reliable as is fishbourne but the story itself packs no wallop the plot depends largely on the premise that a black prisoner always will be mistreated and coerced by white law enforcement officers this is the engine which drives the story right or wrong and makes one feel a tad cheated at the endbr br still worth watching to see harris in action
5,i was true to my regard for mr glover and ms goldberg i watched the entire film with my family and some friends i have no idea what the movie was about after much discussion we all agreed that this was not one of their better effortsbr br it doesnt hang together very well it is too choppy and there is little comedy i am disappointed it could have been much betterbr br i waited months to see this film based on the liner notesbr br dont waste your money unless you are a completist and just want to see all of mr glovers and ms goldbergs filmsbr br it was a poor way to spend an evening
6,saving grace is a feel good movie with its heart in the right place grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts she could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana shes living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors theres only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on its user its obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff the way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny its precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by english slapstick and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable
2,dont get me wrong dan jansen was a great speed skater if there was one guy who deserved his gold medal at the olympics it was danbr br but how can it be possible that bill corcoran has made such a bad movie about the incredible dan jansen story because the real dan jansen story is truly incredible especially when you look at this movie through the eyes of a sportsman everything is wrong the way matt keeslar and the other actors skate their technique the dimensions of the speedskating oval it is all wrongbr br shame on you bill corcoran dan jansen deserves better a lot betterbr br out of 10
5,conventional wisdom is that a sequel is seldom as good as the original movie there are occasional exceptions but this is not one of them disney should have quit while they were ahead this was a real disappointment after a reasonably entertaining 101 dalmatians
1,well on the endless quest for horror we will come across this film apparently rereleased on dvd recently for some ungodly reason the transfer is awful and the quality just sucks i dont think this is due to a bad remaster or anything i just think the film is poorly donebr br obviously filmed at an abandoned school with a budget that was no doubt wasted on cheap beer and no talent hacks slaughter high starts out slow and doesnt pick up pace until about an hour in first we get to see a nerd as he is picked on by a group ofi actually dont even know what they were supposed to bejocks the ringleader with his ultra hooknose is so ugly he should have definitely been cast as the nerd then there is a big guy and a couple of dumb losers and chicks who are supposed to be hot but arent its a mystery why this group of rejects is picking on one of their own but i guess the viewer is to assume these are cool kids picking on a dweeb the casting choices are horrendous as most of the high schoolers are played by thirtysomethings as other reviewers on here have pointed out the actors if you can call them that are a bunch of brits whose accents slip out numerous times throughout this piece of crap we are left to assume that this group of children were the only students at this school as their reunion is only them at the school which is now shown to be abandoned is just thembr br the kills are lame the gore is not great and the script is like scooby doo with real people lines like this place gives me the creeps and someone gimme a beer are highlightsits just not good skip this one unless you are getting wasted with some friends and wanna laugh at a real lame attempt at a slasher if you wanna see good get bavas bay of blood done 14 years earlier and a heck of a lot better if you wanna see a good bad slasher see just before dawn or the burning out of 10 kids
1,well what can one say firstly this adaptation is far too long at hours for the complexity or lack of such of the plot the actors try really hard to make something of this film but there is too little content for the time available swayzee is really not a quatermain character at all after seeing sean connerys interpretation of the great man in the league of extraordinary gentlemen swayzee really does not make the grade this chap with the winchester repeating rifle has none of the strength stature subtlety or humour needed for the part and is upstaged by everyone including the witch doctor who incidentally seems from my point of view to be more convincing as an actor than the rest of the cast some of the vistas are pleasing but there are silly mistakes in the cinematography for example when the happy team arrive at the water hole in the middle of the desert their tracks are visible down to the oasis just waiting for them to walk in them climbing out of the mine leads to an exit on the next shot nothing like the exit seen from the passage they have climbed through et cetera i was waiting for doug mcclure to appear at any moment in some ways i wish he had br br the leader of the russians pursuing quatermain is a shoddily created stereotypical character who just shoots at everything br br swayzee does quite well as the sad father returned to london who is unable to obtain the custody of his son swayzee should stick to that sort of thing he is not able to carry the part of a courageous gentleman with a stout heart experience of life and sense of fair playbr br out of 10 barely
5,if you have never viewed this film and like old time veteran actors this is the film for you seeing frank sinatra when he was very young and extremely thin with sunken in cheeks and a wonderful voice which sang some great old songs michele morgan millie pico gave an outstanding performance with plenty of dance and musical numbers leon errol cyrus drake gave a great supporting role along with victor borge sir victor fitzroy victor who performed classical piano and no slap stick comedy like he did in his career this is not a great musical but frank sinatra was a great joy to see at the beginning of his career in the 1940s
7,a very weak movie mainly because of a poor story but also poor acting in the case of robert downey jr and irrational behaviour by many of the characters if you are someone who likes to switch your mind off and simply watch a movie for its creativity or acting criteria then you may like this movie personally i cant do that with a drama and found this too farfetchedbr br im particularly annoyed when a main character that is supposed to be an intelligent person continually acts like a complete imbecile in this movie if the main character acted the way a person would normally act in these situations there would be no moviebr br the first highly unlikely act is when the main character a successful attorney named magruder played by kenneth branagh is leaving a party and happens upon a girl mallory doss played by embeth davidtz who is screaming that her car has been stolen they are standing around in a tropical rainstorm as he badgers her into accepting a ride homebr br she tells him about her weird father who belongs to some kind of weird sect and does crazy things when they arrive at her dilapidated shack in the poorer part of town they notice that her car is in the driveway also the house lights are on and some objects in the house have been brokenbr br things are very odd shes weird looking like a tramp she undresses in front of him until shes completely naked  oh yeah also the fathers strange the house is a wreck  everything should have told magruder hey this is too weird for me im out of here but not magruder he sleeps with her and then motivated by her story and sex takes up the case of trying to have her father committed it all screams setupbr br then being the topflight attorney that he is he arrives late at the office wearing the same shirt he had on the night before a fact that all of the women in the office notice is it likely that a successful attorney would act like a 16yearold magruder has upset the police in some of his cases so when he goes to the police claiming with ample evidence that the father is terrorising them the police ignore him i could have believed begrudging assistance but no help at all  not likelybr br its just too unlikely
0,i watched this movie after seeing it on broadway i love the broadway musical and i love the movie i watched the movie like it was not related to the broadway show i am an avid reader and have seen what happens to most books when they are turned into movies so i developed a philosophy really early assume that the movie is going to be based on the book  or musical in this case but that while the story line may be similar it will not be the same it will be different so watch it for what it isbr br i danced for 12 years before i had to make a choice i was a good dancer picking up chorus work in local productions as a child etc but i wasnt super talentedi was however super talented as a show rider i was told by my dance instructor and my trainer  who i spent several months a year at his farm out of state that i had to make a choice when i turned 14 that i needed to move up from dancing two hours fourfive days a week and riding hours a day days a week and dedicate to one or the other so i dearly love dancing and i love this movie and a lot of the other ballet and dance movies i just chose to watch this movie for what it is it is a great movie about raw emotion and human interaction it is about the power of anticipation and heartbreak when you work really hard to get something you want and you just do not get it i love the movie i love the broadway musical
6,im not sure it was the language or the poor acting but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and fakebr br after seeing der untergang this is a huge disappointment theres no connection between different scenes and the acting is so incredibly poor i couldnt even believe people could make such a mess of something that had great potentialbr br and above all everyone in germany speaks english big mistake the german language has a certain sound to it and especially hitler himself only sounds like hitler when hes speakingyelling germanbr br the way the story is told made me believe it was improvised on the spot the characters were empty and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that could have happenedbr br whether its the english or the fact that ive already seen der untergang everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous
0,i thought this was an awesome movie the theme song is sweet  anyway the only thing that somewhat bothered me was in the beginning when everything should have been normal it was very weird and unrealistic the big cable company is mainly what im talking about apart from that the movie was very creative i think that all the acting was well done the actors acted out their characters personalities perfectly everything fit together well it really is a shame that their isnt a soundtrack that would have been great because this is a canadian film and because it is one of my favorites i give this movie a 10 out of 10
5,when i think of the cheesiest guilty pleasuretype movies the first thing i think of are 80s slasher flicks really bad slasher flicks the formulaic type of film where all a script needed was parts blood and several parts nudity to get madebr br flash forward to the late 90searly 00s the slasher flick has been revitalized with the success of 1996s scream like in the 80s these films were formulaic masking a lack of inspiration by labelling themselves as hip tongueincheek parodies of the original slasher flicks of this recent blend of hip parody neoslasher flicks the only one worth seeing is the lowbudget directtovideo cutbr br like most of the other new slasher flicks cut relies on the production of a slasher flick in this case a fictional 1985 film hot blooded to make its commentary on the genre hot blooded never finished production because of killings by someone wearing the mask of the films killer scarman a bald figure with its mouth stitched close and dark pupilless eyes now 12 years later a group of film students whose professor was involved in the production have decided to go into the vaults tap the original surviving actress and finish the film but every time the film is screened or a scene is shot scarman returns and someone dies to quote the tagline will they finish the film before it finishes thembr br this all sounds really bad and to a degree it is really is there such a thing as a good slasher flick there is no character development the new director is revealed to be the daughter of hot bloodeds original director whose life was apparently ruined after the production was cancelled this wouldve been a perfect detail to be worked into the plot yet its never mentioned again and like in all other slasher flicks there are just too many bodies to care about the actors arent great even by directtovideo standards but most are having fun with their characters and for those who arent its inadvertent character acting since none of their characters in the film wanted to work on hot blooded particularly whoever was lucky enough to play scarman cuts climax has no big who dunnit unmasking of the killer like in the scream films it doesnt have the gimmick killings of the urban legend films what it does have is an original and interesting concept that is diluted by a this way we can write a sequel if it sells well ending but thats par for the coursebr br by any sensible viewing standards this is a horrible movie that should be avoided but this quality is what makes it true to its roots in the slasher genre and this is what makes it more enjoyable than any of the other neoslasher flicks
6,what a disappointmentbr br this film seemed to be trying to copy cutting edge comedy but the direction and the script was sloppy sickly and sentimental in the worst film tradition jack blacks actingrole was selfindulgent and selfregarding and the other characters were equally unmasking and uninteresting the soundtrack was tedious we are  were fans of black but none of us did more than mange a forced titter for the duration why did he feel he needed to make this mistakebr br we will not watch another of his films without reading reviews more carefully firstbr br was he drunk when he read the script before signing up for this drivel
1,viscontis first feature ossessione is an adaptation of james m cains the postman always rings twice now im not familiar with that book or the other film versions but i am a big fan of cains double indemnity much more so than i am a fan of billy wilders film version of it in fact the two novellas seem like they must be very similar both involve an illicit love affair where a ravenous wife complains to a morally weak man that her husband is worthless and mean to her giovanna the woman in this italian version played very well by clara calamai is not evil incarnate like the wife in double indemnity but she seems very spoiled her husband a great performance by juan de landa is a bit cruel to her but she strikes me like she is at least as uncompromising with him hes older than her and unattractive so shes rather fickle when gino shows up a young muscular man it takes her about five minutes to get him into bed she sweats she wants to be with him forever but shes stuck with her husband they break up at first but when they meet again they apparently although this is intentionally vague plan to murder the husband they are successful and they move back to the womans home town to run the bar that her husband owned gino is very unenthusiastic about this idea he wants giovanna but the one thing that he certainly doesnt want is to sit around in one place for the rest of his life their relationship quickly crumbles ossessione is a very complex film with complex characters its always fascinating but it does go on a bit too long at two hours and twentytwo minutes i cant for the life of me figure out how it took that long this is partly due to the neorealist stylistics that visconti was inventing within this film it was after all the first film that won that label we see a lot of the action prolonged as it would be in real life without any hurrying to the next plot point ive seen many of viscontis films and the only one i like better than this one is rocco and his brothers 1960 his direction is as great as it ever was with the camera moving brilliantly and the editing perfect i also feel the need to point out the films best performance by dhia christiani as a young exotic dancer and parttime prostitute named anita whom gino meets after he begins to try to break away from giovanna shes only in the film for maybe five or six minutes and she has only a few lines its shocking how much visconti and christiani are able to do with this character in such a short time shes absolutely heartbreaking 910
0,ive seen better teenage werewolf movies in my time this one however takes the cake more comedy than horror full moon high puts the c in cheesefest the star quality in this movie is not bad just the way it was made just sends in rolling downhill adam arkin plays tony an allamerican high school football player of the 50s who ends up not aging due to a werewolf bite in transylvania the most annoying part of the movie was the violin player he drove everyone batty ed mcmahon plays his ultraconservative father who met his end of his own bullet adams father alan plays a shrink who seems to be not top of his game after all these years tony seems to be very out of place due to the attack and then hell get the chance to catch in his state more laugh than blood shed this movie is just a start in the 80s teen wolf was an improvement from this out of stars
0,worst movie ever cant believe i wasted 90min of my life watching this crap the only reason i didnt turn it off was i wanted to see the gangster dude on the cover and he wasnt even in it talk about false advertising the people that gave this movie a ten are either dumbstupid or cast members or friends of cast membersbr br i gave it a solid because no one else didbr br i have to write more and i dont even want to wasting my time talking about this rubbish please dont watch it and if you did then vote so this movie can go where it belongs bottom 100 movies i cant even tell you how bad it really is think the worst movie ever that youve seen then times that be ten and thats this movie it sucked if you just think im being bitter then watch it i dare you this movie should be used to torture war criminals or terriosts if they watch this even two times and theyll be spilling the beans and begging for mercy
7,this is arguably the best film director haim bouzaglo made until now a skilled tv director welltrained in storytelling and in directing his actors through long epics he tried to catch in this very lowbudget film the essence of the very special psychological situation the israelis live though under the permanent danger of the terror attacks resulting in distorted lives each character trying to live his own life to watch and control the other while being himself watched and controlled by other characters and mostly by the continuous pressure by political and historical forces well beyond his control some call this destiny but destiny has a very concrete representation in this filmbr br there is no explicit political saying in distortion characters never discuss politics not even at the level of saying bastards when they hear that a new terror attack happens their reaction to events is to localize the attack and to count the victims using the official and media terminology for the dead and the wounded they do not really live but rather survive on borrowed time happy to have survived one bomb and waiting for the next one to happen personal social professional life seems to work someway but is deeply flawed and influenced by events the main character played by the director is a playwright whose midlife personal and creative crisis is amplified by the pressure of the events and by the fact that he is lucky enough to leave a terror attack site minutes before the bomb explodes he hires a private detective to follow his girlfriend who is a tv investigative reporter whom he suspects is falling in for the subject of her next show  another failed man former military whose business and family life dismantles under the events he starts to write a play that carboncopies the reality and will bring it to the stage in theater in film scene that reminds hamlet as well as synecdoche new york its not that i would dare suspect charlie kaufman looking over the shoulder of bouzaglo he certainly needs not that but the israeli director screen is brilliant into anticipating the later film and the first directed by kaufman as in the american film actors play real persons and start interacting with them in an realitymeetsstagemeetsreality melange which never lacks logic at least not artistic logicbr br bouzaglo directs his actors with the usual talent trusts them and allows them the freedom of living through the situations rather then acting them his style is much more free here than in his tv series and the distortion effects although borrowed from american horror movies work pretty well all over the ending seemed to me a little rhetorical and unsatisfying dramatically but the shade of the suicidal killer who is haunting the film and the whole situation in a temporal loop will also follow the viewer when remembering later this film
0,im not at all picky about horror movies and im willing to watch pretty much any of them that doesnt mean that im willing to rewatch many of them or that i wont have criticism for them this movie is creepy and is very well done in fact i think this movie would make an excellent doublebill with session 9br br i should specify before i get to my comments that i watched this alone i started watching it before going to bed and got about 15 minutes in before i realized that it was too effective so i saved the rest of it for the morning even while watching it in broad daylight it was still creepy however i cant vouch for how effective it would be when watching in a larger groupbr br after the death of their daughter a couple move to a remote cabin as a means of trying to come to terms with this death let me make note of this death  this is one of the rare movies that doesnt shy away from the death of a child this is much more important as it both sets the tone as well as explains much of the acting that permeates the moviebr br the couple is not doing well the wife has distanced herself from the relationship and the husband is doing what he can to try to bring her back while some of the comments have complained about their acting  one specified that they act more like a father and daughter than husband and wife and thats legitimate hes trying to give her more direction its a role that men sometimes take onbr br there are a variety of scares in the film and most are fairly nonviolent though grotesque in some ways the story itself feels very straightforward for most of the film and takes an odd turn near the end while the turn is not absurd it is certainly not what you expected from the way things had been progressingbr br moody atmospheric and very well done for something that appears to have been shot on video
1,this really should deserve a o rating or even a negative ten i watched this show for ages and the show jumped the shark around series this episode however is proof that the show has jumped the shark its writing is lazy absurd selfindulgent and not even worthy of rubbish like beavis and buttheadbr br it is quite possible to be ridiculous and still be fun  pirates of the caribbean the mummy count of monte cristo  all fun movies that are not to be taken seriously however there is such thing as ridiculous as in this is the worst thing ive ever seen and indeed this is the worst episode of stargate ive ever seen its absolutely dreadful and this coming from someone with a stargate in her basementbr br makes me want to sell all of my stargate props most seriously
0,the cult of personality has elevated the status of roger corman sam arkoff lloyd kaufman etc as kings of the bs because the folks at crown international were so key they havent been elevated to the status they richly deserve a film like the van may now seem like a disposable piece of drivein esoteria but it was a sizable hit when it was released not to mention subsequent rereleases as a double feature with other crown hitsbr br the van was a perfect example of crowns hit strategy of seizing upon the mood of moviegoers at the time of a films release here it was sex drugs rock n roll and the brief custom van fad as others have noted it is ironic that the hit song in the film refers to a chevy when the title vehicle is a dodge in the film itself i had a town selectman where i was at the time even declare these vans to be dens of sin on wheels a perfect ad line for the filmbr br there are the usual assortment of good and bad girls muscleheads and lowbrow hijinks including a supporting bit by danny devito in many ways this isnt much different from the old beach party movies of the 60s but now spiced up with nudity and drug use obviously done on a limited budget and a limited schedule the film coasts along pleasantly enough with a breezy charm that compensates for some by todays standards certainly unpc views of womenbr br the classic touch is a toaster for bobbys den of sin on wheels yes a toaster hey you gotta have something hot for those munchiesbr br grindhouse fest
0,magnolia presents itself as a wall to wall canvas of screaming shrieking overwrought hysterical twits who are all bedeviled by regret guilt and pain pt anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong messbr br a look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent and they were i just wish that every scene didnt involve an over the top shouting match or long digression into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have causedbr br i also think that anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre tableaus that open the film the opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at but the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display i kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the old testamentbr br i will say that the music by aimee mann was great and ill be looking for the soundtrack cd in short a good movie to look at and listen to the music that is if the actors would have shut up or toned it down it may have been
0,and it falls squarely into the category of awesomely bad  ie a movie drunk students would rent to get a kick out of i was at the sci fi movie festival and all i remember is a wave after wave of hysterical laughter as this movie premiered other critiques will better describe this movies fecal nature and i felt ohsobad at the poor guy from the production company who had turned up obviously to gauge the audiences reaction what he got was the sci fi equivalent of a drunken student audience and after a serious anime movie i think it was sky blue the audience was in a sombre mood and then this movie opened and within seconds everyone in the room was rolling in the isles i will bullet point the worst partsbr br script the funniest and worst part of this movie it clunks along a linear and predictable road with the occasional illthoughtout aside rubbish but eminently laughablebr br animation poorly done and put together if you can put up with drab backgrounds and gradually skimpier costumes for the heroine i know i can then watch out for the montage where she trasforms from a swedish peasant girl into lady deathbr br characters so onedimensional its painful there is a brief backstory with sidesplitting lines of dialogue and little light is shone on the actual motivation behind some of the main charactersbr br so in a nutshell if youve got a captive audience and a few beverages lying around try and make sure theyre alcoholic to ease the pain then slip this movie into the dvd and get in a mystery science theatre 3000 mindset there is no other motivation to watch this movie other than to laugh at it and its not meant to be a comedy do not watch this movie alone it could possible be even more boring to watch solo than new world with colin farrell as you wont be able to have a laugh at the ridiculousness with a friend or two

0,first lesson that some film makers particularly those inspired by hollywood need to know  just style does not sell i guess tashan when translated will mean style second if you are hell bent on selling style that does not spare you from having a decent storybr br tashan has some story which could have sufficed with some better director but it is not slick for example all three  saif kareena and akshay  are narrators at different points in the story but this setup is not utilized to properly there could have been a better mix and match of their narrations actions sequences are from the seventiesbr br cheoreography of the film is awful i think vaibhavi merchant just sleep walked through this film vishalshekhar have put up a good score but it does not belong to this film why is there a sufi song dil haara in tashan why is the cool hinglish song dil dance maare not on anil kapoor when he is the one who is english crazy br br akshay kumar is the saving grace of the film but he is in his stereotyped self you wont mind missing this film
5,formula flick of guy who wants girl guy who will lie to get next to girl guy who will get best friend to help in outrageous way comedus reliefus no to help deceive girl etc this ones been done to death and with rare exception of a few zrated outings its been done betterbr br stale plot aside the leads are attractive and theres a couple of good moments jonathon schaech has done better and his acting here came close to being phoned in not a complete loss but nothing new here in this tepid affair
0,i would like to say that curiosity got the best of me if only i saw a trailer id be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie i could have saved myself the most pointless one hour and forty minutes in my entire life and about twenty dollars this movie was a disaster waiting to happen and it is an embarrassment to hollywoodbr br the movie displays a vivid ignorance of reality for example this kids remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood and even enters this house its even covered with clothes is it not rational to believe that a remote can no longer transmit a signal under those circumstances hollywood obviously did not believe so common logic and any concept of electronics dictates the opposite i doubt the race car could even have reached the street let alone a house across the street another unrealistic trait is the lack of intelligence the criminals possess why is it in all these movies these criminals are rocket scientists until they encounter an eightyear old the kid is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists please theres more reality in the matrix also the leader puts down his real pistol and accidentally picks up a plastic pistol apparently he could not tell the difference even with a glove on one should be able to do that just because they look the same does not mean anything there is other senses then sight the traps are unrealistic as well if any one of them actually worked the criminals would be dead but hollywood intends for us to laugh at the funny results of the traps i did not laugh i sighed and rolled my eyesbr br but i recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they have seen a really bad movie the movie they saw will seem like citizen kane compared to this one otherwise skip this one for the sake of your pride home alone also raises a question we all know alex d linz stars in the movie but did he write it as well
0,did they use their entire budget paying the porno stars or whatbr br sound effects background music and the editing in general was so bad youd think some 12yearold wannabe made the filmbr br most of the acting was good considering the script the innocent virgin played her part really wellbr br the mutants look really cool and this actually could have been a really cool flick with the right brain behind the wheel but unfortunately for all involved thats not the casebr br turn left was made better than this movie and those guys didnt even have any money good thing i didnt rent the movie myself
0,i enjoyed every moment of this movie even though i knew they could never really be together with the life expectancy of a bomber pilot being only six weeks it made me feel for all of those women and men back in the 1940s who must have lived this story
1,daniell steels daddy what a refreshing story this movie glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children how rare is that in these times of heather has two mommies or what ever you fill in the blanks it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone with the fathers roles being prominent i was hoping this would be another daniell steel saga how disappointing to have it end every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role i would have loved to see each character develop over the years i loved this movie it is one i will defiantly watch every time its on good story good acting and i hope this isnt a spoiler but no obtrusive sex or bad language yes it touched my heart warning get the kleenex ready what i find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our entertainment be it television or movies daniell if your listening you go girl give us more

4,i love this show period i havent been watching very long probably only about six months or so actually but it is now my favorite show and probably will be for quite a while i love all of the characters except i dont really care for donna im not completely sure why i justdont find her funny and i dont think laura prepon is a very good actress other than her i find the rest of the cast pretty good kurtwood smith and debra joe rupp who played erics parents were extremely funny topher grace is also a great actor unlike a lot of fans i did not completely hate the 8th season i still watch it and it does make me laugh but if you compare it to the shows earlier seasons itsnot good randy is horrible the finale was decent nothing amazing but good  i do think it would have been better to cancel the show after ashton and topher decided to leave but oh well i have the fourth season on dvd and someday i hope to have all eight seasons on dvd some of its most hilarious episodes in my opinion were dinedash grandmas dead redstacey and streaking but i love every episode ive seen so far which is most of them i think  910 stars i would definitely recommend it

5,doppelganger has its moments but they are few and far betweenbr br essentially this is a grade b blend of poppsych thriller ghost story and horror drew barrymore plays a young woman who is haunted by the demons of her past most of her family has been murdered and she was in at least one case the prime suspect or does she just have a really bad case of multiple personality disorder george newbern is her new room mate and most of the action centers on himbr br newberns character is pretty sympathetic and both he and barrymore do decent work though not exactly good the mediocre to at times totally horrendous script and the unimpressive directing seem to have combined to sink the rest of the performances into oblivion leslie hopes character is memorable but so irritating that you will want to forget herbr br the plot eventually disintegrates into a bifurcated one story arc is psychological realism the other is supernatural horror outlandish climax which is so badly conceived acted and photographed that it effectively counteracts most of what value the film had achieved previouslybr br overall the film has the feel of what might expect to be the result of m knight shamalyans first undergraduate film class the acting and script for the two leads are just good enough to make you care a little about them  at least until the film derails utterly and completelybr br my recommendation  send your doppelganger but avoid a firstperson encounter

1,criticism of the film evening based on the novel by susan minot and adapted for the screen by minot and michael cunningham has been harsh so harsh that it may have discouraged many viewers from giving the film a try the primary criticism has centered on the fact that very little happens in this film about a dying womans fretting over a mistake she made one summer in her youth that famous actors were given very minor roles that the entire production was overhyped etc for this viewer seeing the film on a dvd in the quiet of the home a very different reaction occurredbr br ann grant lord vanessa redgrave is dying in her home by the ocean and her medication and memories allow her to share a mans name  harris  with her two grown daughters nina toni colette and constance natasha richardson as her daughters sit at her bedside ann relives a particular summer when she was a bridesmaid for her best friend lila mamie gummer  a marriage both ann claire danes as the youthful ann and lilas alcoholic brother buddy hugh dancy objected to feeling that lila was simply marrying a man of her class instead of the boy she had loved  harris arden patrick wilson her housekeepers son who had become a physician harris buddy lila and ann are woven together in a series of infatuations and romances that have been kept secret until now 50 years later as ann is dying the older lila meryl streep visits ann at the end and the secrets are revealed there are no such things as mistakes  life just goes on the film is a delicate mood piece and the script by minot and cunningham is rich in atmosphere and subtle life lessons yes there are gaps in the story that could have used more explanation but in order to maintain the aura of nostalgia of a dying ladys words such holes are understandable the film is graced by the presence of not only redgrave richardson redgraves true daughter collette gummer streeps true daughter meryl streep claire danes eileen atkins glenn close hugh dancy and patrick wilson but also with an ensemble cast of brief but very solid performances the setting is gorgeous cinematography by gyula pados and the musical score is by the inimitable jan ap kaczmarek lajos koltai being julia directs judge this film on your own grady harp
1,the premise was intriguing but sadly this film just doesnt do any justice to it the casting was quite good and it was shot beautifully  but stylistically much of the direction was inconsistent overstylized fast editing been there done that to no effect i was waiting for steven bochco to run in the credits followed by a commercial characters were identified exclusively by onscreen coke usage and pretty much everything else left to boogie nights for character development and no personable characters to draw the viewer into the story a very forgettable film

0,at the beginning of the film you might doublecheck the dvd cover and reread the synopsis a couple of times but no worries its not memoirs of a geisha that you purchased just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be still the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie as it shows how in the year 1840 a samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery he decapitates the two lovers before doing some harakiri ritual suicide through disembowelment cut to present day when the american ambassador in japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago from then onwards this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional lets start with the good aspects namely the original japanese setting and the presence of the delicious susan george who is my alltime favorite british horror wench well together with britt eckland linda hayden and ingrid pitt the bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter the restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff the spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into susans ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress in this possessed state she even lures the american ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests so strictly spoken its not really evil that dwells in the house just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their longdead hands obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening especially since the lightblue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in ghostbusters the house where evil dwells is probably the least scary ghost movie ever throughout most of the running time youll be wondering whether director kevin connor who nevertheless made the excellent horror films motel hell and from beyond the grave intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and overthetop like motel hell maybe but then again everyone in the cast continues to speak hisher lines with a straight and sincere face so i guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed the house where evil dwells is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesnt even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning i am fully aware of how shallow it sounds but the two scenes in which susan george goes topless are the only true highlights well those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously oversized spiders or are they crabs in the daughters bedroom how totally random and irrelevant was that if you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstepbr br trivia note for horror buffs keep an eye open for the demonmask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant japanese horror classic onibaba
3,this very peculiar setting of wagners last opera definitely grew on me when i first saw it i was somewhat annoyed by many of the films surrealistic images and felt that far too much was superimposed upon the story however if you can put up with a fair amount of rather recherch gimmicks i think you will find that the film does manage to capture the very strange otherworldly atmosphere of the opera and that there are moments which are particularly finebr br personally i never really understood the role of kundry until i saw how edith clever portrayed her her performance a lipsynchronized mime of the singing voice of yvonne minton is nothing short of dazzling from end to end and alone justifies the hours it takes to absorb the filmbr br another reason to delight in this film is that it captures the spectacular interpretation of robert lloyd of the crucial role of gurnemanz one which lloyd has performed to a crisp at opera houses throughout the world i have been privileged to enjoy him in the role of gurnemanz on the stage of the metropolitan opera several times and the lusciousness of his voice and the warm fatherliness of his interpretation of this noble character really needed to be preserved as did his performance in the characters two major monologues the karfreitag scene and the recounting of the prophecy in act 1br br the version i have seen was a videotape made for america and so there were subtitles which alas could not be done away with this is especially unfortunate because the translation used is very inaccurate and forces an extremely christian interpretation on a film which is already forcing layers of interpretation on the opera this seemed to me to be quite contrary both to wagners clear avoidance of christianity and his very deliberate attempt to generalize the christian elements of the story see footnote with spoiler at the end of this review i find it nearly impossible when viewing a film with subtitles to keep from absorbing them and strongly recommend that if in the dvd versions you have the ability to turn the subtitles off you do so and instead if the opera is unfamiliar to you that you read the libretto carefully beforehandbr br the bottom line is that there is much in the film which i dislike and would just as soon have seen done differentlybut it has risen steadily in my estimation over the years since i first saw it and i find myself drawn to enjoy it again and againbr br __________________________________________________________________br br footnote containing a spoiler a good example would be kundrys famous line i saw himhimand laughed this gets translated in the subtitles for reasons which escape me as i saw the saviors face it is especially irritating to me because throughout the libretto wagner very deliberately and carefully refers to this unseen character who need not be the biblical jesus as der heiland ie the german for the healera reference to the wound of amfortas and to all wounds and maladies and the need for healing
1,i didnt really expect much from the night listener and i actually never heard of it until i saw the cover in the videostore however the movie is very effective when it comes to building up suspension and tension on occasion it drags a little but it actually helps to keep you wondering whats going to happen and more importantly when as the movie progresses the character played by robin williams gets dragged into some kind of cat and mouse spiel to the point where he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth and existence about a 14 year old abused kid that noone seemed to have ever seen in person the night listener is an interesting story which is great in building up the suspense throughout the movie and youre pretty much kept in the dark of who is lying and whats real however in the end it kind of disappoints and doesnt live up to the potential it could have had it doesnt really give you a detailed or plausible explanation about the other main character which would have been helpful and interesting
2,my husband and i are the parents of an autistic little boy who lives in the same township as the screenwriter of this movie we were very upset that the jcc is bringing this movie to its jewish film festival because of the way that the mentally disabled character frankie is portrayed we went to see this movie at the local theater when it came out we demanded out money back we would encourage the screenwriter to donate a portion of the funds to the jccs achad program to apologizebr br we did not like seeing frankie  a mentally disabled and perhaps even autistic teenager  as part of a joke in which he keeps dropping something to look at the nannys breastsbr br there was no point to frankies character other than to say hey being mentally disabled is funny challenges like frankies are a serious matter families like mine are truly sufferingbr br the screenwriter needs to explain herself does she know families with disabled kids does she see the families with disabled kids week after week at the jcc pool
2,i watched written on the wind starring rock hudsonlauren becallrobert stack  dorothy malone robert stack was terrible just bloody horrible he was supposed to be a charming jetsetting millionaire instead he came off like a jerk from the word go the plot was stupid and overwrought and the romantic leads had no chemistry somehow dorothy malone won an oscar for best supporting actress although her campy tramp character was boring think the older sister from splendour in the grass filled with malice and bitterness and lacking charisma director douglas sirk has the entire cast overact their way through dialogue that felt forced and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes had a cameo by the actor that played the chief on get smart
7,we have a lake we have an animated meteor crashing we have a killer stopmotion dinosaur with flippers okay so lets call this movie the crater lake monster what else can we add hmm two idiots called arnie  mitch to define the ultimate definition of comic relief we also got to have a sheriff who doesnt really do a damn thing in this film and whom nobody listens to aw crap were over halfway through the movie and we forgot to insert a bad guy no worries lets introduce some guy with a moustache have him rob a store to indicate hes a bad guy then have him pop up somewhere near the lake have him chased through the woods and all this for the sole purpose of him ending up as dinosaur snack food that should workbr br a complete clumsy mess this film its logic will twist your mind to force laughter out of you the first film to feature dave allen as a stop motion supervisor after this one he joined forces with charles band for several years until the the midnineties when band ran out of money to pay him i guess the dinosaur effects are charming and the whole film is pretty damn unintentionally funny unfortunately thats about the only good thing that can be said for itbr br good badness yes the mindbending logic in the narrative should be enough reason to put it on the list if not arnie  mitch will do the trick 310 and 810
7,just read the original story which is written by pu in 18th century strikingly the movie despict the original spirit very well though the plot was modified tremendously the film language the rhythm the special effect are all from hollywood but still there is a chinese core it is amazing how hark tsui managed to combine them together the result is pure beauty
1,although in some aspects seven pounds is solid and interesting in some of its narrative style gabriele muccinos project is rather mediocre the movie becomes more and more sappy and manipulative as it move toward the end hearts human and emotional eyes physical and metaphorical seven pounds is more of an amateurish imitation of alejandro gonzlez irritus amores perros and 21 grams with lots and lots of flashbacks the problem is the story is quite predictable from very easily on through the movie thats too bad because seven pounds could have been as authentically good if ben and emily had been put in the right hands
2,shakespeare said that we are actors put into a great stage but when this stage is israel the work that we interpret multiplies for ten and all the actions we do are full of a hard style dan katzir manages to do a spectacular portrait of a part of life in tel aviv but besides katzir manages to penetrate into the heart of the israeli people and this people far from being simple prominent figures they speak to us from the heart katzirs film allows israel escape from dark informative crux in which they live and this wonderful country arises to the light as a splendid bird which is born of his ashes it is very great for me because the reality of state of israel which the europeans only know for the informative diaries or the newspapers appears as a close and absolutly human reality the reality of million people who looking for his place exploring the whole state the whole culture with the only aim to feel part of it katzir constructs an absolutely wonderful documentary and he demonstrates that when a man films with passion the deepest feelings are projected with force and these feelings cross our hearts thank you dan for open our eyes and give us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries of the world

1,and a made for tv movie too this movie was good the acting in it and the plot was just so great this one of the only movies ive seen that i felt warped my mind because after seeing it i was afraid of reaper coming to kill me through my computer screen there were just a few minor things wrong with this movie but its very easily over lookedbr br antonio sabbato jr did an excellent role in this movie along with janine turner and robert wagner this movie just has so much suspense and it made me wanting more because i never thought a low budget tv movie could be so powerful after viewing this i read the novel this movie was based on four times and it too kicked was great if you ever see this movie come on tv id watch it the effects in this movie were pretty well done i honestly dont know what a live calcifying human would look like but with the way the fx team did this movie i was impressed and all it shows is that all these bad made for tv movies out there with low budgets shouldnt suck so badbr br watch it its really good no really it is

3,firstly i would like to point out that people who have criticised this film have made some glaring errors anything that has a rating below 610 is clearly utter nonsensebr br creep is an absolutely fantastic film with amazing film effects the actors are highly believable the narrative thought provoking and the horror and graphical content extremely disturbing br br there is much mystique in this film many questions arise as the audience are revealed to the strange and freakish creature that makes habitat in the dark rat ridden tunnels how was craig created and what happened to himbr br a fantastic film with a large chill factor a film with so many unanswered questions and a film that needs to be appreciated along with others like 28 days later the bunker dog soldiers and deathwatchbr br look forward to more of these fantastic films
0,sandra bernhards without you im nothing the movie released in 1990 followed on the heels of her 1988 offbroadway stage production  what she and others refer to in the movie as her smashhit onewoman showbr br there were several changes in monologues and oneliners and the movie version visually revamps the story taking sandra from a fabulous existence as a successful stage performer in new york during what she calls her superstar summer to an illusory almost desperate existence back in her home in los angeles  her fictional manager in the film refers to it as getting sandra back to her roots to  upscale supper clubs like the parisian roombr br theres a point to be made here sandra tries to appeal her liberal worldview and her sometimes harsh critique of american pop culture to an audience that doesnt completely see it in la shes playing to a predominantly black audience trying to relate her ideas when all these people seem to want is shashonna a madonnalookalike stripper and even then with shashonna dancing to drum beats that resemble those from like a virgin theres not much to be said for the audiences enjoyment of the show the scene in the club throughout the movie is dryer than a bone a funny scene to catch is of a rotund man from the audience helping shashonna out of her pantsbr br but if shes going down sandras doing so with style and force conveying everything from foul confidence to punctured vulnerability  right to the point at which shes naked literally pleading for acceptance and yet somehow still swimming in the pool of her own transparent stardom her depictions of interactions with the likes of calvin klein jerry lewis bianca jagger ralph lauren and what were lead to believe is warren beatty are fictional and hilariousbr br sandra begins her show in her most awkward moment performing a quiet but mystifying rendition of nina simones song four women while dressed in a mufti and other african garb singing lines such as my skin is black my hair is wooly and they call me sweet thingbr br she resurrects and celebrates the ghosts of underworld art in a tremendously funny description of the frenzied estate auction for andy warhol leave it to andy to have the wisdom and sensitivity into the hours and hours of toil and labor that went into the indian product  that theyve been so lucky to cash in on this whole santa fe thing happeningbr br she expounds on the excessiveness of hollywood consoling a distraught friend then admonishing him saying mister if this is about ishtar im getting up right now and walking out of your life forever because thats too selfindulgent even for mebr br sandra illustrates the expectations of women in the age of feminism dressed as a cosmo girl sandra retells her younggirl fantasy to become an executive secretary and marry her boss she eventually concludes in relief ill never be a statistic not me im under 35 and im going to be marriedbr br sandra extols the opening of sexuality in society when he touches you in the night does it feel all right or does it feel real i say it feels real mighty realbr br finally she cries for change in progressive american society by channeling disco greats patrick cowley and sylvester and proclaiming eventually everyone will funkbr br all this comes in the form of glitzy schmaltzy but wonderful cabaret performances of songs written and originated by billy paul burt bacharach hank williams and laura nyro to name a few at the same time the idealized fictional incarnation of sandra  her selfgenerated mirror image  floats around town a beautiful black model with flowing gowns and tight bustiers reading the kabala studying chemistry and listening to nwa rap musicbr br in without you im nothing sandra bernhard explores emotions and existences that up until then shed only toyed with as a regular guest on late night with david letterman her almost childlike enthusiasm for shock exhibited throughout the 80s is thrown aside in the face of a subtler allure and her confidence in the face of materialism and american celebrity proves refreshing this approach to comedy would change sandras direction forever and mark the more mature more personable entertainer to comebr br if you like subtle humor to the point of engaging in inside jokes about glamour celebrity sex loneliness despair and shallow expressions of love and kinship this movie will keep you in stitches it may not be meant to be funny across the board perhaps its a bit unsettling or even maudlin for some but consider the emptiness of the world sandra paints for you and youll understand just how funny and brilliant she really isbr br but see without you im nothing with a friend in the know because its definitely funnier that way before you know it the two of you will be trading sandra barbs and confusing the hell out of everyone else
0,i saw this movie as a kid on creature feature when i lived in new york it was a pretty creepy movie though not as good as horror hotel i just bought this movie on dvd and it is different from what i remember because in the dvd that i bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in french andor italian and no subtitles are provided then the other actors respond in english to what was being said kind of weird also on the dvd box the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on imdbbr br aside from that this movie is different in that the character of elsie takes her clothes off and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene julia tries to force elizabeth barbara steele to make out with her by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while steele resists that scene existed in the tv version but it was very edited i wonder if there is any extra footage that could be incorporated into a remastered ultraedition it seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced to bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions where are the master tapes and all the unused footage br br aside from the first boring twenty minutes before allen is delivered to the castle the rest of the movie is pretty good there arent too many special effects but herberts face after julia clubs him is a good one the creepy atmosphere and the strange exotic and seductive look of barbara steele make the movie a lot better than it should be i can honestly say that if barbara steele had not been in this film it would be a big zero she makes the movie a ten
7,if my grandma did films they would probably do much better figure than this one incredible bad the main characters the mom the dad and son are ok specially the mother shes a nice actress and the kid also proves to be a nice one specially on the scenes where he is supposed to be scary but does the the director know the meaning of the words plot point triller and good script the script hasnt any evolving atmosphere to become a suspense thing if you like being chased by trees you can probably enjoy it otherwise just stay at home and sleep oh actually there was something funny the movies from 2001 but we couldnt realize it since the image is so bad like on minidv and the cars are so old like 70 and 80s
0,being someone who lists night of the living dead at number three in her top five favorite movies of all time and at the same time loving this student film parody i feel i must defend this movie against the previously posted scathing reviews this short but sweet opus has always been a crowdpleaser at horror and science fiction movie marathons where those who attend have a love of the genre yet know not to take zombie movies too seriously this film is a tribute to the original not an insult it is intended to be funny and many others who i have heard chant for and applaud it agree with me that it succeeds especially for those of us who have seen notld 50 times watch for the director cameo as news reporter jeff drexel and also if you have the opportunity catch his alien parody loaf
2,as it is often the case the impressive and explosive trailers of asian films add up to nothing more than lackluster stories similar to unleashed which was great dog bite dog tells a story where men are raised as ferocious savage dogs that carry out their masters bidding the main characters an emotionally undeveloped amoral killer who is matched against an equally unstable police officer are far from the common heroes and villains we often see in fact by the end you lose track of who youre supposed to empathize with failing to feel even the slightest emotion for either of the men  whether that was the failure of the director or perhaps the underlining message he was trying to tell is up to you to decidebr br although the beginning of the film was filled with intrigue and unpredictability by the halfway point it slopped down to a humdrum story of survival and revenge the suspense which was evident at first soon disappeared because of a grossly mismatched music score which brought down the potentially effective story telling and in the end you were left feeling that all that detailed background information and introspection of the main characters was somehow very unnecessarybr br on the plus side the transition in story from point a to point b was quite atypical compared to us movies  so those who arent familiar with asian films and are tired of hollywoods predictability should check it outbr br the white balance seemed off throughout most of the film it was like looking into a picture shot on fluorescent when it was supposed to be set on tungsten maybe im the only one but it strained my eyesbr br the movie also enjoyed playing tricks on you  an interesting buildup gave me hope for the slow moving story until it was diverted to a low budget low speed chase scene and just when you think you were going to get an unanswered indie ending with a mix of shakespearean tragedy you realize that its not an ending at all but rather a transition into a wacky countrymusic montage about peace and serenitybr br throw in some grisly frombehind choke scenes a moment of redemption unexpectedly brought back into savagery and back again the other way asians fascination with bodily fluids and a horrible music score that didnt match the film and you get the average bland asian thrillerbr br i just dont get why every fight scene was overlaid with clips of roaring lions i thought they were supposed to symbolize dogs ultimately in the end we are reminded about a true killer that still lurks amongst us  tetanusbr br 410
5,i just watched the convent for the second time i had enjoyed it previously and figured it would make for a good drunken friday night film some gore some style bit of humour and suchlike i was saddened to find that i could no longer appreciate it much it seemed like someone had set out to revisit cheeseball epics like night of the demons for a modern audience but lost the things that made the original worthwhile for the record im not even a huge fan of night of the demons but there were some things i really dug about it the convent does the cheese but the not the goodness so much apart from the main girl likeable performance from joanna canton the goth girl and a sweet cameo from adrienne barbeau pretty much all the characters were excruciatingly unlikeable festering at the absolute lowest levels of moronic offensive jockhood the film is then gravely hampered by the complete lack of gratuitous nudity which means that given the awful dialogue it is difficult to watch the characters and harder to appreciate the good points of the film the evil nuns are original in design and get lots of good scenes though not scary their certainly kinda cool and the film also fields a fair amount of neat gore towards the end when adrienne barbeau is on the scene the film becomes quite entertaining cause all the obnoxious people are dead and its an evil nun bashing frenzy the stylised direction also occasionally yields good results although sometimes the camera just moves too fast all in all this was a film where for me the shining good points just cant make up for the things i hated those more fond of this kind of film may well enjoy it a lot more but for me it wasnt a good time
2,pialat films people in extreme emotional situations usually with several violent scenes in la gueule ouverte hes dealing with the devastating effects on a womans husband and son as she dies of cancer in a nos amours the teenage girls sexual experimentation leads to violent confrontations with her family here we have a rather spoiled young woman who abandons her husband to take up with a sexy excon her motivation is a little cloudy since loulou is incapable of reading or discussing anything more challenging than tv shows on the other hand hes got a fabulous body i wonder why depardieu never made a sports movie to show off that physiquehe would have been great as a rugby playerbr br the casting is impressive isabelle huppert isnt allowed to give a bland inexpressive performance she has given many depardieu plays loulou with all the dynamism and charm you could wantsee the scene in the bar where hes stabbed in the gut runs away and seeks treatment then soon restarts with nelly guy marchand with those coalblack eyes and distressed look plays nellys husband beautifully its a fine repeat of the pairing in coup de foudre
1,the movie is very lengthy and unfortunately pretty different from the novel if you want to see the movie then dont read the novel first as it will shock you however cinematography was ok and if you are a person who loves adventure genres which explores africa then go for it acting performances are adequate however many important events that were present in the novel are omitted in the novel sir henry curtis was in search of his missing brother rather than a lady in search of her father gagool was cunning and was killed in the cave whereas here she was shown to be a good person who preferred to stay with the new king
1,the first sidestory in the universal century gundam universe presents a refreshing new look at the war between earth and the space colonies the focus is no longer on a small group of individuals who would go on to play pivotal roles in the conflict but on the everyday civilian population and how the war is seen through their eyesbr br the story does contain some gundam staples its premise being the attempts by a zeon squad to capture an experimental gundam but it the execution of the plot that made this show so interesting to watch this series focuses on the experiences of a young boy named alfred and the relationship between his neighbor christina mckenzie who is secretly a federation pilot and a newbie zeon pilot named bernie wiseman alfred develops a sort of brotherly love for bernie while our young zeon pilot also falls for christinabr br war in the pocket proves that you do not need a sweeping epic tale about special individuals to make for a good war story there are no uber ace pilots or large scale fleet battles to be seen here this short episode ova focuses a lot more on character emotional drama over other themes like politics or philosophy and i love how realistically portrayed the characters are alfred is your typical everyday kid who plays violent computer games and thinks the armed forces is cool he is then given a crash course in the horrible realities of war the unlikely friendship and bonding between bernie and christina each not knowing the fact that they are soldiers on different sides of the war is played very real without going overboard with the romance drama stuff same goes for the endearing relationship between alfred and bernie that being said i would not want to spoil much of the story here but it makes it a whole lot more heart wrenching to watch the tragedies that unfold as the show moves along all the way to its emotionally devastating twist ending br br despite its lack of action this show never falls into the category of boring the characters are just that engaging enough to carry the whole show not to worry as there are a number of mobile suit action scenes scattered here and there each are beautifully animated on a level that surpasses that of an ova and are sure to satisfy the craving for some mandatory mobile suit battles in a gundam seriesbr br normally watching anime in japanese or english i would leave up to personal preference but in this case i strongly recommend the english voice track over the japanese one not only do the characters whom all except alfred are caucasian sound more believable in english but the performances of the english voice cast are on par and even surpass the japanese one instilling each character with such realistic emotions and intonations that they sound just the acting in some live action tv dramasbr br in short this show does not try to impress the audience what it does is conveys numerous heartwarming themes that hit closest to home especially the death of innocence on the battlefield and the horrors of war through the eyes of a child a truly moving little story that deserves more credit than it is being given
3,this series just gets worse and worse poorly written and just plain not funny the premise is excellent but the writers inexperience shines through by trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about and resorted to that patronizing smug oh silly you style acting that comes with a no laugh script they roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say arent we zany isnt this funny well no its not actually gum disease is less painful no wonder with the exception of corner gas canadians generally avoid canadian tv come on cbc youre suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of canadian talent pull the plug on this amateurish mess
7,a poorly written script with no likeable characters as for it being a comedy i forgot to laugh its about conceited friends who scam to get women in too bed with them no sex scenes and another friendwho is semidiscustingly weirdwho sometimes also scams but mainly is considered as being the guy who masterbates the friends separately meet and fall for the same woman amanda peet somehow this is done without really any romance the guys stop being friends as they separately dated her she scammed them out of their friendship because they scammed women  a bad movie
3,as with all the other reviewers this movie has been a constant in my mind after 30 years i recall going to the library researching all that i could on this story i even wrote to the pbs station for more information despite all this all i was able to find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of the 1900sbr br fastward to 2002 after years of searching ebay for on a weekly basis and there it was a vhs copy of the movie there was one other bidder but i was determined to win this movie the losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which i gave her despite owning a copy i still searched and searched finally finding a site that sold a dvd copy of the movie you can find it at httpwwwjohntoppingcomharvey20perrwar20widowwar_widowhtml
2,this is a very entertaining movie a few of the reviews that i have read on this forum have been written by people who apparently think that the film was an effort at serious drama it was not made that wayit is an extremely enjoyable film performed in a tongue in cheek manner all of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us the fight sequences are lively brisk and above all not gratuitous the socalled green death utilized on a couple of occasions is not as i read in one review gruesome a couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between doc and seas near the end of the film hey lighten up again i remind one and all that this is a fun film each phase of this fight was captioned which added to the fun aspect the actors were not trying to emulate bruce lee or jackie chan this is not one of those martial arts films ron ely looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play doc another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the bad guy seas is dealt with i promise you that if you dont try to take this film very seriously and simply watch it for the entertainment value you will spend 100 minutes in a most enjoyable manner
3,i watched lion king more times that all my friends put togther having a baby sister you know how it is by now i memorized both the plot and the lines after lion king came out i was like ok well let me see the second one was significantly weaker then i saw an ad for lion king and 12 i was like ok there we go again after watching the 12 i was like wow all my expectations for repetitevness were broken a truly lovely and original plot keeps you glued to your seat for the entire time i have noticed that the cartoon was filled with so many comical moments that roflmao will apply here 100br br i definetly recommend seeing the cartoon
0,start of with the good bit several times swayze talks zulu to his friends or that language is heard among the tribes thats a great plus as normally usa  uk movie audiences think all people on this planet speak english just in case youre one of them no they dontbr br but the acting is tenenkrommend as we say in the netherlands it makes your toes curl and not in a good way i like swayze but in this hes awful the muscles in his jaws make overtime and hes frowning the whole movie some one must have told him it looks butch no patrick it looks silly and is compensation for lack of character alison doody elizabeth has opted for a style of acting that does not meet the style of her coworkers her acting is s relaxed that this movie could have been set in the current days and its not your frock was a clue alisonbr br the best acting came from the people from the african continent and sided onyulo as umbopa i liked best clear warm and in character his performance is a joy to watch br br general it is mwahentertaining on a rainy day pity could have been better sack the director
0,if you really truly want to waste two hours of your life do the following br br look through the tv listings find the movie men in white when men in white comes on sit and watchbr br and thats it after sitting through two hours of bad puns dreadful and not that funny movie references and experiencing something with possibly the lowest production values ever made in recent history you will have wasted two hours of your life and wonder exactly whybr br why did i do this i was stupid enough to think that this film might actually be some good it wasntbr br but on the other hand if youre old enough to remember power rangers you might spot some familiar faces during the film presumably to save on production costs saban who also make power rangers decided to liberally sprinkle old monster costumes from everyones favourite tacky toyspawning franchise throughout the film i spotted quite a few old monsters from episodes i saw from when i was a kid so i guess it could at least be said it has some nostalgia valuebr br but if you want to see actual power rangers monsters go watch power rangers itself its much better than this piece of garbage and thats saying something

5,near the closing stages of baby mama one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it was all just a mess i really couldnt say it any better than that and while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyones time a lacklustre cast mundane script and vague caricature characters ensure that baby mama certainly isnt taxing on the ol noggin but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour consisting mainly of very routine clich jokes based around an odd couple rich and poor trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographicbr br as a story on finding love its not that bad but playing this plot line as a sidestory of sorts to work alongside the comedyorientated odd couple tangent characterisation is notably weak resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles as characters themselves both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness so while we may eventually come to find the characters interactions with each other amusing at times the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles we dont feel for the characters and dont find them inherently interesting but rather their dynamic unfortunately however although this dynamic works best or at least better than the individual personas as mentioned above it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the oddcouple formulabr br kate tina fey is a successful business woman who has hired working class dumbblonde angie amy poehler to be her unlikely surrogate and after angie decides to leave hopeless husband carl dax shepard both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences yes its the typical oddcouple premise and one that we have already seen in this years what happens in vegas yet what baby mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semilayered characters kate and angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air in fact the movies only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of romany malco who gets lumbered with playing a doorman of the few times that i laughed during baby mama most of those moments were because of this man and the remainder usually fell to shepardbr br its a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its scripts themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera and yet director michael mccullers goes from page to screen effectively enough yet for a film about babies multimillion dollar business and cultural stereotyping this isnt necessarily a good thing baby mama is gradea hammy plastic tinseltown with capital bore topped with sugar so not only did i feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their twodimensional nature but i simply didnt care for the world they inhabited the dialogue along with sets costumes and the scripts general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the directors incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy these arent characters and that isnt our world in any way so why should i care at the end of the day however a romantic comedys ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests and the frequency of its laughs baby mama has little going on in any of these departments of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair im sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored in this respect baby mama avoids being unbearable but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch baby mama is too lightheaded to be interesting and too shallow to be entertainingbr br  a review by jamie robert ward httpwwwinvocusnet
6,this movie displays the kind of ensemble work one wishes for in every film barbara bain and donald sutherland who play husband and wifeare positive chilling discussing the family business as if it were a grocery store or a dry cleaners macy campbell ullman and ritter are also terrific they play off each other like members of a topnotch theatrical troupe who realize that a quality product requires each actor to support the others unselfishly and finally theres sammy david dorfman what an amazing performance from a childand what an uncanny resemblance he has to ullman whose son he playsbr br were treated to a unique story in panic and thats a rarity in these days of tired formulaic crap the dialogue is sharp and smart and this relatively short film nevertheless has the power to elicit a full range of emotions from the viewer there are places to laugh to be shocked to be horrified to be saddened to be aroused to be angry and to love its not a movie that leaves you jumping for joy but when its over youre more than satisfied knowing youve spent the last ninety minutes experiencing a darn good piece of workbr br more of us would go to theatres if we were treated to quality fare like this when are the powers that be in hollywood going to wake up its a real shame when something this good fails to get exposure beyond festivals and households fortunate enough to have cable
4,i enjoyed this show for two reasons richard dean anderson amanda tapping these two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors the replacement of rda in seasons 910 was enough to take the heart out of the showbr br the chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous you get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling this relationship carries over into the program we get to seebr br rda gives his oneill character believable personality he never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest you watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances still they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilousbr br there is a lot going on between carter and oneill under the surface they manage to keep the lid on but often just barely the episode solitudes in season had some of the best drama ever seen on television the love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it togetherbr br carter and jackson often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by oneill yet oneills tactical instincts always seem sound he understands what to do without having to think about the matter the team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his ordersbr br the quality declined markedly in seasons and 10 the original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest ben browder was far inferior to rda in carrying the show he had his rare moments with claudia black but that was all amanda tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons you could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby she was probably thinking more about the child than the showbr br the spinoff stargate atlantis has a few moments but is mostly a weaker effort the major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original the villains wraiths are so improbable as to be ludicrous maybe amanda tapping can breathe some life into the program or it wont last beyond the fourth seasonbr br there has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show to have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in scifi the use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad the campy use of decor from ancient egypt concealing ultramodern technology is just as hard to acceptbr br i wondered about some of the continuity on the show too in the season opener daniel jackson is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded he crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet the episode hathor has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the sgc yet it is never mentioned again this device could have been used in several later episodes on daniel oneill and dr frasier
1,based upon the recommendation of a friend my wife and i invited another couple to this film i really apologized to themall of us hated it and spent the whole time looking at our watches waiting for the film to finally end half the vignettes are bizarre with very little entertainment value there were few scenes of parisfor example i was looking forward to seeing some pictures of the latin quarter but i couldnt really recognize anything most of the scene was inside a bar no one in the theater laughed at anything or reacted in any way if you like bizarre pretentious pseudointellectual films dont miss this if you are down to earth like me you will be sorry you saw it
7,what was this supposed to be a remake of fisher king why do we care about sandlers character what a slow dreary boring whogivesadamnaboutthesepeople movie just simply painful to sit through i turned it off before it was over its so obvious that cheadle needs help as much as sandler like i said can you say fisher king and how does this psychotic character function in his daily life we arent supposed to think that deeply i guess why does cheadle continue to give sandler a chance to turn violent on him if they were such good friends how did they grow apart if cheadle is so in control why does he keep seeking the advice of the shrink on the street we are never told thats why fisher king was a better film on so many levels and why this just sucks nearly out of 10 average score i dont agree at all even the top films are lucky to get such a high average rating and this crap doesnt deserve to be in the same universe with them
0,i have seen a lot of movies in my life but not many as bad as this it is a movie that makes fun of fat people has no real story has bad actors is not funny and much more is this a movie that you would like to see i guess notbr br i guess that the makers of the movie was trying to be original and creative but it looks like it was made by a 12 year old child with absolutely no cinematic skills at all the so called funny parts is as funny as throughing pies in the faces of people or breaking wind of cource if this is the kind of humour that you like then this is the movie for youbr br dont waste your money on this movie
7,as a long time fan of peter odonnells greatest creation i watched this film on dvd with no great hopes of enjoyment indeed i expected to be reaching in disgust for the remote control within fifteen minutes but instead i thoroughly enjoyed this production and i especially enjoyed and appreciated how the producers and director succeeded in telling the modesty blaise back story they managed to avoid the trap of making a bad film version of the books we are all so familiar with choosing instead to concentrate on a period in modestys life only alluded to in the novelsbr br as for the production values and i am no student of cinematography yes the film was filmed on a tight financial and time budget and maybe that shows but does it spoil the viewers enjoyment in this case i think not instead we are introduced to one of the worlds greatest literary heroines and given a taste of her capabilitiesbr br in regard to the casting because we in unfamiliar territory the only people who really matter are modesty and perhaps professor lob for me they were totally credible alexandra staden described by some as wooden and too thin to be an action heroine brought to the screen modestys poise and coolness her technique when martial arts were needed but most importantly personified the integrity which is at the core of the modesty blaise canonbr br ok so we all know this film was produced to stake miramaxs claim to the modesty blaise character it was made quickly and cheaply but i for one cannot wait to see the next production in this series by these producers  as long as they keep to the core values and characterisations of the original stories
3,great movie  especially the music  etta james  at last this speaks volumes when you have finally found that special someone
1,im amazed we see even one naysayer criticizing this old film we dont ordinarily get good opera films and here is a true grand opera rendition understandably the visuals are not great its dated but as opera it cant be faulted and im an opera buff i cant even detect one lipsync if we didnt know that was tebaldi in the audio nothing would convince me it isnt sophia loren she does everything with flair her dark makeup is fine and she brought the role to gorgeous life the rest of the cast is wonderful as is that stunning ballet troupe most of the actors are excellent loren truly marvelous her rival amneris is also terrific whoever didnt care for this 1953 job is shamefully remiss verdi would have enjoyed it naturally renata tebaldi as aida is the engine behind the scenes i love this old movie
4,perhaps being a former moscovite myself and having an elastic sense of humor prevents me from tossing this movie into the arthousefestival crap trashcan its not the greatest film of 2005 nor is it complete garbage it just has a lot of problems i also sincerely doubt this movie was banned due to any ideological fears or conservative taboos or any other reason this movie might conversely be called courageous and uncompromising abroad it was banned because the censors knew 99 of the russian filmgoers would find it offensive because of the bad taste exercised during the shooting and editing of this otherwise dull filmbr br so we have a strong opening shot wonderful sound design excellent premise  laden with meaning and symbolism the usage and placement of symbols will consistently be of the films strongest aspects not that the number is a daunting visual challenge over the next 40 minutes we have an equally strong setup an amusing and wellwritten bar conversation among the main characters and we feel pathos for these people the great country of russia the human condition and all that then the movie starts slowing down we begin to wonder what yawn lies aheadbr br the rest is quite boring simply put sure the guy in the village tugs the heartstrings and there are some slightly amusing moments nice sound sure but the enjoyment of this movie not to mention the plot are seriously compromised by the pacing problems and this this lack of a payoff for sitting through all the nicelyshot abject misery and bleakness is what ultimately will make people angry at the offensive stuff personally the main offensive scene bordered on being endearing in that pathetic way harmless drunks can appearbr br if you want to watch an enjoyable movie where russians get wasted for prolonged periods of time the entire film watch particulars of the national hunt much more rewarding postsoviet stuff so yeah a out of 10 for nice and symbolic of my postmediocrefilm condition
1,i just saw a press screening of this film and i was pleasantly surprised not often is it that i get to see all of my favorite actors in one film at one timebr br i really enjoyed the pick pocket scene and it was good to see rachael bilson and hayden back together i think their chemistry on camera is a direct result of their time together off camera my favorite scene was by far surprisingly so bret ratners piece without giving too much away ill just say that there is a surprise that leaves you hangingbr br the old couple were really good together and you actually got the impression that they had spent a lifetime together br br both the chris cooper and the ethan hawke segments packed a punch with surprises that seem realistic and similar to experiences that ive had in the big apple over all the film is a great place to take a date especially if youre already fond of the city itselfbr br i cant wait for the next in the cities of love
6,one of the many merrie melodies cartoons that entertained american moviegoers during wwii bob clampetts an itch in time portrays a hobo flea settling on elmer fudds dog the little guy turns into a real sadist while making a home on the dogs back but elmer warns the dog one more scwatch and ill give you a bath meanwhile the flea is setting up dynamite on the dog and thats not the end i noticed that in one scene elmer is reading a comic book featuring bugs bunny and porky pig obviously elmer and bugs frequently costarred but elmer never costarred with porky unless you count the very short any bonds today but to me the thought of elmer reading about these other famous characters from his same genre stresses the metaphysical nature of his world as though he knew of their existence within his universe even though they dont appear in this cartoonbr br of course im probably going too far in my analysis im sure that the cartoon was intended as pure entertainment and it certainly entertains as for the i might get to like this line it sounds as though that was something that the censors wouldnt have allowed but somehow missed i for one dont actually know what it was supposed to sound like was it something sexual as for the end had i thought that id seen everything i would have been tempted to look for more rather than do what the cat did although it was a neat trickbr br the guys behind these cartoons sure had a thing for tnt didnt they
3,three girls an allfemale mediacrew including cultactress barbara bach no less visiting a small town to cover a festival end up renting rooms in a house they should have avoided like the plague wellmade little shocker suffering a bit from some redundant dialoguescenes and a rather thin plotline that doesnt do very well in hiding its secrets one underlying theme in particular is quite disturbing as in vintage shockmaterial and this is basically what the film thrives on performances  cinematography are pretty much above par compared to many other late 70searly 80s films in the same vein but what really makes me recommend this film is the fairly long climaxscene in the basementsetting from the moment that keller junior character was introduced his performance made my jaw drop open and it didnt close until the end of the film a very pleasant surprise to see actor sydney lassick who was funnily wacko in one flew over the cuckoos nest and now utterly demented in the unseen take on one of the leading roles
7,this is a great film the first time i saw it i thought it was absorbing from start to finish and i still do now i may not have seen the play but even if i had it wouldnt stop me thinking that the film is just as good
0,ya know when one looks at this brian depalma film today im sure there has been allot of criticism about how dated it is also about the violence when i looked at this film on vhs when i was 20 i thought it was ultaviolent and gritty as well but i didnt get itbr br a few decades go by and man how i know how much i didnt get in this film this is a remake of an excellent film which was done back in the 30s40s how can you improve upon a classic ya dont but you tell a tale that is brought up to date through the eyes of the new immigrants during the most greed ridden decade the over indulgent 80s depalma stone and the gang present an ambitious disturbing and darn right good filmbr br yesdisco was dying and new wavepunk were taking over but these immigrants from cuba who had to make a new home in florida couldnt tell the difference it was exciting it was what they wanted but how to get it to these immigrants there was only one way to get it in florida where they wereby having lots of money and to get the money you had to take over running a drug empirebr br al pacino was fantastic to me as tony montana the little train that could what an amazing way to have your lead character look at america to fight kill steal lie cheat all to get  the money the women and the powerbr br thats what tony saw as the american dreambr br he wanted it he wanted to live it and in his circle saw nothing wrong with how he went to get it tony montanas command of the english language was heavily saturated with the f word but what did you expect emily posts finishing school for him and his cohorts look at how they came to america what they knew what they were exposed to this is the way tony and his crew chose to be all they can be in america it was all about the power tony montana would and did anything to achieve itit all its violent lying stealing crooked thieving glorybr br the part of the film that personified the 1980s to me is the money laundering tonys crew bringing sacks of drug money to the bank did those around tony and his crew care at the clubs where he spent and drank nope money was money and with money you get the power tony was living high off the hog he and his pretty blond american trophy he married played well by michelle pfiefferbr br after tony montanas rise to power he finds out its really crappy up there hes riddled with doubt hes drug addicted hes paranoid hes surrounded by those who want to take him on in a bloody takeover his trophy 80s american blonde drug addicted wife he finds out is a bore he needs to keep atop of his empire becausehes going down and down he goes in a horrific violent fashion but again i ask what do you expectbr br this is the quintessential 1980s film telling you a warped tale of how some misunderstand the american dreamto obsession its violent bloody overly sobut it drives the point disturbingly home not all cubans thrown out of cuba who landed in florida in the 80s were anything like tony montana give me a break but the showing of how miserable the 1980s were with its emphasis on greed and money as the only measures in the usa to be somebody and have power took its tool on these poor characters and their lives in americabr br makes you wonder  has anything from then  been learned today

1,gadar is a really dumb movie because it tells a fake storyits too unrealistic and is a typical sunny deol movie that is aimed to bash pakistanthe movies aim is to misguide the viewers so they can think that pakistan and its government is bad but trying to hide their own flaws wont workand all the songs and music of the movie are all badmost likely the sikhs will love th movie cause they are being misguidedthe movie sucks and sucks with power i think only amisha patel was good in the movie if i can give out of 10 i would but the lowest is 1please save hours of your life and do not watch this stupid boring movie disaster
5,i loved this show so much and im so incredibly sad its canceled i thought it came back too but just two stupid weeks thats terrible i hate how we never find out how everyone ends up it sucks bring it back abc has stupid shows like supernanny and whatnot but doesnt give time to good ones like six degrees if theyre complaining about ratings it was probably because they had a bad slot because this was truly a good show something i could relate to and anticipated jj abrams delivered hes awesome i wish abc could just trust him enough to complete the story i loved the entire cast too i couldnt wait to see how everyone would someday meet each other at once everyones story is now left incomplete now ill never know if steven and whitney would get together or carlos and mae i wanted to see what would happen to laura or damien and everyone else this is really such a downer
6,my personal vision of hell is being locked in a room without the ability to close my eyes or block my ears and have this movie play for eternity on every available surface in that room the whole notion that streisand plays a boyman only begins to scratch the surface of how ridiculous a premise this movie is the single most important thing about watching any movie is the concept of willing suspension of disbelief    it is impossible to do that in this movie
0,quite simply this shouldnt have been made its predictable and clichd the on screen chemistry which made the first my girl so captivating is nowhere to be found here and the acting as a whole is stilted and forced the writing also leaves much to be desired some of the memorable lines such as earpeircing a barbaric custom are just shocking where my girl provoked a genuine feelings of sadness and some genuinely funny moments like so many sequels my girl tries to recreate these emotions generated by the audience and fails miserably maybe im being hard on this film because of how great the first one was but quite honestly it insults the quality of the original with the sort of drivel this installment serves up surely this has to come close to son of the mask as being one of the worst sequels of all time in both cases the old saying rings true if it aint broke dont fix it
0,that jamie foxx would ever deliver such a wonderful oscarwinning performance one of the reasons why i was so impressed with foxxs performance in ray was because from watching his hammy obnoxious acting in movies like bait and booty call i would never imagine he would ever hold the oscar if people told me five years ago that jamie foxx was one day going to win an oscar i would laugh right in their faces who knows maybe hes better off sticking to drama because if you watch bait its clearly evident that comedy is not his forte i swear jamie mugs so much in this movie that im surprised his face didnt fall off and why does he have to do those stupid voices at every chance he gets anyone familiar with comedians like bob newhart and steven wright knows that doing comedy doesnt require being loud and obnoxious if a joke is funny its funny if its not funny then doing some crazy accent is not going to make it any funnier the problem i have with some comedians who decide to try acting is that they favor getting laughs over being in character in real life normal people dont always have witty comebacks and quips like albert brooks said in an interview discussing his character in taxi driver its important to be funny as your character rather than be funny as a comedian a prime example of jamie violating that rule is the nauseatingly awful scene where his mug shots are being taken and he starts posing for the photographs like a model if a regular person were being thrown in jail would he really be acting goofy while having his mug shots taken and wouldnt the police try to scold him if he was there are many scenes like that throughout the film another awful sequence is one where jamie is on the unwittingly on the phone with the villain and he starts doing a phony caribbean accent not funny not to mention jamie never seems to acknowledge the timing of a joke giving a comedic performance requires patience whereas he goes straight to the punchline whether its the right time for it or not im not even a big mike epps fan but even his performance is good in comparison to jamies as a matter of fact this is the first time i felt somewhat relieved whenever he would appear on screen epps has the same flaws when it comes to comedy but at least he chooses a more lowkey approach one of the few bright spots in this clunker of a comedy is david morse a highly underrated actor mostly known for his supporting roles as villains he seems to be the only actor in the film concerned with grounding it in reality however fellow green mile star doug hutchison is disgustingly overthetop as the villain a big surprise considering he gave a superb performance in the green mile also playing a heavy antoine fuqua has proved his directing chops in movies like the replacement killers and training day even in bait he shows he can direct a hell of an action sequence his only problem seemed to be in disciplining jamie foxx who probably improvised half the script with one bad joke after another unless youre a diehard fan of foxx please dont take the bait
1,as a child i always hated being forced to sit through musicals i never understood why people would break out into song like that and i was far too young to appreciate the artistry choreography set design costumes pacing behind it all carol reeds oliver was the one musical i remember oddly enjoying as a child probably because it is one of the darker ones and is appropriately drenched in the spirit of dickensian squalor this is a musical about ghetto life in victorian london and while the scenery and set designs are stark dark and true to that way of life it is flat out bizarre for people to be breaking out into such ridiculous songs amidst their misery upon a recent viewing my first since childhood i have some new thoughts and insights into why this musical works in that bizarre breaking out into song kind of way and why most just dont do it for mebr br when musicals work or really say something it is because they realize their own inherent strangeness lars von triers dancer in the dark as tragic and operatic and over reaching as it was worked as a musical because the musical numbers were the products of the imagination of the protagonist an immigrant obsessed with hollywood musicals likewise the very cynical and enjoyable chicago worked on a similar level because the musical numbers were the products of a homicidal ingenue singerdancer musicals dont work when they take their own musicalnature too seriously like in moulin rouge or are simply too much fluff about nothing ie something pointless like mary poppins upon viewing oliver for the first time as an adult i saw it in a new light told mostly from the point of view young oliver i saw the musical numbers as the products of his childhood imagination and his way of coping with the horrors of ghetto life around him the best musical number was probably when nancy got everyone in the tavern signing and dancing about the joys of getting drunk as a cover to help poor oliver escape the clutches of the evil bill sykes it was undeniably catchy and sounded like a real pub tune that drunks might start singing around a piano there are other great and classic tunes to be heard here and the direction and acting from the leads to the dancing extras are all top notchbr br still for all its bleakness although it does have a happy ending for oliver at least though certainly things didnt end happily for nancy and unless you think a life on the streets being a pickpocket is fun it wasnt a necessarily a good ending for fagin or the dodger despite their peppy closing tune i wouldnt really classify this as a family film though i dont think showing it to kids over the age of seven or eight will do any harm this is a harsh tale about an unfortunate orphan trying to survive on the streets and find some happiness i think it would be very interesting to see a modern update on this some how perhaps a revisionist take on it where people on the streets of compton break into happy songs about their horrible lives id like to see a hardedged hiphop version of oliver i always thought dickens would translate well in those regards as it stands oliver was probably the last of the great film musicals and maybe the strangest grated film ive ever seen

2,this comedy with much underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail there have been many films of this genre with more notable actors attempting to achieve this elusive mixture which havent come anywhere near the depth and deftness of this one this is surely because the exceptional cast with outstanding performances by reg rogers and ally sheedy seem so spontaneous that the reality of their characters rapidly grip your interest and emotions and hold them throughout the film at first the action seems rather offthewall and harebrained but one gradually learns that these two rather pathetic damaged people are desperately and unwillingly trying to heal themselves even if grudgingly through each other rogers heartrending facial expressions of numb hurt and sheedys angry outbursts are so eloquent that one feels them as one observes them you will care about these two likable but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because its in doubt and all hangs on a tenuous emotional thread hopefully audiences will get to see more of reg rogers and ally sheedy as this film proves their merit as very accomplished actors beyond doubt
2,if there is a movie to be called perfect then this is it so bad it wasnt intended to be that way but superb anyway go find it somewhere whatever you do do not miss it
5,while i count myself as a fan of the babylon television series the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there the pace of the gathering is slow the makeup somewhat inadequate and the plot confusing worse the characterization in the premiere episode is poor although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems i remember the gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series
6,despite a decent first season this series never came close to realizing its potential set as a prequel to the original star trek series it was doomed almost from the start by an executive producer rick berman who felt compelled to artificially limit and constrict the definition of what a star trek series could be which made this futuristic show increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic standpoint the actual showrunner brannon braga didnt help matters by his uninspired and tired rehashing of previous trek episodes and careless disregard of the franchises internal mythology it was painfully obvious early on that he was in it only for the paycheck never have i seen a series that so consistently did a disservice to a cast of talented actors jolene blaylock exceptedlast so long it is as if this entire series was produced in bubble existing outside the contemporary television landscape where the audience even a trekker audience is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic wants and desires unfortunately it appears as if berman and braga have succeeded in convincing the higher ups at paramount that enterprise suffered from franchise fatigue and that its core audience was did not walk away but was driven off produce a quality offering that lives up to the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they the audience will comebr br simply put in a teevee universe where we are given shows like battlestar galactica and the shield the powersthatbe must give the viewing public a star trek that measures up and is dramatically competitive it is just that straightforward and easy
0,this superb film draws on a variety of talented actors and musicians at the top of their form  levant crosby martin rathbone manone are completely at home in the story that apparently was supplied by billy wilder one would love to know more about how much he had to do with it because its an exceptionally clever variation on the sterile masterfertile servant tale  nearly an allegory of the entertainment industry run by driedup numskulls but made into a vibrant world of art and play by an exploited underclass of nobodies and nonwasps looking at the last six decades of music tv and film in the us its hard not to see the underlying insights of this film as prophetic
2,i got in to this excellent program in about season and since then i have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on dvd and keeps getting better and better with the seasons of and 10 it now may not have richard dean anderson now but the addition of ben browder and claudie black it has still given the show more strength and original still even after 10 seasons sadly now the scifi channel got rid of this amazing show with no hope relay for a 11 season there are making two direct to dvd movie and hopefully more atlantis is still going strong on its 4th seasons and there is a third spin off in the works the stargate franchise is nowhere near dead this tv show is a must see for all scifi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people watch it  1010

0,manipulative drama about a glamorous model margaux hemingway who is raped by a geeky but unbalanced musician chris sarandon  to whom she had been introduced by her younger sister played by reallife sibling mariel whose music teacher he is while the central courtroom action holds the attention  thanks largely to a commanding performance by anne bancroft as hemingways lawyer  the film is too often merely glossy but also dramatically unconvincing the jury ostensibly takes the musicians side because a the girl invited assault due to the sensuous nature of her profession and b she was offering no resistance to her presumed aggressor when her sister arrived at the apartment and inadvertently saw the couple in bed together what the f she was clearly tied up  what resistance could she realistically offer br br the second half of the film  involving sarandons rape of the sister which curiously anticipates irreversible 2002 by occurring in a tunnel  is rather contrived mariels character should have known better than to trust sarandon after what he did to her sister but margaux herself foolishly reprises the line of work which had indirectly led to her humiliating experience almost immediately the climax  in which sarandon gets his just desserts with margaux turning suddenly into a fearless and resourceful vigilante  is however a crowdpleaser in the style of death wish 1974 incidentally ubiquitous italian movie mogul dino de laurentiis was behind both filmsbr br its worth noting how the two hemingway sisters lives took wildly different turns this was the film debut of both margauxs career never took off despite her undeniable good looks and commendable participation here  while mariel would soon receive an oscar nomination for woody allens manhattan 1979 and interestingly would herself play a glamorous victim of raging violence when essaying the role of reallife playboy centerfold dorothy stratten in bob fosses star 80 1983 with the added pressure of a couple of failed marriages margaux took refuge in alcohol and would eventually die of a drug overdose in 1996 chillingly the hemingway family had a history of suicides  notably the sisters grandfather celebrated author ernest who died of a selfinflicted gunshot wound in 1961

5,karloff and lugosi  together again this is one of those films that casual fans will pass over and tend not to appreciate as much its not an allout horror film like the duos previous two hits the black cat and the raven but it is very worthy of boths talents and is a fun film when revisitedbr br the invisible ray was directed by lambert hillyer a director who mainly made westerns but curiously in these final days of the laemmles reign at universal he found himself helming this and the laemmles final horror film draculas daughter both are crisp cleancut fantasies that are very light on horror content despite the fantastic elementsbr br just as lugosi went wild in the raven much needs to be said of karloffs hamming in the invisible ray the one aspect of the story that is particularly unsatisfying is that karloffs character rukh acts so madly before he is poisoned by radium x that there really isnt much of a change once he starts glowing this is very similar to the complaint people have about jack nicholson in the shining  hes basically a loony right from the start there isnt any real transformation same here halfway through karloff simply has an added purpose for revenge in his mind i still enjoyed his performance though just as i did lugosis overthetop antics in the ravenbr br meanwhile lugosi completely surprises you and gives a restrained and thoughtful turn as rukhs rival in science dr benet lugosi also has some of the best lines in the film including a memorable warning to the police trying to catch rukh of which i am in alignment with horror film writer john soister on  and if he rukh touches anyone the inspector inquires lugosi hesitatingly replies in a way that only lugosi could deliver they die just as lugosi could be so off he could also be more perfect than any actor this is one of those momentsbr br therefore karloff and lugosis interactions are all very good as we get the mad antics of karloff pared off against the cool logic of lugosi karloff would go on to play similar mad scientists many times however one wishes lugosi would have gotten to play more straight roles like this one he only had one more chance ninotchkabr br the invisible ray is a fun film and a real treat to the true karloff and lugosi fans it is one of those films that improves on each viewing not because it is a masterpiece but because of the charisma and talent of its stars and how this story complements the darker more horrific pairings they had the special effects by the always innovative john fulton are terrific and the supporting actors are all adequate frances drake looks as beautiful as she did in mad love and plays a strong woman something seldom seen in classic horror films the scene in the end when karloff stalks her and she doesnt scream is one of the most haunting moments of the film a terrific fun film
6,ok even if you cant stand liza this movie is truly hilarious the scenes with john gielgud make up for liza one of the true romantic comedy classics from the 20th century dudley moore makes being drunk and irresponsible look cute and amusing and it is damn fun to watch the oneliners are the best

7,it is incredible that with all of the countless crimes that have been uncovered and laid unequivocally at the doorstep of marxism from the berlin wall to the gulag archipelago to the cultural revolution to the khmer rouge one still finds admirers of communist totalitarianism in hollywood and are still making propaganda in its favor it just shows the moral depravity of hollywoodbr br in this particular film a psychotic murderer is glorified needless to say that neither his crimes nor his psychotic proclamations were included that both the director and the actor expect audiences to sit through this seemingly interminable propagandistic film demonstrates the tunnel vision that they have in regards to their object of worship
6,though not a fan of sam rockwell i was surprised when i saw his name in the credits in the opening of joshua heck i wasnt even aware he was in joshua until i started the movie so it goes without saying i was watching the movie on the basis of the movie not the leads a sort of rosemarys baby the omen or any other demonic kid movie joshua was billed unfortunately it fell flat slow incredibly slow and flat yet i continued on to see how this would all resolve hoping beyond belief the ending climax would shed some light on the subject okay i admit it did a wee bit but what a stale closing and what a lowlow budget movie or at least thats how they designed it a person falls  you dont see the drop you see someone lying down in what appears to be blood a person gets hit by a cab  you dont see it you see someone complaining holding a bike up im not sure if this is called style or laziness or simply lack of funds for special effects we have a rich family with a crazy mom a workaholic father attempting to balance everything a kid  joshua who maymay not be the antichrist and a new born baby girl who cries a lot she cries as much as we see how many days shes alive  and what was that about are there rats above or is it joshua is his mother nuts is joshua crazy is he merely jealous of the newcomer to the family is he going to grow up to be michael myers or does he drive his family to the brink i dont think so they were nuts prior and no socalled acting could make me believe otherwise unfortunately barely any questions were answered barely any open doors shut im sure that might have been the idea but for petes sake give me something anything there are plenty better kidgonewild movies to explore joshuas more like the minime of the antichrist
1,so every year there is at least one movie that hasnt got any chance of being a box office success because from the moment of production even before one simple shot is filmed everybodys picking on this movie there is a long list of these kind of movies and in the end some are really bad battlefield earth 2000 some may have their flaws but are quite enjoyable catwoman 2004 elektra 2005 and then there are a few which actually are really great for what they are but no one admits i mean my gosh just because the wide crowd does have to have a victim each year they can pick on not everybody has to join them so yeaaah maybe those movies arent perfect but cmon how many movies are not every movie is supposed to be a new the lord of the rings not everybody will enjoy these movies but i bet there are more than who admit they do hudson hawk 1991 who is just hysterical funny color of night 1994 which may not be oscarworthy but is definitely a not dumb at all thriller with some nice twists swept away 2002 which i thought is a great mix of sick humor and a beautiful romance gigli 2003 which was great entertainment with some really memorable lines and not badly acted at all from the former bennifercouple and this year its basic instinct well when i heard the rumors of a sequel to one of my favorite movies i was very sceptically and although i really love sharon stone i stayed sceptically until ive finally seen this movie and really i was very positively surprised i cant understand why it gets such a bad press and such a bad voting here it never simply copies the original it has a quite clever story has tension action humor and the absolutely stunning sharon stone reprising the role of her life with 47 years when shooting the movie she looks hotter than many stars in their 20s but its more than her being beautiful its brilliantly acted with all her looks her famous smile the way she speaks and moves from the very first frame shes in you cant take your eyes off of her its simply a pleasure to watch her as catherine tramell and all of the other actors deliver solid performances too so i really cant see whats wrong with this movie it has a dark thrilling sexy and gritty look strong performances and you never felt bored maybe the story isnt oscarcaliber but it never even tries to be its an entertainmentmovie and by this standard it absolutely delivers in my opinion so give it a try
0,midnight cowboy was never a great movie to start with but it is a classic you know its a classic the moment its insistent theme song everybodys talking starts up on the soundtrack actually not written for the film and the way the camera introduces us to joe buck naked and in the shower we had seen jon voight before but had never really noticed him but when he tells us hes one helluva stud whos to doubt him this was a great performance that had iconic star status as well as a complete grasp of the character and if voight had never done anything else his performance here would still be legendary as it is voight has seldom disappointed on screen even a piece of ham as well cured as his performance in that glorious rubbish anaconda is a source of pleasurebr br the film became famous and infamous almost overnight it was a crowdpleaser even with its downbeat ending funny and sexy and recognizably real it was the tailend of the sixties and all the characters rang true it was also the first x rated film to win the oscar as the years best picture adapted brilliantly by waldo salt from a james leo herlihy novel it was probably the first mainstream commercial american movie to deal with taboo subjects such as homosexuality and drugtaking in a matteroffact manner everyone is recognizably human warts and all and everyone is treated sympathetically voights joe buck is an innocent abroad a candide who comes to new york to seek his fortune as a hustler a profession he sees as glamorous and not seedy hes a cross between a gigolo and a social worker but when he himself is hustled by a scraggy wormy little conman called ratso rizzo dustin hoffman fresh from the graduate and hes a revelation he realizes that perhaps the reality is a little different from the pipedreambr br essentially its a male love story though totally platonic between these two not so unlikely bedfellows both totally alone both totally needy each becomes the protector of the other voight with his physical prowess hoffman with his streetwise savvy they are misfits adrift from the mainstream tolerant of their own peculiarities and the deviances of others though straight voight isnt beyond a homosexual encounter in a 42nd street cinema with a boy even lonelier than himself the whole film posits a strangely christian attitudebr br its also magnificently acted while voight and hoffman hold the screen throughout there are superb vignettes from the likes of brenda vaccaro and sylvia miles as well as john mcgiver bob balaban and bernard hughes as sundry customers and hangerson beautifully delineated little character studies that seem to transcend acting altogether while john schlesingers direction gives the film the feel of a documentary as well as an aliens totally detached eyeview of the american underbelly without rancor and without criticism on second thoughts maybe it is a great movie after all
2,ill give writerdirector william gove credit for finding someone to finance this illconceived thriller a good argument for not wasting money subscribing to hbo let alone buying dvds based on cover art and blurbs a pedestrian dennis hopper and a game richard grieco add nothing significant to their resumes although the art direction is not half bad the dialogue will leave you grimacing with wonder at its conceit this is storytelling at its worst no tension no suspense no dread no fear no empathy no catharsis no nothing a few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom but this is definitely a film best seen as a trailer i feel sorry for the guy who greenlighted this thing good for latenight zonedout viewing only you have been warned
0,spoiler bunch of passiveaggressive people having family reunion the script has them saying and doing things people would never do at least anyone with a shred of decency the hero falls for a woman he sees as his soul mate at a bookstore the day of the reunion unaware she will show up as his brothers girlfriend at the reunion he tries to defer to his brothers claim but she knowing our hero is clearly infatuated with her teases him mercilessly by wearing sexy clothing and behaving like a stripper rubbing all over the brother in a ruse excuse that she is showing him how to stretch at one point she actually disrobes and gets into a shower with him he tries to cover his eyes his heart is breaking she thinks its funny until she suddenly decides she doesnt want the brother and leaves the reunionbr br the movie really drags the audience coughed and fidgeted its way through the long haul the writing is unintelligent and unbelievable we almost walked out but kept thinking surely something would happen that would perk things up but nooooo all the lovely reviews must have been written by paid shills out to dupe poor suckers like me into seeing crap like this comparing it to little miss sunshine jeez shame on them the writers the actors the producers and the theaters for letting anything this bad make it to the screen
7,this movie was so great i am a teenager and i and my friends all love the series so it just goes to show that these movies draw attention to all age crowds i recommend it to everyone my favorite line in this movie is when logan bartholomew says rosy cheeks when he is talking about his baby daughter he is such a great actor as well as erin cottrell they pair up so well and have such a great chemistry i really hope that they can work again together they are such attractive people and are very good actors i have finally found movies that are good to watch lately it has been hard for me to find movies that are good and show good morals and christian values but at the same time these movies arent cheesy
1,this is the biggest load of crap that i have seen in a long time the last time i hated a movie so much was whilst watching 28 days later and magnolia there is absolutely no point to this movie except to see some really sick and twisted sexrape scenes gillian anderson relieving herself on the side of the road and every single sentence of dialog having to use the f word at least a couple of times in it it has extremely cheap acting and is very low budget my friend and i eventually turned off the movie after about half an hour we had tried to give it a chance but nothing could save this crud do not watch it
4,if your idea of a thriller is car chases explosions and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire then house of games is definitely not the movie for you if you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense then by all means see itbr br house of games tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer dr margaret ford lindsay crouse who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic mike joe mantegna to say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense frankly i find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming just like a clever con artist this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilancebr br the story is taut and wellcrafted the dialogue smart and laconic the acting uniformly good mantegna is superbly charismatic some have complained that dr ford is not a very sympathetic character and wondered why mamet would make lindsay crouse look so physically unattractive but dr ford is supposed to be cold and aloof moreover her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot at one point i believe that an injury to her sexual selfesteem is a key part of her motivation  ill say no morebr br house of games is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity it will hold your attention every second while you are watching and stay with you for a long time afterwards
3,this movie has beautiful scenery unfortunately it has no plot in order to have a plot there must be a conflict this movie had none it spent two hours painting a beautifule scene and failed to ever place any activity in it the picture trys to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story tellingbr br if you love montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just dont expect a story there isnt one
7,this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous and i have never seen such bad acting in my life the only good part about the movie were all the hot guysespecially drew fuller i dont know what these people were thinking when they made this movie i didnt even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves i mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn i would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch i was very disappointed the whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion
6,i dont know where to begin so ill begin with a snippet from the back of the cover of this movie alive combines the tension of vincenzo natalis cube with kitamuras own versus i have not seen versus so i cant comment on that but i think cube was an excellent movie which i recommend to everyone however in this case someone has clearly confused tension with boredombr br ill just go ahead and spoil the entire plot because besides being one holy swiss cheese of a plot its also moldy cheese and the movie is not worth spending any time on even if you dont know the plot beforehand so it doesnt matter if i have misunderstood the plot dont hit me  its probably because i had to struggle to keep my eyelids openbr br so the american military in nevada once lost a ufo i the nambi desert this apparently makes sense because theyre both deserts so surely theyre practically the same place different continents or not a monkey broke into the ufo and acquired an alien something which was passed on to a japanese researcher who had to eat the monkey to survive in the desert what ever the alien thing is now passed on to anyone whos bloodthirsty enough to kill the current host the japanese military wants to use it for military stuff so they decide to make it pass from the current host the researchers daughter to some other dude but instead of just picking someone out of the military which is full of people who are bloodthirsty and already on the militarys side they decide that its probably a good idea to pick some criminal out of death row instead oh and the reason they pick this particular criminal from death row is because he was the first person in history to not die from the nonlethal electric shock which is the standard execution method because everyone dies from the placebo effect when they get electrocuted i dont know if they do this so they can giggle in the staff room at how everyone dies even though its not deadly or if they just want to cut down the electricity billbr br then the movie turns into what the matrix would have been if it had been really lame and superfluous fighting bores us to tears for what feels like an hour and oh wait now they remember that they already had a dude who was infected with the alien thing so the entire movie up to this point was actually a totally waste of time and also human lives then everyone dies the endbr br the only one moment in the movie where i didnt want to go away and sleep or eat a sandwich instead was when a dude was pinned to a wall by a pipe through his chest and hes hanging around up there and another dude walks by the dude hanging on the wall says im in pain shoot me and the living dude looks at him and its not like hes a mean dude or anything so he really looks sorrowful and doesnt want the guy on the wall to suffer so he shoots himbr br rhetorical pausebr br in the stomach gee thanks a freakin heap

0,unfortunately there was not a for a rating or else i wouldve chosen it this movie lacks the star power that the original movie had in such abundance carol burnett albert finney tim curry bernadette peters edward hermann the innocence of newcomer aileen quinn and expert directing from seasoned pro john huston father of actress angelica hustonis what made this film so charming even the 1999 remake with kathy bates victor garber alan cumming and kristin chenoweth had more to offer than this sorry excuse for a sequel before she did this movie all ashley johnson was known for was her role as little chrissie seaver on the prime time show growing pains she had a few bit parts in movies but i dont know who thought she had talent enough to carry a movie on her own and adding joan collins as lady edwina hogbottom ridiculous they couldnt get good enough actors to play the major roles like daddy warbucks miss hannigan and annie but they will sign joan collins to play some british lady it doesnt surprise me that this movie was as bad as it was the critics were right to have not agreed with this movie even if it was only made for tv it was a poor sequel to an otherwise lovable movie
0,this movie may seem scary on commercials but the actual movie was a reason to vomit this is a below below average even lower than that and has no plot i mean every house can make you feel scared and sure a dead japanese woman would scare the poop out of you but so what make a movie that would appeal to watchers and not just show images of scared people and some hair dead japanese woman can you say horrible ripoff of samara the ring dont get me started with the dead child not even that scary so what he has a cat and he can imitate it big freaking deal just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential of being harmed by the grudge 110 yuck 
3,the 80s were not very kind to onetime major star charles bronson starting with 1982s death wish ii and ending with this truly gruesome film from 89 bronsons screenwriters seemed to be trying to top each other in progressive grossness dw ii left little to the imagination in its depiction of the rape and suicide of bronsons characters daughter a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in disgusting detail 10 to midnight was the sort of loathsome film that made you want to take a bath afterwards nothing redeeming about it other films like the evil that men do and the remaining death wish films from this period straddled the line between high camp and high barf with their earnest depictions of brutality and revenge im not sure if the producers usually pancho kohner got a kick out of showing a weary looking senior citizenaged bronson destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what but the shoddy craftsmanship and terrible scripts of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generatedbr br kinjite  the last of these films  is fairly wellmade but truly takes the cake in cinematic wretchedness in this film bronson sodomizes a perverse john forces a pimp to eat his rolex watch allows a male prisoner to get raped by another prisoner makes incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things ive thankfully forgotten also depicted is the gangrape of a young japanese girl fortunately this was offscreen though wellimpliedbr br what were people thinking when they made this film what was bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films for anyone interested in his best movies check out most of the films he made in the 60s and 70s like the mechanic death wish from noon til once upon a time in the west red sun the great escape the magnificent seven rider on the rain etc etc
3,beginning with its long opening shot of seemingly endless rows of assembly line workers in a chinese factory manufactured landscapes attempts to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies its droning narrative assumes that industrial development in china and elsewhere is entirely unprecedented as if there had never been an industrial revolution in europe and america and karl marx had never visited the british museum that there might be a connection between the presentday asian drive for industrialization and wealth and earlier experiences of starvation and terror is never mentionedbr br at the same time theres an effort to present edward burtynskys photographs of industrial waste as somehow beautiful much of the film is a slide show of these images they are well produced of museum size and have apparently appeared in several exhibitions to me however they only demonstrate that almost any photograph can be made to appear beautiful if well presented industrial waste is still industrial waste the relationship if any between the photographs and the films spoken message remains unclearbr br i dont mean to imply that there arent real and sometimes desperate problems when countries rush to industrialize manufactured landscapes however offers only strange and bitter hopelessness its like a twohour lecture by noam chomsky maybe it has some value as a demonstration of whats wrong with the american and canadian left

0,i guess this movie will only work on people who were all turned off by the giant hype of lord of the rings well so i was and so i really love this movie especially i like all those flawless superheroes from lotr being so perfectly and disrespectfully parodied most brilliantly is the counterpart of gandalf the brave and wise and completely humorless knowitall wizard almghandi the cowardice and brain dead transvestite saurons counterpart sauraus from east germany of course is wearing a simply bucket with eye holes as a helmet aragorns alter ego is yet another accident prone idiot who tries to fix his broken sword ulrike the legend with scotch tape and strunzdumm the counterpart of wormtong indeed has some strong resemblance with brad dourif and dont forget grmpfli and heidi huhhuh
7,i read some previous comments stating that this movie loses steam towards the end of the movie and also that it has a similar ending to cape fear i completely disagree im going to give a simple review for the normal moviegoers out there i thought the casting was perfect i thought this was one of ed harriss best performances what an evil psychopath i have a lot of respect for his acting after viewing his performance in this movie i was riveted throughout this movie if you like mystery thrillers then this definitely a movie you want to see i also noticed a young scarlett johannson in this movie this movie is filled with top stars and i highly recommend it
2,convicts is very much a third act sort of film all the dialogue and character interaction that occurs within it comes out of the long winddown of a late southern day and by extension the life of its main character soll robert duvallbr br this is the first collaboration of director peter masterson and writer horton foote six years earlier the worked together on the trip to bountiful a film that seems almost actionpacked in comparison to this one masterson is not necessarily a good director in fact hes just barely this side of adequate the slow pace leaves a lot of room for cinematographer toyomichi kurita who infuses the film with just the right sense of fragile light  warmthbr br because this is essentially a filmed play with little in the way of editing or directing prowess it all comes to the acting as far as im concerned theres no flaws here robert duvall and james earl jones two of the best american actors both born in january 1931 create characters that are wholly real uninterested in anything besides living lukas haas a young actor who i was familiar with from testament and witness plays a character very much like his other early roles he is quiet withdrawn slightly scared and sad somehow these are qualities that seem natural from himbr br perhaps a title like convicts is a disservice to this film that title along with the opening scene seem to create an image of a far more highstrung western type picture if slowpaced stage productions dont interest you terribly youll want to pass on this one as well otherwise this might be exactly the film you wish they made more oftenbr br enjoy
0,now ive seen a lot of bad movies i like bad movies especially bad action movies ive seen and enjoyed all of jeanclaude van dammes movies including the one where hes his own clone both of the ones where he plays twins and all three where hes a cyborg i actually own the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durians hey if nothing else hes got a great ass and you almost always get to see it with dvd you can even pause and zoom in thats why you can trust me when i say that this movie is so bad it makes plan look like citizen kanebr br everything about snake eater is bad the plot is bad the script is bad the sets are bad the fights are bad the stunts are bad the fx are bad the acting is spectacularly earthtimebendingly bad very probably showcasing the worst performance of every socalled actor in the cast including lorenzo lamas and thats really saying something and id be willing to bet everyone involved with this movie is lousy in bed to boot especially lorenzo lamas br br it does manage to be unintentionally funny so its not a total loss however i recommend that you watch this movie only if you are either a congenital idiot or very very stoned i was able to sit through it myself because i needed to watch something to distract me from rinsing cat urine out of my laundrybr br it didnt help much but it was better than nothing one point for ron palillos cameo as a gay arsonist
5,i watched this on the tube last night the actors involved first caught my attention the first scenes were attention getters some funny some sad good character development i felt that the latter third of the film diverged if it was not for the early part of the movie i would have stopped watching i kept watching wanting to how how it tied togetherbr br unfortunately i feel that it never happened i especially did not like the extend period that several of the character were talking yiddish  was that the other shoebr br would i recommend no i think not as other reviewers mention much of the slang is dated 60s jive but it was not too distracting the ending totally turned me off
0,youll notice by the stars ive given this great film that before you see it the first time is implied i had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week and last was a very slow rental experience not much great coming in im not sure how this movie slipped past me i love lucy liu and jeremy northam is great too still it didbr br this movie is an awesome example of what to do if you dont have a large budget it had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark just enough the entire film is you the viewer trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns i would have given this film 1010 however some of the shots were pretty fake looking i dont hold that against this film too much but i dont think it deserves a perfect scorebr br lucy liu is beautiful and mysterious as always i think shes pretty underrated as a serious talent nevermind her beauty which is difficult she really takes her roles seriously and doesnt rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotion and she can seem cold and even lifeless if needed as wellbr br jeremy northam does really well at first as quite a geeky corporate rat willing to run through any maze to prove himself however as he changes throughout the film its like night and day i know some fans of clive owen jude law or other hopefuls to become the next james bond will hate me for this but northam wouldcouldshould fit that bill hes suave and cultured hes got a great bond posture and voice i think he too can be cold if the situation calls for it and rather downtoearth as wellbr br great film and definitely this moviebuff recommends it to be seen at least once if you like corporate espionage films
4,in brooklyn a century ago the rivalry between chuck connors and steve brodie and their competing volunteer fire brigades leads to brodies famous bet that he can jump off the brooklyn bridge this is a story which will be familiar to a lot of people through a bugs bunny spoof bowery bugs from 1949br br this generally very enjoyable film would probably be more widely available if it were not for the notorious and unsettling scene involving some chinese tenement dwellers  a time capsule of antediluvian racial attitudes giving the film a great deal of historical interest in my view
3,man i loved this movie this really takes me back to when i was a kid these were the days when the teachers still showed classroom films on reeltoreal and if you were good they would rewind the movie slowly so you could watch it play backward i still remember one of the opening linestutazema was his name and he was an orphan he lived with his sister so and so in the village this is a great movie for kids and as enduring as the red balloon at the end the other indian boys in the village attach the feathers to tutazema and he becomes an eagle himself he gets to live the way he always wanted to he gets to soar the heavens
4,someday somebody is going to write an essay comparing paul naschys fury of the wolfman to the great spanish surrealist films lage dor and un chien andelou the naschy film is a masterpiece of delirium from beginning to end dali and bunuel probably loved it and ate their hearts out seeing someone do with such apparent ease what they had to rack their brains to pull offbr br the film lacks cohesive structure even though it does have a plot that moves from a to b to c some mishmash about a professor walterman  his first name mind you  who was bitten by a yeti monster during an expedition to tibet and hasnt been the same since which is understandable one of his jealous colleagues the insane daughter of the noted doctor wolfstein knows about his condition and reveals that his wife has been cheating on him but its a setup for a twisted scientific experiment to unleash his inner beastbr br walterman flips out turns into a werewolf kills a few people is electrocuted dies is buried unburied taken to a castle filled with circus freaks wired to various machines zapped with assorted electronic effects injected with potent elixirs is chained up turns into a werewolf a woman in an evening gown with thighhigh nazi fetish boots whips him he escapes helps the pretty female doctor find her way out of the castle fends off the circus freaks with a battle axe eventually turns back into a werewolf and has to fight to the death against the female werewolf incarnation of his cheating wife the lady with the nazi boots shoots him with silver bullets from her luger pistol they die together and the pretty doctor walks off into the morning with the studly reporter who did nothing look what a beautiful day it is br br la furia del hombre lobo was written by paul naschy in a hurry original director enrique eguilez was fired and replaced by jos mara zabalza a drunk who was infamously intoxicated throughout the production he was often unable to work though he did find time to instruct his 14 year old nephew to make some alterations to the script and naschy ended up directing much of the film uncredited zabalza did rally enough to clip some action scenes from one of naschys previous movies mark of the wolfman the scenes were fortunately good enough to use twice even if the costumes were different and helped pad out the runtime after zabalza refused to get out of bed to finish the movie post production was a nightmare nobody knew who was doing the editing the money ran out the master print disappeared for a while and then at a prerelease screening for a film distributor the executive arrived to find zabalza urinating into the gutter in front of the theater he was too drunk to find the restroom but at least he made it to the curbbr br yet somehow the film works if you let it it keys into those atavistic memories we have about murky castles vaulted catacombs chains whips gloomy moors fans of those sort of things will find it hypnotically watchable even if the story as a whole doesnt make much sense due to the fractured discontinuity of the execution in one scene its pouring rain and the wolfman howls at the lightning in the next shot its bone dry and hes howling at the full moon then its raining again and yet you dont look at it as a gaffe its like an unfolding dream where contradictions are possible opposites are the same and effects proceed causes first the wolfman picks up the power cable and screams and then the cable starts sparking with electricity people say its low budget hurts the overall effectiveness  i say the film would have been unwatchable if they had a dime more to spend it is a marvel of making something out of nothing and succeeds not because of what it could of had but because of what it does its easy to laugh at stuff like this and even easier to dismiss it the trick is being able to see through the mayhem or rather to regard the chaos as part of the effectbr br paul naschy died last week at the age of 75 he had been ill with pancreatic cancer for a year or more was working on film projects right up until his last days but passed away in madrid spain with his family while receiving chemotherapy treatment his rich varied and surprisingly lengthy career is a legacy to a man stubbornly pursuing his artistic vision in the face of universal mainstream disinterest and yet in all of us there is an eleven year old kid who will watch his movies like fury of the wolfman in rapt awe even people who dont like euro horror will discover something in this movie to marvel at if only for just a minute in a couple spots you can find it for free at archiveorg or even buy it on a dvd for a nickel its worth far far morebr br amusingly naschy was horrified to learn that many others like myself regard this twisted sick demented little movie as a classic if not an outright masterpiece of cinema dementia the problems he encountered during the production and the mess of a film that was left after were perhaps too personal an artistic disappointment for naschy to forgive i would never presume to dare to forgive it for him but i will say this id rather watch fury of the wolfman in its dingiest most cut and degraded fullscreen public domain print than ever sit though the overbearing obnoxious crap churning out up at the swine flu cineplexes this or any other weekendbr br the world lost a great artist this month watch his films and rememberbr br 910
2,ok when i saw the previews for this movie i thought it looked really scary and was quite excited to see it as were the group i was with now living in america especially during this election i see some very deceiving things but i have to say these previews were towards the top of list i dont see how so many people could be scared by this movie i only really noticed two real jump scenes and only jumped at one the whole movie was extremely predictable and perhaps that messed up some of the jump scenes for me as for the sound effects so many to be so frightened of i thought they were comical at best oh and the uhh catboy where did that come from and why the worst noise in the whole movie had to be the weird groaning how does that scare someone i can make that noise easily now dont get me wrong i have always loved all those really bad scary movies that your just laughing the whole way through but i didnt even think this one had that going for it it was just plain out bad
7,i watched this movie when i was almost quite a kid and naturally was moved to tears by this story of a fox family the fantastic scenery at hokkaid the excellent storytelling and last not least the wonderful soundtrack provide a rare intimacy with the protagonists i am still searching for some copy of the gorgeous soundtrack to german viewers it might be useful to know that the defadubbing is the only one worth listening to i taped both defa and br but i keep viewing the first one only
6,after seeing the 1996 remake i thought it was the funniest way to see cruella de vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin the whole movie was quite funny and on my view better than the animated one but there was actually no need for a second one first of all if cruela is returning dont cure her and make her insane again just make her break away from jail and thats a rap i thought it was not very funny its supposed to have only one original puppy returning id expected that it should be lucky since he was the most appealing and besides having roger and anita back too however they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred not even one hundred and two but only three puppies and a parrot that thinks hes a dog clever gerard depardieus part was pointless at the end cruella suffers way too much way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true she gets baked inside a giant cake that was a desperate attempt of physical humor trying to imitate the same effect from the first one that just didnt work it was too much over the top and not too funny i actually felt sorry about cruella
0,exceedingly complicated and drab im a bright guy but this was just too much for a tired brain it would really benefit from a few early clues as to who these people are and what they are doing probably better for the us market gc himself hinted that this alone did not supply his oscar and you can see whybr br still the sand dunes are pretty the nail pulling is nasty the attorneys drunk dad is a mystery the cricket is good to seebr br very difficult to write the required ten lines on this despite it being over hours long thank heavens they shortened it admittedly we dont get to the pictures much but the last film we saw walk the line was 10 times better and i dont really like johnny cash my wife says george still looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds so theres thatam i nearly there yet br br how about now
2,thanks to this fungal film i do not want my maypo cant stomach the thought of maltex or wheatena and even that granola over there doesnt look so innocent anymore why wasnt the song slop time by the sherrys used as the theme
2,   or type on a computer keyboard theyd probably give this eponymous film a rating of 10 after all no elephants are shown being killed during the movie it is not even implied that any are hurt to the contrary the master of elephant walk john wiley peter finch complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachydermsno matter how menacingwithout a permit from the government and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability furthermore the elements conspirein the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemicto leave the wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the elephant people as the natives dub them to close the story if you happen to see the current release earth youll detect the elephant people are faring less well today

0,the dream child of 1989 is the fifth film in the generally overrated nightmare series and at the latest from this point on the series became total garbage the only good films in the series were wes cravens 1984 original and the third part the dream warriors of 1987 the second part was disappointing and boring and it was the fourth part in which the formerly scary madman freddy krueger began to annoy with constant idiotic jokes this fifth entry to the series has hardly anything to recommend except for admittedly great visuals and one creepy scene a flashback sequence to how freddy krueger came into existence the rest of the film consists mainly of our razorclawed maniacturnedjokester yelling stupid oneliners and the old formula of a bunch of teenage jackasses who desperately try to avoid falling asleep because good old freddy awaits them in their dreams lisa wilcox is back in the role of alice johnson and a bunch of uninteresting crap such as a superdumb eerie childrens rhyme is added for no other reason than to have some sort of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel in short no originality just a decline of the old formula and an overload of painfully annoying jokes my generous rating of 310 is due to the great visuals and especially to emphasize the difference to the terrible next sequel freddys dead which is awful beyond belief in case youre not a hardcore freddy krueger enthusiast the dream child should be avoided and even if you are this is more than likely to disappoint
1,this is one of joan crawfords best talkies it was the first gablecrawford pairing and made it evident to mgm and to audiences that they were a sizzling team leading the studio to make seven more films with them as costarsbr br the film convincingly depicts the downward slide of a brother and sister who after their father loses everything in the stock market crash must fend for themselves and work for a living life is hard in the depression and soon even their attempts at finding legitimate work prove futile and they resort to underworld activity br br joan crawford is excellent as the socialiteturnedmoll shes smart complex and believable she even tempers the theatrical stiffness of the other actors early talkie acting style clark gable is a diamondinthe rough masculine and gruff as the nononsense gangster who becomes involved with crawfords character the same year he would play a similar and even more successful role opposite norma shearer in a free soul securing his position as top male sex symbol at mgmbr br if you like crawford in this type of role dont miss paid which she did a year earlier which is also among her best early talkie performancesbr br 
2,brilliant overacting by lesley ann warren best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none the corn on face is a classic as good as anything in blazing saddles the take on lawyers is also superb after being accused of being a turncoat selling out his boss and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently im a lawyer he says three funny words jeffrey tambor a favorite from the later larry sanders show is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto his character is more malevolent than usual the hospital scene and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site are alltime classics look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting one bleeds this movie gets better each time i see it which is quite often

7,the sopranos stands out as an airtight dynamic exploration of american life and how the american experience is shaped and defined by money by setting the story in the milieu of the underworld david chase eliminates all barriers to a grunt low to the ground and outright mean deconstruction of the postmodern era br br every character represents a facet of american industry tony soprano exemplifies the beleaguered working stiff torn between familial duty and a need to keep his business on an even keel the convergence of these two things is the imperative that keeps the story moving forward the characters of christopher paulie and bobby reflect the loyal  but selfserving underlings present in every enterprise who are trusted out of necessity rather than merit with the character of ralph joe pantoliano essays a brilliant interpretation of the charismatic psychopath a twisted businessman whos flourishes of violence are tragically outweighed by his stunning earning power and dominic chianese is the ultimate symbol of the antiquated oldguard which maintains power through established relationships and the need of the up andcomers to deflect blamebr br though abrasive and occasionally disturbing the sopranos has earned its place as the ultimate tv drama br br ps a good companion piece to chases series would be the shield another violent drama that manages to make the ugliest of characters interesting
5,there are two reasons why i did not give a to this movie one reason are some of the actors like malcolm mcdowell and gwynyth walsh work who tried to play at their usually good level of acting however at many scenes they were somehow blocked by the bad scriptingbr br the other reason is the cool idea and looking of the cyborg which is quite different to most other such roles ive seen so farbr br everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be boring scenes useless and boring dialogs bad script work and it seemed as it was the first movie ever for many actors it could have been an interesting story though but they failed completely
2,new york i love you just like its predecessor paris je taime is a compound of various stories that reflects the different kinds and aspects of love but unlike it the rhythm is much faster and the stories much shorter the movie offers a unique view of the city of new york with its various and different landscapes new york i love you offers a first class cast featuring such great actors like shia labeouf natalie portman ian mckellen hayden christensen chistina rcci and orlando bloom ethan hawke james caan and robin wright penn among others and some excellent writers and directors like brett ratner and anthony mingella
0,i usually try to construct reasonably wellargued critiques of films but i can not believe this got past the script stage the dialogue is appalling the acting very dodgy the accents just awful and the direction and pacing is scrappy at bestbr br i dont remember the last time i saw a film quite this bad joseph fiennes pretty as he is might just have killed his career as quickly as it startedbr br the island of doctor moreau was no worse than this garbage
7,i really like this movie i can watch it on a regular basis and not tire of it i suppose that is one of my criteria for a great moviebr br the story is very interesting it introduces us to characters each has a unique kung fu style that is very secret and very deadly each of these characters are trained by the same master but their identities are kept secret from each other the dying master sends the 6th venom his last student to attempt to make right the wrongs that he suspects some of his students have committedbr br how will the last pupil find the other venoms how will he know which of them is bad the way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie greatbr br we also get to see the venoms fight each other in every combination it is fun to see how their styles match up against each otherbr br if you want to see if you like kung fu movies this is a good movie to start with it doesnt get any better than this
0,its very funny it has a great cast who each give great performances especially sally field and kevin kline its a well written screenplay by andrew bergman honeymoon in vegas i dont like soap operas even though i never watch them but i do love this film because its so crazy and off the wall that it beats the hell out of any stupid soap that they have on daytime television in my opinion its the best film of 1991
0,minor spoilerbr br underrated little stephen king shocker its not perfect by any stretch of the imaginationeven if the limp performances of dale midkiff and denise crosby were better thered still be the mismanaged mystical story elements to contend with the old micmac burial ground rachels terminally ill sister and the jacobmarleyan victor pascow never really come together into anything coherent and the film in places feels confused and overstuffed but few horror movies really are perfect and what this one may lack in other areas it makes up for in its willingness to shock pet sematary may actually be one of the cruelest horror films in recent memory with its murderous zombie baby and its insanely insensitive portrayal of zelda its politically incorrect its tasteless its gratuitousand yet it makes us squirm with revulsion in a way safer horror movies never can add to that one of fred gwynnes best performances and mary lamberts witty direction and you have an intensely satisfying scary movieeven with the hokey ending highly recommended for genre fans 75 out of 10
0, let me start by saying that i understand that invasion of the star creatures was meant to be a parody of the scifi films of the 50s i understand that none of it is to be taken seriously the problem i have is that none of it works a parody should be funny and this one just isnt not once during the entire runtime did i so much as crack a smile in general i am easily entertained but i couldnt find a sliver of entertainment anywhere in invasion of the star creaturesbr br  i knew i was in trouble right from the beginning the two stars make their screen appearance with one of the lamest gags imaginable  a water hose they cant control that gets them both wet these two come off as bowery boys wannabes why anyone would want to mime the act and persona of the bowery boys is beyond me after the less than illustrious beginning the movies goes on to feature comical chase sequences dancing indians vegetable men decoder rings and other assorted unfunny bits its all just a complete waste of timebr br  i bought this on the double feature dvd with invasion of the bee girls that movie is academy award winning stuff in comparison with invasion of the star creatures
1,yeah well i definitely had regrets about giving up my saturday night watching this strange little yet very long movie apparently neither did the main character for stealing two hours of my life heres the epitome of the antihero in no regrets we have this jerk so messed up so wandering so selfish aimless and unlikable that it was extremely hard to get past the attraction a highly favored businessmans upandcoming son jaemin unless it was just that physical attraction he claims otherwise that its love but after watching this its like loving charles manson because you dig the beard alright hes not that bad but still no real redeemable characteristics i could never get past the reason jaemin endless stalks sumin it was never shown just told that jaemin loves sumin perhaps its a culture thing that flew over my head crazystalking  mad love over in seoul it has to be because a little more than half the movie is one stalking the other and the last part is stalking back and forth to the point i thought this was turning into a screwball comedy i was waiting for a tiger named baby to make an appearance okay so sumin works two jobs while going to school so far so good on someone trying to better themselves but after his first taste of his stalkers attraction he gives up his day job for some kind of prostitution ring what ok well as previously mentioned the obsession doesnt stop due to the jobcareer change and if you throw in a bunch of other very angry characters you get one messed up movie where unbelievable occurrences just seem to happen without buildup basic movie not 100 terrible but you can do better with foreign gaythemed movies
7,enough is enoughsometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is long dead the first tremors movie was great the second one was ridiculous the third one was nauseating the tv series was depressingly awful and this movie just drives the stake deeperbr br basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry now we have the series set in the wild west in the 1800s and they fight graboids like a rehash of the first one they have to learn how to beat them all over again mildly entertaining i suppose otherwise this straighttovideo release just like tremors and is just going way too far oh and i continue to wonder how there is never any record of these events taking placedid they just simply forget to record this unprecedented event i think something like this would be historymaking so our pals in the first film wouldnt be so unprepared br br movies like this that ruin the original just make me crazy avoid this garbage
7,this is a direct sequel to the mummys hand 1940 because the lead character stephen banning played by dick foran is now thirty years older and is relating the story with the help of archival footage to his sons fianc there are only two unusual aspects to the film the early death of banning and the presence of turhan beybr br lon chaney as the mummy kharis gets top billing though given the nature of his role he has little more to do than limp along or thrash his arms about theres nothing scary about his presence except for his attempt to carry off the fianc isobel elyse knox dick foran gets second billing but hes killed off within the first fifteen minutes wed have to wait until psycho 1960 when a lead character janet leigh dies way before the end of the movie bannings buddy from the first film babe jenson now henson shows up a little later looking much much older and not doing any of the comic shtick he did in the original its hard to believe its the same actor unfortunately this great acting job is wasted because he gets killed by kharis after only two brief scenes its then left up to bannings son john played by bit player john hubbard to led the chase to the cemeteryno the sheriff leads a torch wielding mob to bannings house to burn it down and kill the mummy sound universally familiar br br turhan bey is introduced to audiences as the new high priest mehmet bey to care for and feed tana leaves to kharis with his exotic voice and appearance its too bad he gets so easily killed a better movie would have had babe take von helsing type charge of things in tracking down the mummy with a final decisive battle with him and mehmet bay but instead we have a pedestrian rehash of different set pieces from previous universal horror films put together by the hack griffin jay who wrote many of universals other clunkers although he also did don winslow of the navy 1942 as well as don winslow of the coast guard 1943 which also featured elyse knoxbr br elyse knox played anne howe in six joe palooka movies 19461949 and of course turhan bey with 43 movie and tv credits is great in the title role of the amazing dr x 1948br br the cinematography is much darker and more atmospheric with lots of noirish shadows in the sheriffs office than the first kharis mummy film but theres little else of interest or excitementbr br ill give it a
0,i have only seen gretchen mol in two other films girl donnie brasco and dont really remember her but she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for pictures because it made people happybr br she really didnt think what she was doing was wrong even when she left the business and found her religion againbr br the photos she made were certainly tame by todays standards and it is funny seeing men with cameras get all excited and politicians pontificating on the evils of pornography david strathairn good night and good luck played a super part herebr br mary harron american psycho wrote and directed an outstanding biopic of the most famous pinup girl ever
7,this is a great film for mccartneys and beatles fansa splendid time is guaranteed for allthe audience feat some celebrities such as nicholson cuzakmichael douglas is as alwaysquite amazingfrom small children to old campaigners of the sixtiesthey know the words to all the songs by heart and some of them are crying when paul breaks into blackbird yesterday  all my loving and all the treasures of his catalog who except john lennon and dylan can claim such a repertoirethere are two particularly moving momentsbr br the double tribute to lennon and harrisonfirst here today performed solo the title was included in tug of war 1982 and was its best trackthen something when paul uses an ukulelebr br the long and winding road renditiona key momentwhen pauls voice cracks as he is moved to tears by the hearts the members of the tour crew hold in front of the stagebr br i rememberin the early seventies when people used to despise paul cause he was not involved in politicsas his expartner wasthey had to change their mind for paul is a committed artist fame is great cause it allows charitythe film shows different aspects of pauls activities an artist who is anything but selfish
0,this film has renewed my interest in french cinema the story is enchanting the acting is flawless and audrey tautou is absolutely beautiful i imagine that we will be seeing a lot more of her in the states after her upcoming role in amelie
7,this movie is really nothing besides an admittedly wellcrafted series of tense sequences punctuated with an inevitable gotcha at the end of each really there is no character development and no real plot to speak of there are only the most skeletal of motivations for the characters to do anything while they trudge forward to their unavoidable dooms its all just an excuse to show a creepy ghost kid who seems to have gotten some of the family cat mixed up in his ectoplasm and his ghost mom with long black hair hanging in her face kind of like the ring take down a bunch of cardboard cutout twodimensional excuses for human charactersbr br this englishlanguage version of the grudge is the equivalent of cinematic junk food satisfying momentarily but not really what you ought to be living onbr br not recommended
0,although its most certainly politically incorrect to be entertained by a drunk theres such a charm to dudley moores portrayal of lovable lush arthur bach one cant help but feel for this unique and wonderful character how can you not be entertained by that infectious laugh and giggle and utter silliness although im not really a liza minnelli fan she was really excellent as linda marolla and i couldnt picture anyone else in that role sir john gielgud was the heart of the film and deserved his oscar the rest of the cast also excellent and that great tune arthurs theme wow truly this was one of the best comedies of the 1980s great films get better with each viewing and that is the case with arthur
1,this movie looks like it was made for tv  for years i waited for some movie to be made about rubin carter because i loved to see him box at the old msg and to see this movie was very disappointingi have alot of respect for mr washington but he was awful and boringthere is really nothing good to say about this movie except i did like the song
7,movie about a small town with equal numbers of mormons and baptists new family moves in cue the overwritten dialog mediocre acting green jello salad with shredded carrots and every other inside mormon joke known to man anyone outside the mormon culture will have a hard time stomaching this movie anyone inside the mormon culture will be slightly amused with a chuckle here and there youll be much better off watching hesss other movies napoleon dynamite etc than trying to sit through this one the acting is mediocre jared hess has had his hands on much more quality films like saints and soldiers and napoleon dynamite i would recommend both movies over this groaner
0,think of this film as a saturday morning liveaction program from ages ago even the small tykes will find this one hard to please because it runs like molasses i cant fully understand how god awful it is to make something too typical and uninteresting especially in the costume department too many warriorwizard movies out there have used the same old plotline numerous times over but this is mighty scarce considering its appeal to the little darlings and who in the world wouldve let a topless mermaid be cast in the first place i thought this was a family movie mst3k heres another fine gem for your 1999 tv season
6,great little thriller i was expecting some type of silly horror movie but what i got was tight short thriller that waste none of our time mostof these movies we have to get into the back characters stories so we will either feel sympathy for them or hatred when people start getting killed o such foolishness here yes you see a few characters but they really only interact with the principals such as the husband wife at the motel whose room was canceled we saw them so we could just how efficient the lisa character was and how inefficient the new hotel clerk was we see the little girl simply because she will have a very small but important role later in the movie when all heck breaks loose the flight atrendants because we need on in particular to move the plot ahead the bad guy in particular needs her in the beginning of the flight the rude guy in the airport was important to the movie too the only characters that were just liners with no use to the plot were the two young guys on the plane that was clever because i thought they would have something to do with plot from the first scene to the last the woman character a young hotel executive named lisa is in charge even when jackson shows his true colors she doesnt panic she thinks what she can do to stall time any other movie the smart executive women would be acting like idiots but not this one it was a very short movie and i was waiting for the usual plot devices to kick in because the movie seemed to be coming to its conclusion fast thankfuly none of them were used the new hotel clerk did not do the usual called and told her what to do which is panic drop the phone and run out of the hotel without saying anything or question your boss and tell her she had to much to drink and just dismiss her was craven should do more of these types of movies also one last comment brian cox is in the movie but i had not one clue who he was i had to come over here to see that he is lisas father he is completely unrecognizable
2,the movie was gripping from start to finish and its bw photography of the american heartland is stunning we feel we are right there with them as they cross the big sky country and then into mexico and back to america again near the end of the movie the reflection of the rain on robert blake looks like small rivers of sweat and tears rolling down his face in the end we follow them up the stairway to their final moment br br the two criminals performed by robert blake and scott wilson as perry smith and dick hickock could be seen on any street in any town hickock is a smiling boy next door and smith the guy with stars in his eyes from the wrong side of town this point is made in the movie and it always surprises us that criminals are no different in appearance than anyone else evil even the most vile is part of the human condition these two delusional men kill an entire family looking for a safe that isnt there once on the run they start writing bad cheques carving out a trail for the authoritiesbr br there are many fine supporting actors i like john forsyth as the detective on the case alvin dewey also will geer shines in a brief but excellent scene as the prosecuting attorneybr br i have often wanted to see this movie all the way through having only caught it in short snatches i did finally get to it after buying the dvd the result is the finest classic crime movie i have ever seenbr br dont miss this brilliant movie to me this is what great filmmaking is all about
5,how much could the general hollywood director learn from this movie all when it comes to actually scaring people this movies truly shows that it is possible to really frighten and scare a viewer and that monstrous monsters and long knifes never will be the best way of achieving this all who love a real psychological thriller must see this movie it is the best of its kind
1,i have to be honest i was expecting a failure so bad because it really did sound like they were trying to milk the original movie to get money but that wasnt the case with this pretty funny sometimes odd movie i loved how they told the story of timon and pumba the story with simba and him having trouble sleeping was funny the jacuzzi bubble and when pumba leaves the bubbles stop its all harmless fun good for kids and some adults i think this movie will last for a while because it is rather good for a straight to video and dvd movie while the movie does seem a little odd and kind of trails off toward the end it works out of 10
2,i have to start saying it has been a long time since i have seen it but have seen it or more times a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musicalcomedy pairings of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence kay kysers mysteries would be a good examplebr br having spike jones unleashed is the best part of the show as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action doing a fine job of support hugh obrien plays the face buddy hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to lou costello and thus abbott and costello replacing the leads dont know if that was truebr br all in all a pleasant movie but important to have that much spike jones and his band on film for history wish that it was released as i havent seen or heard of it now in two decades hope it is not lost
6,hahahahafunnythat sums this movie up in one wordwhat the crap was this thingsince it might kill me to use the word moviei hope the directorwriterand producer didnt mean for this to turn out goodbecause it sure didnta scientist turning his son into a hammerhead sharkand the shark killing a bunch of people the scientist invited to the islandoh my goooooooddddi hate this film so much that when i was watching it i laughed at all the serious partsbecause they were so corny and unprofessionaland they couldnt have made the shark look more unrealisticeven though this thing had a bit larger budget than most lowbudget moviesall i have to say is watch this movie expecting to laugh at all the bad actingand stupid corny dialoguebecause if you are expecting a good movie youll be highly disappointed
0,given the opposite circumstance of 2009 where the reality is we do have a black president this movie takes on quite a powerful historical significance for entertainment value i found this movie to be both engaging and repugnant i was quite taken back of course by the blatant racism of the time but also found the music and dancing incredible also it is quite cool to see sammy davis jr as such a very young child actor he plays rufus jones a young boy who is being consoled by his mammy he is told why some day you could be president this was so ridiculous in 1933 that it was mocked and thought to be endearing charming and funny the bulk of the movie is a fantasy sequence of what the government would be like if it was run by a black man they depict the seats of government as being like a revivalist baptist churchbr br the fact was when i stumbled onto this movie one day it drew me in it is really well done and very entertaining i believe if we can look beyond the racism we can see this movie for all it brings us in fact to realize that it is not only not ridiculous to have a black president but that it is normal just makes this movie that much more relevant it clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness
4,this is not the typical mel brooks film it was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable leslie ann warren made the movie she is such a fantastic underrated actress there were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so but all in all this is worth the price to rent and see it the acting was good overall brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience again warren was the best actor in the movie but fume and sailor both played their parts well
3,it seems that it is becoming fashionable to rip basic instinct to the point that a significant part of the audience including critics found it terrible even before it was released it seems even more fashionable to trash sharon stone wholike all of usis now fourteen years older andunlike most of usstill looks wonderful first comments on this movie were so vicious that i had to see for myself in my opinion this sequel is not nearly as good as the original film but is not as bad as most comments pretend michael catonjones is not paul verhoeven neither henry bean and leora barish are joe eszterhas basic instinct is just an entertaining average thriller and besides the addition of jerry goldsmith original score keeps little resemblance to its predecessor even stone gives her character a different dimension creating a lustful devilish catherine trimell who can perfectly well rank among other monsters like hannibal lecter she is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of taking risks and can play with camp at her leisure unfortunately she seems to be the main target for those who enjoy trashing this flick she became too successful too much of a main icon and like all those actors who have reached that level her time has arrived and she is now bound to be destroyed by hollywood audiencesbr br the rest of the cast is outstanding giving performances that are far better than the material deserves david morrissey is a much better actor and by far more interesting than michael douglas his acting is flawless giving a dense complex dimension to an otherwise one dimensional character since he has more screen time and is the axis of the movie he can keep your attention from beginning to endbr br i am not recommending basic instinct as a great movie i am just expressing my disagreement with most of the comments on this site and my conviction that agendas other than the movie itself are shaping the opinion of most spectators
6,maggie smith and peter ustinov as a very unlikely couple in a very not likable film at allbr br the film shows promise for ustinov is released from prison for embezzling he convinces robert morley to go away so that he can assume his identity and begin hacking away at computers at a very fancy firm run by karl malden and bob newhart another unusual duo for filmsbr br morley sounds just as he did in 1938s marie antoinette perhaps he needed to return to that genrebr br this film is ridiculous at best hard to believe that the following year maggie smith totally changed her ways and gave a shattering oscar performance in the prime of miss jean brodiebr br ms smith is made out here to be an apparent dumbred head but by films end she is the brains of the outfit too bad the writing didnt go the way with her
4,does anyone happen to know where this film was shot the aviation scene on the cliff is beautiful it appears to be england however ivys apartment building certainly looks like the brill building with its fascinating elevatorsbr br charles mendl is listed as playing sir charles gage maybe i blinked but i never saw him perhaps he was the husbands lawyer but again i dont recall that character being in the film other than being mentioned as having made a phone call perhaps he was in the aviation scene or the ballroom scene did anyone spot himbr br herbert marshall was 57 years old when he shot this film
1,this typical mamet film delivers a quiet evenly paced insight into what makes a confidence man joe mantegna good explored as a psychological study by a noted psychologist lindsay crouse it slowly pulls her into his world with the usual nasty consequences the cast includes a number of the players found is several of mamets films steven goldstein jack wallace ricky jay andy potok allen soule william h macy and they do their usual good job i loved lindsay crouse in this film and have often wondered why she didnt become a more noted player than she has become perhaps im not looking in the right placesbr br the movie proceeds at a slow pace with flat dialog yet it maintains a level of tension throughout which logically leads to the bangup ending youd expect a real let down at the ending but i found it uplifting and satisfying i love this movie
5,when i was a kid of i always watched movies and television that i wasnt supposed to and this was one of them br br its one of my favorite movies of all time and it has to be the funniest movie i have ever seen in my life the acting is excellent they dont make comedies like this anymore these days movies that are actually funny and make you laugh without resorting to excrement or some type of vomitinducing body fluid as in those retarded judd apatow movies starring unfunny nonactors like seth rogen barfbr br this movie is a classic with actors who can actually act and deserve all the accolades
2,as a mother of young children who are or should i say have been growing up with the many reincarnations of scooby i feel well positioned to comment on the historical and current version of scoobybr br if as a family we had not seen any episodes prior to shaggy and scooby get a clue we may have enjoyed it as a light weight nothing special saturday morning cartoon but that in essence is the problem it is in its current format so light weight that it will not have the longevity of the old scooby and gang im sure it may succeed in a quick monetary return but im sure the long term buy in of old and young is in very real danger of being lost my year old son on seeing the new version was really disgruntled and without any prompting said that it looked really badly animated and why wasnt it anything like the last serieswhere are youbr br scrappy doo was an anomaly but still infinitely better than this lets hope get a clue will be apropos with reference to the producers
1,it would require the beauty and eloquence of shakespeare to do justice to this outstanding cinematic feat nevertheless ill give it a gobr br as far as adaptations of hamlet go this one is already at a better starting point than all other versions since it encompasses the entire play still this is no guarantee for a firstrate movie or even a good one usually im not much for movies that are overlong and the trend that seems to be prevalent in hollywood today namely that movies should be at least two hours long preferably three is one that hopefully wont last long few stories are strong enough to withstand such extensive exploration and could do with some cutting making a fourhourlong movie and keeping it interesting is no small undertaking but kenneth branagh pulls it off with flying colours he has managed to make a very long movie seem no more than any average movie i was completely engrossed from start to finishbr br the cast is excellent with kenneth branagh himself as the tormented prince giving a strong and memorable performance he manages to convey his feelings admirably through his voice and one does not have to be an expert on shakespearean verse to catch the myriad of emotions that are waging inside him kate winslet was a positive surprise i must say i didnt know what to expect really ive always liked her well enough as an actor but wasnt sure she could pull off playing shakespeare well she certainly eradicated all doubts with her performance she is the best ophelia i have seen and lent such depth to the character and was simply wonderful other brilliant performances are derek jacobi as claudius richard briers as polonius and nicholas farrell as horatio to name but a few i liked the fact that branagh used some internationally more famous stars to play in some of the minor roles i especially enjoyed the sparring between hamlet and the gravedigger played by billy crystalbr br the setting of the play in the 19th century gives a welcome change to the usually gloomier gothic settings it is overall much lighter than other versions ive seen more colourful and lavish but this does not distract from the tragedy of the play it is exceptional stylish and aesthetically pleasing a definite delight to the eye and other senses as well the music by patrick doyle is as always magical and thoroughly in tune with the movie one can only feel a deep sense of satisfaction after having seen this i am shocked and appalled that this exquisite work of art did not win an academy award for best picture even more so that it wasnt even nominated there is no way there was a better movie made that year or any other year for that matter this is as close to perfection as you can hope to getbr br to sum up a stunning work of pure genius and i cannot see how anyone could top this my hats off to you mr branagh
0,this show is beautifully done when it first came out i though it nothing more than a lighthearted family comedy with quite a few good oneliners it seemed to express many families really well too with different concepts of both parent and child however like i said i never thought any more of it then a good watch on an evening however my view was shot out the other window when the tragic death of the fantastically funny john ritter accrued the programme stood its ground and really commended the characters life in a very sensitive way that also touched the hearts of all the admire res of john ritter a fantastic actor with the talent to do anything when the show aired after ritters passing i really wanted to just give my dad a hug and let him know how much he meant to me i thought this shone threw the acting talents of the three children particularly that of bridgets character who was worried of the last words she said to him it reminded me that no matter what horrible things i say to my dad i dont mean them and its very important that he knows this great show
1,the danes character finally lets buddy have the awful truth leave me alone kiss men if you want to she screams selfrighteously in front of everyone thus destroying the man who has been in love with her for so long nice girl this might be the place to reconsider all of the giggly charm that danes pours into this character great reason to feel sympathy for her lying in bed and dying but hey remember there are no mistakes except maybe seeing this film br br wait a minute this irony is intended this is actually a masterpiece of ironic wit yes but somehow i doubt thats what the creators of this film had in mind sadly maybe there are a few mistakes after all
7,hands down the worst movie i have ever seen i thought nothing would ever dethrone last action hero but this does easily the movie is about single guys who meet on sundays to discuss their sexual escapades from the weekend a fourth guy  who is married and  that used to be a part of the group shows up and talks about what he and his wife do nothing works in this movie the jokes are not funny but they are repeated throughout the movie the big kicker at the end of the movie is laughable avoid at all costs
0,years ago when i was a poor teenager my best friend and my brother both had a policy that the person picking the movie should pay and while i would never pay to see some of the crap they took me to i couldnt resist a free trip to the movies thats how i came to see crap like the second conan movie and never say never again now despite this being a wretched movie it is in places entertaining to watchin a brain dead sort of way and technically the stunts and camerawork are good so this elevates my rating all the way to a so why is the movie so bad well unlike the first rambo movie this one has virtually no plot rambo himself only says about words other than grunts and yells there is a needless and completely irrelevant and undeveloped romance and the movie is one giant and stupid special effect and what stupifyingly awful special effects while 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are shot at rambo none have any effect on him and almost every bullet or arrow rambo shoots hits its mark and while the bad guys are using ak47s helicopters and rockets in some scenes all rambo had is a bow and arrows with what seem like nuclearpowered tips the scene where the one bad guy is shooting at him as he slowly and calmly launches one of these exploding arrows is particularly made for dumb viewers it was wonderfully parodied in uhf starring weird al plus hot shots part deux also does a funny parody of the genrenot just this stupid scenebr br allinall a movie so dumb and pointless its almost like selfparody
1,friz frelengs rumours is an excellent private snafu cartoon that warns against spreading panicinducing rumours during wartime produced as were all the snafu shorts to be shown to military audiences as entertaining instructional films rumours is extremely imaginative and crams tons of ideas into its very brief lifespan when snafu starts a rumour about a bombing it escalates into an eventual rumour that america has lost the war this is illustrated brilliantly by way of a long rubbery piece of baloney and several strange fictional creatures who come back to haunt snafu with ever more terrible news about his countrys military rumours is inventive fast paced and funny all of which help to overshadow the rather laboured dont badmouth the military message it stands up as one of the best of the private snafu shorts
2,this really doesnt do the blues justice it starts out badly with images from the voyager probe and blind willie mctell or was it blind lemon jefferson someone blind anyway apparently narrating from outer space  and telling us the life stories of various blues musicians corny as it is this might be the visually most interesting part of this documentary afterwards the only thing to see is actors incompetently mouthing the classic tunes filmed in fake 20s black and white intercut with the likes of beck and shemekia copeland raping the same songs afterwards this is a good device to show us why the old blues greats were really so great but it doesnt make for compelling viewing there is hardly anything in here that could justify making it a film and not a radio play nobody should be forced to see these badly done reenactments its a shame for wenders scorsese and especially for the blues avoid at all costs
5,did anyone else feel as betrayed as i did the first hour or so was pretty solid but the last oh my god it seemed like it was predictable and cheesy not grandiose and epic like the entire run of the show has been most reviews have read have been glowing but i really cant understand why i had seriously predicted that general ending way earlier on but then retracted it because i thought no they would never do that thats far too lame i can hardly stand it i feel so unsatisfied i think im about to walk out the door to go sell every season i own someone please change my mind i want to love this so bad someone tell me why im wrong great show terrible ending
7,its a bad movie it seems like there is only police in hk they were not using there gun and this makes me feel like a jacky chans movie all the time they were using their gun to point at the suspect only when they finally use their gun is when they kill each other what a funny movie in the movie its like all the good guys died without a reasonbr br they story line of the movie also sucks the story jump here and there and bored people but if you wanted to see a bloody movie i think this is only a ok type of movie i think us made zombie movie is more bloodier than this one

0,the clouded yellow is a compact psychological thriller with interesting characterizations barry jones and kenneth more are both terrific in supporting roles in characters that both have more to them than what meets the eye jean simmons is quite good and trevor howard makes a fascinatingly offbeat suspense hero
1,to call this anything at all would be an insult to everything else some expletives might describe it but still too positively normally one ignores this kind of rubbish but it was so stupid that one can but despair would have though that even americans and commercial tvstations would have given this piece of st a miss but as the germans say gegen die dummheit kaempfen die goetter selbst vergebens
3,its one of those dramas thats so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny the script is absolutely dire direction appalling lighting purely armature the only thing letting it down from a true so bad its good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard but doesnt at least destroy any speeches theres continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout and finally last but not least the acting is appalling for a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this
3,republic pictures comes late in the game to the werewolf er werecat genre the plot has a writer returning to paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed jungle fear during which he had blackouts he is arriving to great acclaim as his novel that parallels an infamous trial is a best seller the french government wants to know if he had access to secret documents something that seems more likely when an official is killed by a catman suspicion really falls on the writer when his fianc ends up dead complicating matters is the return of the blackouts so the writer doesnt know if hes the killer or notbr br okay thriller is much too leisurely to be fully enjoyed there are too many musical numbers early on and too much dead time when things are all talk in the middle and later sections the acting is fine and the sets quite good but there is a reason why most people i know only remember the top hatted killer hes the most interesting thing in this film despite its short running time just over an hour i think the reason that this film was rarely seen on tv was that after 20 minutes you begin to lose patience with it as good as the talk is i just wished someone would do something when it finally did happen in the closing minutes it was too little too latebr br take a pass

7,this film is famous for several qualities a literate script for once in partlyreligious filmmaking by philip dunne some very good performances a firstrate production in every department and its intelligent direction by veteran henry king if one were making a film then getting such talents as leon shamroy as cinematographer lyle wheeler as art director and alfred newman as composer of original music would guarantee a quality production add the cast of this film including gregory peck and susan hayward as the title characters james robertson justice raymond massey kieron moore jayne meadows and john sutton plus a dance by gwen verdon and expectations might be raised that the resulting film could be made into something special but in a biblical subject script usually a subgenre prone to illogical motivations and miraculous interventions everything would ultimately depend on the authors skills philip dunne here has supplied human beings a rare achievement in biblical films david is a man in this film manysided not someone doing mythical deeds on paper in the old testament gregory peck makes him curious passionate selfcontrolled selfdeprecating and appealing as bathsheba hayward is scarcely the perfect choice but conveys a good deal of commonsense earthiness and emotional normalcy that helps one see why the king of israel would risk so much for her the rest of the cast is stalwart and capable by turns the familiar storyline provides them little to work with but author dunne and the cast do as much as is possible with the human situations davids youth is told in flashback how he was chosen by a prophet of yahweh to be king of israel and earns his way to be second to the king saul by defeating goliath the phiiistine in battle when all else are afraid to beard the giant warrior thereafter he finally is driven from the court of king saul of israel becomes a famous warrior and returns to claim the kingdom and become the instrument of death of jonathan the kings son formerly a friend his wars are successful the film opens in fact with a successful attack scene but his life is empty since his wife michal jayne meadows is sauls daughter and is cold to him he turns to bathsheba whom he sees from the palace roof bathing naked later she admits she had hoped he would see her but she has a husband uriah when she becomes pregnant it becomes necessary for uriah to come in from the battlefield and spend time at home he instead asks david to set him in the forefront of the battle even after being aroused by verdons dance david agrees he is killed a war hero but this does not solve the infidelity question drought comes to israel and the kings infidelity is blamed for the phenomenon at last david places his hands on the ark of the covenant recently brought to jerusalem and housed in a temple which has caused the death of others who accidentally came in contact with it inviting his god to punish himand nothing happensdavid exits the temple and finds that rain has come to his parched land this film is always interesting varied in its types of scenes and physically beautiful the director and author make use of the observer principle and are frankly more successful in humanizing the characters than in almost any film outside the grecianized near eastern canon wherein the feat is a bit easier since neither miraculous nor religious themes are made central in such adventures  wellremembered for its glowing realization fine performances and intelligent dialogue this dramatic effort bears repeated study
0,baseketball is awesome its hilarious and so damned funny that you will wet your pants laughing i have seen it so many times i have stopped counting but everytime it gets funnierbr br trust me on this onebaseketball is a surefire hit and i loved it and will continue to love it i hope one day there will be a special edition dvd brought outbr br ten thumbs up
1,this is a runofthemill nature porn movie by porn i dont mean sex i mean gratuitous images of for example thousands of birds together or hundreds of walruses or a giant waterfall or iceberg several of the shots in the film seem to exist solely to make their way into the trailer to get people into theatres to see it for all of ten seconds before it disappears never to be seen again for the rest of the filmbr br there is almost no plot in this film told to expect a story of three animal families better than march of the penguins the movie simply doesnt deliver the blame rests in three key areas the writers who gave james earl jones some of the worst lines to narrate in nature film history the music team who overdramatized everything to tell you what you should be feeling even when the film fails to motivate and lastly but most importantly the editors who had the story jump from place to place with no rhyme or reason no continuity no flow sucking the life out of the entire film  a film about life when we got to the whales halfway through the film i sunk back in my seat with dread hoping against hope that the film was more than halfway through and that id be able to survive the long endurance test along with the animals on screenbr br there was also almost no science in the film at all they attributed hot and cold all of it not just the seasons solely to the earths tilt ignoring the fact that wed have even greater extremes from location to location if there was no tilt because the poles would never warm and it would be worst if we had no rotation relative to revolution like mercury because half the planet would bake and the other half would freeze then near the end they used the phrase humans and animals as if humans are not animals somehow exempt from the laws of nature so much for sciencebr br i must credit the camera work however and again that is why i call this nature porn everything from superslowmotion to what appears to be a finelytuned mechanicallycontrolled timelapse photography was put to use to provide some and i caution only some stunning moments that do raise the bar compared to other nature films that said i am not convinced that it was all nature on the screen some of the shots showing the great watering hole in africa as it changed from season to season seemed like cgi to me a director might have expected such suspicion and built in other shots to demonstrate that its all natural but they didnt do thatbr br for a film about earth i had expected a lot more of earth to be shown what we saw was pristine we had to take the narrators word for it that some species are at risk due to climate changes they didnt show us evidence of it they didnt show us albertas poisonous tailing ponds visible from space they didnt show us the great pacific trash whorl they didnt show us a nighttime picture of human light pollution around the planet these are as much earth as anything else why cover it up for a feelgood whitewash br br my last criticism of the content is of predation any time a predator was shown on the screen actually hunting prey the music turned almost into that mt doom scene from lord of the rings with the predator portrayed as some kind of sauron ultimateevil character but predators arent evil they perform a necessary service ensuring that the best members of the prey species survive we are predators ourselves any time the predator caught the prey we immediately cut away to something else to sort of pretend that death and eating dont really happen the final insult was the dad polar bear being left to die after he dared to try to eat bad bear bad you can almost hear them saybr br on to the presentation itself my theatre may be in part to blame for this but maybe not i had expected to see something with greater clarity than i could see on my own hdtv lcd at home but the picture was blurry and was presented in the same 169 ratio i could get at home instead of the wider ratio many films come in these days and during one actionpacked scene near the end the film i cant imagine this happening digitally from how it looked was damaged and we lost several of the colors eventually blacking out completely that repeated about three timesbr br if they actually do plant a tree on my behalf it will have been worth it but how will i know
7,this is a fascinating filmespecially to old movie buffs and historians i am both during the first half of the twentieth century sadly black americans were usually not allowed into white theaters as a result theaters catering to black audiences wanted to show films reflecting the black experience and showing black actors in many cases the films were essentially similar plotwise to standard hollywood fare but with a much much lower budgetand usually horrid production values you really cant fault the film makersthey just didnt have the money and resources available to the average film company as a result they had to make due with a lot lessincluding an overreliance on stock actors that were seen again and again no money for reshooting scenes and a need to get the films done fast this film tried very hard to be a black version of a gene autry filmstarring herb jeffries instead jeffries was a lightskinned man from mixed ancestry and he starred in several similar cowboy films in each he sings a little fights a little though very poorly and loves a littleeverything you need in a cowboy believe it or not jeffries is still alive at age 96br br the general plot was indiscernible from an autry picturecomplete with anachronistic items such as telephones out west the problem is that despite its similarities the low budget shines through stymie from the lil rascals flubbed a few lines but they just left it in the fight scenes were totally unchoreographed and were among the worst ever put on film there were some odd plot holes there was no background music leaving the film strangely quiet and the acting was pretty awfulbr br now this does not mean that the film isnt worth seeingonly that it abouts with technical problems that prevent it from being scored higher one reviewer oddly scored this film a 10 how this can be with all the problems is beyond me however i can understand a person liking the film despite its many problems the plot is generally pretty good the characters likable the musical numbers excellent and you know that the people making the film tried so darn hard and its a very important piece of american history but a 10 br br by the way in an odd bit of casting the very tall lean and almost whiteskinned jefferies is paired with short dumpy and exceptionally dark mantan morelandas his brother also spencer williams may be familiar to you he played andy on tvs amos n andy
5,this is one of the most guilty pleasure movies everbr br i am embarrassed to say that my favorite character is tish but still enjoy watching her make her space outfit like super cool with a like totally bitchin belt and stick on rhinestones on her facebr br but anyways the movie is actually one of the few family movies that holds your interest i know that the begining drags particuarly if you know what is going to happen but the second half is probably one of the most nerve wracking segments in a family filmbr br i wouldnt stand up in front of millions of people and proclaim to love this movie in fact renting it is pretty embarrassing itself but ill admit it here with the internet to hide behindbr br 
5,notable because of its notorious explicit scene when the gorgeous maruschka detmers takes her young lovers penis from his trousers and into her mouth even without this moment the film is a splendid if slightly disturbing passionate and blindingly sexy ride detmers puts in a great performance as the partly deranged insatiable delight wandering about her flat nude dressed partly dressed and naked she steals most of the film about love sexual passion philosophy and politics for me the last two get a little lost and the ending is most confusing when her fianc is released whilst fellow terrorists are released she seems uncertain as to who she wants and the young lover seems more interested in his exams than anything else as she weeps beautifully of course
2,me and my friend rented this movie for 250 and we both agree on one thingbr br this is the worst movie ever madebr br also me and my friend counted 475 face shots which makes up 95 of the moviebr br so in other words do see this movie unless you like wasting money and i dobr br 
3,i was babysitting a family of three small children for a night and their mother gave me this to show for them having just grabbed it at walmart earlier in the week all three children actually got physically ill while watching it im pretty sure it was the pizza they ate or something they all had picked up from school but really it could have been this film absolutely disgusting how any one can produce this caliber of trash is beyond me fortunately i turned off the film when i noticed the children were not responding and acting strangely for any parents out there i strongly advise you to refrain from letting young children view this movie
5,french horror cinema has seen something of a revival over the last couple of years with great films such as inside and switchblade romance bursting on to the scene malfique preceded the revival just slightly but stands head and shoulders over most modern horror titles and is surely one of the best french horror films ever made malfique was obviously shot on a low budget but this is made up for in far more ways than one by the originality of the film and this in turn is complimented by the excellent writing and acting that ensure the film is a winner the plot focuses on two main ideas prison and black magic the central character is a man named carrre sent to prison for fraud he is put in a cell with three others the quietly insane lassalle body building transvestite marcus and his retarded boyfriend daisy after a short while in the cell together they stumble upon a hiding place in the wall that contains an old journal after translating part of it they soon realise its magical powers and realise they may be able to use it to break through the prison wallsbr br black magic is a very interesting topic and im actually quite surprised that there arent more films based on it as theres so much scope for things to do with it its fair to say that malfique makes the best of its assets as despite its restraints the film never actually feels restrained and manages to flow well throughout director eric valette provides a great atmosphere for the film the fact that most of it takes place inside the central prison cell ensures that the film feels very claustrophobic and this immensely benefits the central idea of the prisoners wanting to use magic to break out of the cell  its very easy to get behind them its often said that the unknown is the thing that really frightens people and this film proves that as the director ensures that we can never really be sure of exactly what is round the corner and this helps to ensure that malfique actually does manage to be quite frightening the film is memorable for a lot of reasons outside the central plot the characters are all very interesting in their own way and the fact that the book itself almost takes on its own character is very well done anyone worried that the film wont deliver by the end wont be disappointed either as the ending both makes sense and manages to be quite horrifying overall malfique is a truly great horror film and one of the best of the decade  highly recommended viewing
5,before films like the texas chainsaw massacre suspiria and halloween changed the view of horror forever there was a more gothic and far less violent era in the genre films like the hammer horror series and rosemarys baby were what scared and thrilled audiences throughout the 60s and early 70s i cant tell you how many times i rented this film during my childhood but i did because there was something about it i didnt want to limit myself to the slasher and zombies movies of the 70s and 80s and films like this production from the famous but sadly long gone amicus film company were a good startbr br pros a grand eerie music score strong performances from a stellar cast brilliant cinematography plenty good old fashioned thrills and chills especially in the first and last vignettes some haunting moments and images moves at a slow but stead pace the house is one spooky oppressive dwelling great production design and set decoration which give the film a real old gothic horror feel depends more on mood and bloodless chills than on gore and gratuitous nudity for its thrillsbr br cons some pacing issues in the first half aside from the the cloak the rest of the stories feel like theyve been done before clichs galore the second story waxworks has fine acting and its moments but is the weakest of the four in terms of scares and suspense the low budget really shows at timesbr br final thoughts after seeing this film for the first time in many years i can see why i rented it so frequently its not a masterpiece by any means but its a good example of a time when horror films were made with style and class watch this one with the lights offbr br my rating 355
0,this film once sensational for its forwardthinking politics and depictions of free love and sexual liberation has been reduced by time to a mere curiosity it seems absurd now that this mostly boring little film had been banned and seized by governments in many countries given how socialistic sweden eventually became the radicalism of its politics once controversial appear naive and almost mainstream four decades later and its sex scenes at one time the subject of sensational obscenity trials look pretty tame in a modern context nevertheless the film and accompanying documentaries detailing its many controversies and influences remains marginally watchable as an early reliquary of 60s youth rebellion one part of the film that still holds up its selfconsciousness with respect to the fourth wall every once in a while the filmmakers film themselves making the film the satiric playfulness of this still elicits a chuckle
0,in what seemed like the longest 1hour 35 ive had to endure in a long time al pacino delivers an accurate performace to be sure not his usual typecasting which was nice but his character was just truely pathetic someone to pitty as he stumbles around forgetting appointments as we realise that the hollywood social life has drained him of his life energy but in this movie we needed someone to like and for some reason every character in the picture said i dont know why i like you eli to al pacinos chracter and i couldnt even come close to liking himbr br all the other actors played their usual styles tea leoni richard schiff and bill nunn did nothing to change their established personas developed on tv or in earlier films and kim basinger wasnt even in the film long enough to deliver a performance of any kindbr br the movies story had no momentum most scenes never driving the story forward but rather just collecting factoids about characters which later came into play in an anticlimactic ending it had potential except for their unwillingness to build upon the storybr br whats the point of the film daniel algrant and jon robin baitz would have you believe once hollywood has you you cant get out yeah right and thats why so many people get fired in hollywood
0,that magical moment in life that point between the beautiful innocence of childhood and the confusing whirlwind that marks adulthood    this is what this movie is all about br br danni wonderfully played by reese witherspoon is right at that moment in life when the movie starts she swoons over elvis playing his records and wishfully thinking about love maureen her sister will soon be off to college has no trouble with attracting boys is beautiful and seems to have it all figured out although she doesnt she dates a local loser whos father is also after her and just wishes she could find a decent boy and be swept off her feet danni like most young teenagers wishes she could be anyone else but herself because most teenagers think that who they are just isnt good enough she wants to be maureen but doesnt see that she is beautiful herselfbr br the moment adulthood begins to intrude itself upon her life is when she meets court foster for the first time court whos father has recently died has moved to their old farm to work it with his mother and two younger brothers he has been thrust responsibility when he should be having fun on one particular hot day he goes to the pond and jumps in only to find danni skinny dipping they yell and argue and danni leaves but they see each other a day later when courts mother is invited to dannis to visit old friendsdannis parents danni becomes attracted to court and court to danni she is a tomboy and is spunky has attitude and says whats on her mind br br court is 17 and danni 14 and he knows it but they continue to grow closer with their days at the pond between court working the farm by the time court kisses her one day danni is smitten dannis father tells her to invite court to the house and he does but things are uncomfortable for court on his sort of date the silence though is broken by his meeting with maureen who has yet to see court one look between the two and its all over the looks of pain and defeat on dannis face are both beautiful in their trueness to life and painful at the same time the rest of the movie i will not tell but the movie has more to it than a relationship between a boy and two sistersbr br the greatness of the movie is in its depiction of lifes moments both beautiful and painful and the relationship between two sisters whose love is tested by both a boy that they love and the pain they must endure both together and individually danni eventually marks her entrance into the world when she sees that the world is unfair painful and maybe even a little less hopeful than when the movie started few movies can truly capture the wonder of childhood and the pain of adulthood so perfectly this movie has since the first time i watched it stuck in my mind its in the my top 100 movie list and deservedly so i only wish more movies like this were made because if so    my faith in hollywood would be a lot better
3,what another reviewer called lack of character development i call understatement the movie didnt bash one over the head with overexplanation or unnecessary backstory yes there were many untold stories that we only got a glimpse of but this was primarily a oneday snapshot into an event that catalyzed change in all of the characters lives henry thomass performance was a really lovely study in the power of acting that focuses on reaction rather than action good rental

4,warning may contain spoilers my huge problem with this movie is how totally selfcentered and self consumed the adulteress wife is after having a one night stand with a slimy psycho she is being stalked by him he calls her constantly and threatens her and even sends a video of their night together he is obviously crazy and very dangerous the problem is she only thinks he is dangerous to her and exposing her secret not for one second did she ever have one thought of concern for her husband did she even for a moment think of him possibly being in danger from this psychotic as soon as she realized how mental he was she should have warned her husband no matter what the consequences maybe there wouldnt have been a movie then but there really wasnt one anyway so whats the difference
1,understand im reviewing the film i have seen i realize virtually all the nudity and gore was cut from this film thus neutering it completely when seeing names like ginger lynn and jenna jameson attached i knew i wasnt going to get a horror classic but at the very least i expected gratuitous boobies and bloodshed but no this has got to be the most butchered modern horror film i mean its easy to tell there is much more to certain scenes but they suddenly cut away or the scene just totally ends right as it begins how does one screw up cannibals and porn stars i mean thats a winning formula it makes me wonder if the director slept with some executives wife or something because it is literally amazing how much got cut from this reading about it a few years back in fangoria i was excited it looked like a fun film but unfortunately the true film is locked in a vault somewhere and we must endure this piece of excrement retitled evil breed hopefully an unrated cut will be released someday as i think a good movie exists in this mess but until then best grab a twelve pack of bud cause thats the only way youll make it through this movie
0,the only redeeming quality of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comedic everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry drop out i have actually seen better acting in low budget porn i though i had actually rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene jim watch your ass nick you watch yours together i wont leave you behindbr br the first action sequence shows how awful the production is but its really kind of funny good guys have transformer weapons in one scene they all have fake hk mp5 submachine guns next scene ak47 replicas and then to top it all off they do some weapon swapping between scenes with a couple of m16s i think they had a budget shortage for guns not enough to go around between the good guys and bad guys fight scenes are poorly coordinated and fake as all hell you have to remove the pinspoon from a grenade for it to explode on its own you cant fire a shoulder launched missile of any kind while riding inside a helicopter weapons that you throw away dont suddenly reappear when a gun is out of bullets throwing it away is still pretty stupid unless you have no idea how to reload them big slow trucks driving around in first gear make for awkward action scenes i really cant believe movies like this are actually produced this movie would be hilarious on nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk
3,i saw this film first in the soviet union and many erotic scenes were simply edited out by the censorship committee but then in poland in 2000 i watched it in a complete form and so what the plot is incredibly unwise  men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of feminist strong straight and fundamentally severe ladies the men now try to fight it and then the whole bunch of extremely silly clichs follow  sexdrive constant masculine desire for sex feminists who are shown like complete idiots you may agree with them or not but idiots certainly they are not and so on the performance even of the stellar jerzy stuhr is here wooden and strangely bad  he just pulls unfunny faces and repeats on saying phrases like i am in the elevator with a nude chick and i havent done anything to her this was intended to be a comedy instead it turned out to be a vapid farce full of predictable jokes and belowthewaist innuendos do not waste your time on it  this is just bad
0,watched this on dvd in original language with english subs either the subtitling was very poor or the actual dialog doesnt make much of story and give any character development there are quite a few hk stars in this but the movie doesnt need their presence to make it better or worse its just bad the bright and colorful scenes done in cg are attractive for the sheer colors and brilliance but it can get overwhelming before long if anything this makes me think of a childs movie with its nonstop barrage of cg fight scenes and crap plot im certain i grasped what took place in the film but the whole delivery of the story was rather lousy
6,this film is really terrible terrible as in it is a waste of 84 minutes of your life special effects are so terrible the acting wasnt convincingbr br its about a crocodile that attack a view tourists as they are filming a documentary about blood surfing blood surfing is when they surf around sharks but it turns terrible wrong when a 31 foot crocodile interrupts there holiday the sharks dont look real the crocodile is even worse and it gets even more pathetic when they are running away form the creature but the crocodile gets stuck and females flash it the deaths are fake and the pirates are just to fill in timebr br a pointless terrible film thats not worth seeing
4,well i can and will be very short this is a wrongbalanced nonconvincing film that could have been a little bit better the script seems to not know which way to go  from funny to clichewise serious its a bit silly that plus too much sentences we have heard before the hacker is in florida or no he is in madrid no he is in   he is screwing the signal br br out of 10
0,you may consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be spoilersbr br im sorry but spielberg didnt deserve to win any oscar for this piece and i think the academy was right in that vote other oscars for best actor nominations and such that i dont know about but it would be hard to justify given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product the way spielberg directs this is so contrived so meddlesome while watching this movie a distinction made during a film as art course i have taken was screaming at me sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered sentimentality is sugary and unreal a false view of life this is overthetop sentimentality when in real life to two people ever begin to read out loud in synchronicity as celie and shug avery do when sitting on the bed going over the letters from nettie they have found there are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the film all the men crowding around miss millies car and then jumping in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she goes to drive away harpo falling through the roofs of various buildings hes working on a cheap slapstick gag the whole troop of revelers heading from the jook joint en masse to the chapel as if magically entranced by the choirs singing on and on nothing rings true i even wondered if harpos name was chosen purposefully because its his wife sophias real name oprah backwards spielberg isnt above such cutenessbr br its not that spielberg is incapable of honestly rendered action and emotion schindlers list was amazing deeply touching for me and i greatly admire saving private ryan too for its realism even if the story is a bit contrived
5,why on earth should you explore the mesmerizing nature documentary earth how much time do you have on earth so i can explain this to you ok i will not elongate my review exploration on earth to infinity but i must stand my ground on why this is a must see the documentary takes a nature round trip on the migration paths on three animal families a female polar bear and her cubs with the real life subplot of the father bear daring it out to hunt for food in his isolated path a mama of a whale with her baby whale taking a whale of a migration tour for prey and an elephant mama with her small maybe not so small they are elephants offspring migrating in africa directors alastair forthegill  mark linfield did an out of this earth job in also capturing the survival skills of many other animal species besides the magnetic shots of our three animal family protagonists the cinematographically skilled team of richard brooks burton mike holding adam ravetch and andrew shillabeer were animales in camera shooting the wondrous nature sites and animal instinctive behaviors not to mention the slomo animal prey shots were u n b e l i e a v a b l e earth is also a lesson learner on the global warming effect on the animals the papa polar bear in the doc is the poster animal boy on that consequence so fellow earthlings it is time to take the documentary voyage to visit earth today  good
5,i bought this while i was playing chess in hastings i am from denmark though it is very good definitely with an understanding of the horror genre the monster towards the end is very scary people who criticise this on imdb should recall that it was a huge succes among serious horror criticsbr br 
1,i cant remember many details about the show but i remember how passionate i was about it and how i was determined not to miss any episodes unfortunately at the time we had no vcr so i havent ever seen the series again however i can remember strongly how i felt while watching it and how thrilled i was every time it came on sam waterstone was my favorite actor these days i think i was almost in love and he remains one of my favorite actors to the day mostly due to his appearance in the series i would gladly buystealdownload this series i think i would go to great lengths in order to see it again and revisit a childhood long gone any ideas does anybody knows of a site devoted to the series or has the episodes on tape from their first airing
4,666 the child starts as a plane crashes the only survivor of flight 666 was a young boy named donald boo boo stewart who is adopted by news reporter erika sarah lieving  her cameraman husband scott lawson adam vincent after they covered the incident for channel news at first donald seems like any normal kid but death seems to follow him around after warnings from a nun  vicar scott begins to believe that donald is evil  the cause of all the deathsbr br this straighttodvd horror flick was directed by jake perez under the pseudonym jake jackson  one has to say 666 the child is really rather poor whenever i see the asylum is responsible for a film i get worried i get very worried since their track record is awful they seem to specialise in making or distributing low budget horror films which are usually ripoffs of some recent successful big budget horror film  in the case of 666 the child you dont need a degree in rocket science to realise that its a complete ripoff to cash in on the recent the omen 2006 which was released the same year the script by benjamin henry  austin laurel is terrible  simply cant match the ambitions of the the hollywood equivalent i mean just what exactly does donald the antichrist expect to achieve from a middle class family in a small town its hardly a great starting point to bring about the destruction of thew world is it every character in 666 the child is some form of the main characters from the omen the adopted parents the priest who tries to warn them  the sinister babysitter theres a real lack of incident theres barely any gore  the plot is poor i mean donald killing a dentist because they were trying to fix his teeth is just so random  needless what were all the disgusting pictures donald drew all about where did the babysitter come from  theres just nothing that ties everything together  its just a disjointed mess that just becomes very boring very quickly the references to the number also becomes annoying  are very unsubtlebr br director perez does alright i suppose its competent if nothing else theres virtually no blood or gore theres a few sprays of blood a cut off hand  someone gets a circular saw stuck in their face but it sounds a lot better than it looks on screen its certainly not scary theres no atmosphere thanks to a throughly bland contemporary setting in a suburban house  theres no tension because we never really know what donald is trying to do  there fore theres no threat from himbr br technically the film is alright its reasonably well made but since the actual film is so poor it makes little difference the acting isnt that great but at the same time ive seen worsebr br 666 the child is a poor mans the omen ripoff id sooner watch either the original or the remake over this any day of the week not good  definitely not recommended followed by the sequel 666 the beast 2007 which also went straighttodvd
2,as a guy who has seen all the seasons i can say that jg constantly surprises me i mean after you saw him shifting from laughter to paranoia instantly throughout the seasons and after every little gesture of his made u believe he is a gangster u thought to yourself ok he is a good actor and he can get into a gangsters skin but after seeing him opening his eyes and struggling for his life i mean i could almost feel the pain he made us believe he was going through i was so touched by his performance that i immediately thought at robert de niro marlon brando and al pacino these guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more but nowadays they are either old or dead brando and its ok that they make less movies and their performances are lighter than they used to be i cant wait to see gandolfini in other movies where he delivers a totally different role can u recommend me some of his older movies where he gives a memorable performance
0,six degrees had me hooked i looked forward to it coming on and was totally disappointed when men in trees replaced its time spot i thought it was just on hiatus and would be back early in 2007 what happened all my friends were really surprised it ended we could relate to the characters who had real problems we talked about each episode and had our favorite characters there wasnt anybody on the show i didnt like and felt the acting was superb i alway like seeing programs being taped in cities where you can identify the local areas i for one would like to protest the canceling of this show and ask you to bring it back and give it another chance give it a good time slot dont keep moving it from this day to that day and advertise it so people will know it is on
3,this movie is funny and suitable for any age it is definitely familytype entertainment the cast does a fine job playing folks in the midwestern town of big bean illinois where we must assume nothing ever happens since the excitement preinvasion of the decade is the new and only exit ramp from the interstate the location appeals as suitably boring and totally unlikely for the invasion of earth by martians but these martians are totally inept despite being wellequipped with an arsenal of suitably ghastly and deadly weapons including one set on eradicating the martians too the martians deadpan their lines and throw in just the right accents to make us the viewers and the locals wish to help them leave earth j j anderson playing the very young halloween carnivorous duck has just great lines watch this movie for laugher and entertainment thoughtprovoking it isnt but subtle and enjoyable it is
6,this movie has an all star cast john candy richard lewis ornella mutti cybill shepard and jim belushi to name a few run amuck in monte carlo as well as some other beautiful european locations and is very funny the trouble that everyone gets in when they lie to protect themselves is great and i highly recommend that you see this movie it is well worth it john candy is in top form in once upon a crime as is everyone else if you and your family are looking for a great family film this is your ticket everyone gives stellar performances great acting great comedy and great timing which is rare in movies these days great plot great mystery which i love anyways and overall well worth the money you spend on it so get the kids grab some popcorn juice or tea or sodas and enjoy the show
2,elephant walk was a thoroughly dull film and i really was quite happy when finally a herd of elephants stormed through the mansion and ended this film considering the money and cast youd sure expect the film to be a lot better though i also question the odd casting of dana andrews as a man who is in love with elizabeth taylor its not just the age difference but i just cant see the pair as a couple perhaps some of this may be the fault of substituting miss taylor for vivian leigh at the last minute due to miss leighs deteriorating mental conditionthough i also have a hard time visualizing andrews and leigh as well in addition for an english woman miss taylor doesnt even seem to try using an accentbr br the film begins with peter finch and taylor meeting and marrying in england their plan is to return to finchs tea plantation in ceylon sri lanka and at first it seems like a good life however there are no women to talk with and the household staff seem to resent her on top of that once back home finch behaves like a boorish jerk and taylor is miserable neighbor andrews can see this and he declares his undying passion for her however taylor isnt yet ready to abandon her marriage but through the course of the film finch treats liz more and more like an object and finally she is ready to leavewhen out of the blue cholera strikes the plantation so its up to andrews finch and taylor to work together to save the daythough by this point i really didnt care as there is absolutely no chemistry between the characters the dialog is pretty dull and you cant understand why taylor didnt leave her weasel husband within days of arriving in this inhospitable hellbr br the film isnt particularly engaging or convincing and despite a decent budget by paramount the film is a sluggish mess i particularly was surprised that although the film appeared to be filmed on location many scenes were clearly filmed in a studio with a rear projected and grainy shot that wasnt integrated well in one scene for instance taylor finch and the lot are sitting on the veranda and the grass is bright green then when the picture cuts to people dancing right in front of them the grass is brown its clear they really are not in ceylon in this scene or the scene with the giant reclining buddha my advice is to skip this one or at least keep a pot of coffee nearby to keep you awake despite its budget its just not a very good or inspired filmbr br by the way could miss taylor have been pregnant during part of this film in some scenes particularly at the beginning shes wearing billowy clothes has a doublechin and looks puffy this isnt a criticismafter all women do get pregnant but if you look carefully youll see what i meanbr br also by the way the basic plot in many ways is similar to gianta great taylor film indeed its amazing how casting and decent direction can do so much
7,this is quite possibly the worst acting i have ever seen in a movie ever and what is up with the casting the leading lady in this movie has some kind of nose disfiguration and is almost impossible to look at for any period of time without becoming fixated on her nose you could go to your local grocery store on a sunday afternoon and easily find 50 more qualified better looking possible leading ladies i made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because it had a cool dvd case this movie looks like it is just some class project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical college i would rather have spent the hour or so that this movie was on watching public access television at least the special effects are better and the people on there are more attractive than anyone you will see in this film
5,first let me say that before sunrise like all movies is not a movie for all tastes it appears some folks are less smart to acknowledge this fact but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie generates from some people for me like most folks here before sunrise struck a deep chord in me i was truly stunned moved inspired by it this is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing it creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine it is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings i got from itbr br the movie works as a communion of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other it is very intelligent and inspiring not so much in how one conversation necessarily ties into the next or the significance of the topics of jesse and celines discussions but rather the little nuances the perfectly articulate responses they provoke from each other it captures an honest romantic yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime viennese milieu it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world and what happens after that night is open for debate but i never doubt that they wont each other againbr br the facile comments by rockythebear and the below user are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire dissenter unwilling to accept and respect those who love this moviebr br see it and it may change your way of life
0,the film is side spliting from the outset eddie just seems to bring that uniqueness to the stage and makes the most basic thing funny from having an ice cream as a child to the long old tradition of the family get together the film is very rare in this country but unsure of availability in other countries i have searched through a lot of web sites and still no luck phoned companies that search for rare videos and there are year waiting lists for it so hints are very welcome if any one likes eddie murphy as a comedian and sees the video get itit is worth the money and cant go far wrong
1,first things first i was never once scared of this underrated gem as a kid little mermaid on the other hand as my title says this was one of my fav childhood movies that i still love as a teenager its a beautiful bittersweet movie about a misfit german shepherd called charlie fantasticaly voiced by burt reynolds who is killed by his bosspartner in crime is name haha is carface charlie is sent straight to heaven by default because all dogs go to heaven because unlike people dogs are naturally good and loyal and kind chalie gets sent back to earth cause he winded up his life clock where he gets into even more mischief with his best friend itchy and a little orphan girl annemarie i used to watch this all the time as a kid and i still sometimes watch it anyways its a beautiful bittersweet film as i said before that might just leave a tear in your eye
6,adrian has just gone out of the asylum being rich and with no parents his life seems empty one day he meets gonzalo a poor boy whom mother is prostitute desperate for earning some money gonzalo helps adrian to search about his life and who where his parents this is a movie from a new director and it is perfectly clear in most of the film scenes not correctly directed dialogues a little forced some incoherences in the scriptanyway the ending is unexpectedly well done well just a little and that saves a little the film actors are known and with great quality nevertheless they are not inspired enough to make the movie interesting all of them have done better papers in other film the film results boring and probably you will spend most of the time thinking how much time will pass until it ends of course there are lots of worse films but sure there are many many better ones
7,witty and disgusting brash and intelligent baseketball redefines comedysports with a pot spoof of an easy target makes other so called comedies like dead boring one of the best of all time trey parker and matt stone play their roles as losers with apt perfection
2,i dont believe there has ever been a more evil or wicked television program to air in the united states as the 700 club they are todays equivalent to the ku klux klan of the 20th century their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of americans as well as billions of humans the world over who dont happen to share their bigoted cruel monstrous and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen the lies they spout and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth such as the idea of life after death or god or sin or the devil is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill so lost are they in their fantasy sane people know that religion is a drug and shouldnt let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy however the 700 club is in a class by itself they are truly a cult while i believe in freedom of speech they way they spread hatred lies disinformation and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits i hope that one day the american psychiatric association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion the 700 club though is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of cult but due to the 700 clubs vast wealth conned daily from the millions of americans locked in their deceitful grip they are above the law in this country for those of you who have seen the movie the matrix you know that movie was a metaphor for religion on earth the evil ones who are at the top of each of the religions who drain the ones they have trapped and cruelly abuse for their own selfish purposes and those millions who are held in a death sleep and slowly being drained of their life force represent those many people who belong to religions and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around thembr br in less civil times the good townsfolk would have run such monsters as those associated with the 700 club out of town with torches and pitchforks but in todays world where people have lost all choice in their choices of television that is presented to them we have no way to rid ourselves of the 700 club plague br br the television ratings system and the v chip on tvs should also have a rating called r for religion so that rational people and concerned parents could easily screen such vile intellectual and brutal emotional rape such as presented by the 700 club every day all over our country from themselves and their children
0,i really enjoyed this movie as a young kid at that age i thought that the silly baseball antics were funny and that the movie was cool because of its about sports now several years later i can look back and see what a well designed movie this was this movie opened my eyes as a small child to the struggles other children dealt with and real world issues that kind of exposure is largely lacking in kids movies these days which i dont think is to our societys benefit sure the baseball antics seem really dumb now but they drew kids in no seven year old is going to ask to see a movie about foster children but they will ask to see a movie about baseball disney realized this fact and took advantage of it to teach these children an important lesson about the worldbr br as a young adult the performance of al and the other angels seems far less impressive however i will give credit to the actors playing both children and danny glover who all did a fantastic job
3,this is the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen quite a few movies it is passed off as an art film but it is really a piece of trash its one redeeming quality is the beautiful tango dancing but that cannot make up for sally potters disgustingly obvious tribute to herself the plot of this movie is nonexistent and i guarantee you will start laughing by the end especially where she starts singing its absolutely unreal
6,very interesting and moving documentary about the world trade center tragedy on 11th september 2001the main theme of it is the heroism of american firefighters who tried to rescue as many people as they couldthe film is deeply emotional and rather disturbingmany people seen on screen have lost their livesrecommended
3,wow this movie bored the pants off me when i saw it bland pointless and unmovingbr br apparently ash and co can travel through time with the help of the spirit of the forest princess mononoke much there they meet a dorky kid named sam and the plot beginsbr br so tom ash and huck sam get high with nature become hippies and try to free celebi the spirit from some weirdo hunter guy i dont even know what else went on it all went by in a blur ashs friends were hardly in it and all the fight scenes were boringbr br after saving the day ash and his infamous friends must return to their time while watching sam float away with celebi that scene was just creepy oo then after returning to their time ash learns that his new friend is actually his rivals grandpa and i think thats it pretty retarded isnt it if you love your children you wont expose them to this out of 10
7,while listening to an audio book cambpell scott is the reader i was so excited to hear his voice and that brought back my disappointment that six degrees was canceled they never seem to keep the good shows on air long enough to capture an audience that can connect with the shows story what a shame and shame on th network for not giving this show a full seasons chance this was an excellent show to watch with a great cast the network gave men in trees a second chance witch is also a great show  but they took invasion off and that also was something totally different to watch not the same oldsame old themes why cant the networks get it right
2,series has got off to a great start i dont think you need to have watched series to get a grasp of whats happening but like any series its nice to feel some sense of the characters and to care about what happens to them and this show makes you think like that these 30something women seem to lead glamorous and exciting lives yet the premise is believable and realistic so the twists and turns that arrive thanks to their love and sex lives are exciting to watch but you also know that these are problems that happen to real women too its about the decisions we make as women and how sometimes we are led down certain paths in our lives rather than consciously making those choices
0,any one who has seen mel gibsons the passion of the christ and was bothered by the gory violence would want to see this film instead though it wasnt a success in th box office or tv ratings the fox movie channel still finds a real good motive to show this anually i liked the way that they trained chris sarandon and the men who portrayed his disciples to sing in hebrewthough sarandon didnt have long hair like any other jesus would in other films his looks are pretty close to what a jewish man would appear what surprised me or startled me was the scene where caiaphas told jesus about pilate and dont ever forget that you are a jew though that may have not been a racist remarkcolin blakely was trying to make chris sarandon look like garbage in the eyes of the prominent men of those dayskeith michells portrayal of pilate was hulking comparing with his previous performances in the story of jacob and joseph and the story of david but if you compare his portrayal of pilate with telly savalas or hurd hatfield you can say that he really painted well the impression of a roman procurator
6,this movie is directed by renny harlin the finnish miracle stallone is gabe walker cat and mouse on the mountains with ruthless terrorists renny harlin knows how to direct actionmovie stallone needed this role to get back on track snowy mountain is very good place for action movie and who is better to direct movie where is snow ice cold and bad weather than finnish man action is good music in the film is spectacular the bad guy is john litghow other stars micheal rooker  the portrait of serialkiller janine turner  strong medicine the is placed in beautiful place and it is very exciting movie overall good movie br br remember extreme lit special collectors edition with good extras comig soon in finland straight to video
2,i always thought this would be a long and boring talkingheads flick full of static interior takes dude i was wrong election is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thrillerdrama taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of triadsrituals characters are constantly on the move and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider its still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters furthermore johnnie to succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric lightshadow contrasts although theres hardly any action the ending is still shocking in its ruthless depicting of brutality cool movie that deserves more attention and i came to like the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit
7,i remember the days in which kim basinger was nothing more than a pretty face who adorned movies with typical characters of dumb blondieromantic interest or damsel in dangerbuteverything changed when she won an academy award as best supporting actress for her role in the excellent movie la confidentialand i think i was not the only one who was surprised by her solid performancehoweverafter that momenther career did not follow the ideal pathsurethe prestige she won thanks to that movie made her to participate on moderately prestigious movies like people i know or the door in the floorbut we have never seen her again on a substantial characterthe movie while she was out does nothing to put her on that situation and it is not only that her character is not too tastybut also that the movie is really crappythe screenplay from this movie could not be more hollow and basichoweverbasinger brings some conviction to her characterand that makes this poor movie to win a few pointsthis movie is full of clichs and generic villainsthe work of director susan montford is truly disastrous for many reasons but mainlybecause the movie never gets a good rhythm and tonethe ending from this movie is extremely ridiculousi do not recommend while she was out at allthis film commits the capital sin of being boring
1,sowe get so see added footage of brandointeresting but not exactly oscar worthy stuff susannah york was hardly a slouch new scene where lois finds out clark is superman is slightly unbelievable in that he doesnt notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget thatlets listen to donner make fun of lesters version that made more logical sense the president talks of the zod defacing the washington monument when it was originally mount rushmore tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd supermans freedom of the press line sounded silly compared to care to step outside which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to clarks earlier scene in the truck stop then there is the ending with the turn back the world to go back in time effect it turned back everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket aimed for hackensack nj ever went since it doesnt free zod and company any more
0,at first you think another disney movie it might be good but its a kids movie but when you watch it you cant help but enjoy it all ages will love this movie i first saw this movie when i was 10 and now years later i still love it danny glover is superb and could not play the part any better christopher lloyd is hilarious and is perfect for the part tony danza is so believable as mel clark you cant help but to enjoy this movie i give it a 1010
0,this is simply the funniest movie ive seen in a long time the bad acting bad script bad scenery bad costumes bad camera work and bad special effects are so stupid that you find yourself reeling with laughterbr br so its not gonna win an oscar but if youve got beer and friends round then you cant go wrong
4,i thought the whole movie played out beautifully with fresh images and interesting cinematography the whole way through it the actors were on top of their characters backs in nearly perfect timing and looked great the music was lush and wellthoughtout it even had a decent twist of an ending so whats with everyone voting it down the story wasnt entirely fresh felt like a remnant of running man with the whole television show idea but the attitude towards christianity and judaism about how the public picks their messiah certainly sounded true enough it made sense to follow this one man who was put before a modern crowd and to put him on a pedestal because of his opportunitybr br its possible that christians or other religious people pick this up because the movie has the word god in it but that shows what the filmmakers were trying to do is to teach a possibility to people who maybe never saw the world like this especially in the modern world where christianity has been more and more accepted and forgotten about by somebr br i gave it a 710 stars here on imdb i thought every ounce of the movie was entertaining and original for the mostpart check it out if youre not too offended to see an entertaining film from madrid spain about possibilities of the coming modern messiah to a tv near you
1,the marquis de sade egypt ancient gnostic cults robert englund in a dual role gratuitous sex and nudity murder and mayhem on paper tobe hoppers night terrors sounds like it should be at least a fun entertaining flick given the ingredients its not it is a plot less incoherent shambles that brings little entertainment there is basically no plot beyond some vague stuff about a cult that follows the work of de sade who for some unclear reason feel the need to seduce the daughter of a local christian archaeologist and kill her that is pretty much it i think it has something to with the gnostics but who knows what the writers were thinking most of the movie is a meandering mess as the heroine is exposed to various weirdness dream sequences and erotic encounters intercut with scenes of englund as the imprisoned de sade in the 19th century chewing the scenery it seems like the makers were trying for something serious but whatever their pretensions were they are buried in the cheesiness bad acting sleaze and fake looking decapitated headsbr br there arent too many good points robert englund is fun to watch as always and the lead actress zoe trilling whilst not very talented is attractive and in various stages of undress through the movie but watching night terrors is a chore at least i got to see the movie from which the when youre as criminal as i bit from the australian film certification ratings guide that was on the front of so many vhs tapes from the nineties came from
7,the problems with nikhil advanis salaameishq are many a oneline concept that looks good on paper which also worked in an earlier english film  love actually goes terribly wrong thanks to inept and shallow writing a wellintentioned idea gets crushed to smithereens under the weight of its own gargantuan ambition a director so completely besotted by his own much applauded first film goes overboard with the devices that worked in his earlier film kal ho na ho  try counting the number of times the device of split screens is used in this flick the problem is  what worked fabulously in kal ho na ho were the emotional excesses of the karan johar school of filmmaking but here emotion doesnt quite grace us with its appearance on the screen  no not even cursorily the writer director gives us six relationships with one common problem  love but where is the intensity where is the depth where is the emotion a tribute to love sans emotion and one that goes on and on and on nah it just cannot work br br in my opinion the basic requirement for a portmanteau film like this to work is that not only should each individual story be complete it should  in some way or the other  follow the graph of the traditional threeact structure screen writing guru syd fields paradigm thats the real reason why salaameishq didnt work for me none of the stories had any depth or a rollercoaster ride of emotional ups and downs one expects in mainstream hindi cinema also the linkage between some of the stories seemed tenuous and very forced its not clear what salman khan is doing at ayesha takias wedding if he was required to be present at the wedding scene for a neat wrapup why not conjure a few more coincidences and bring the other two couples also to the wedding that would be neaterbr br but yes some of the stories did have a lot of promise for one the anil kapoorjuhee chawla story tries to address a very real situation  midlife crisis but its journey is so linear that youre left wondering if it was really an issue similarly the problem of commitment in the akshaye khannaayesha takia story is also true to life if only it was developed a little better i felt that the more promising stories in this mishmash were told from the male point of view which is fine but it brings down the emotional quotient of these stories because the female characters  juhee chawla and ayesh takia in particular  have all the depth of a halffilled bath tub wasnt this film supposed to be about 12 different lives now the actors john abraham still needs to learn acting while vidya balan is dependable and endearing as ever anil kapoor gets a role written just for him but sometimes overplay the boredom of his character since she didnt get a meaty character to portray juhee chawla uses her charming smile and natural acting style to cover up for it akshaye khanna is fine despite going a trifle overthetop in a few scenes ayesha takia has nothing much to do but she does remind us that shes the same girl who surprised us with her bravura performance in dor govinda tries to make up for that huge mistake called bhagam bhag and succeeds to a large extentbr br that brings me the most irritating track of the film which unpardonably ends up hogging the maximum screen time  salman khan and priyanka chopra the track is irritating mainly because of them but i must credit them for their consistency theyre consistently bad all through the film priyanka could well be the next queen of hamming  i dont buy the crap that her role that of an item girl required her to act overthetop somebody should tell her the difference between being flamboyant because the character demands it and downright hamming if youve seen rakhi sawant who seems to be the inspiration behind this role in her interviews and bigg boss youll know what i mean i strongly feel that if nikhil advani had taken rakhi sawant in this role rather than a bigger star like priyanka the story would have worked better salman khans phony accent iswell shannon esras hindi is less accented than salmansbr br to be fair to the director he does manage to add some good directorial touches to the film i particularly liked the use of grey as the predominant color in the anil kapoorjuhee chawla story as a metaphor for their boring existence and the bright colors that come into the story with the arrival of the other woman but will anyone choose to paint their house in varying depressing shades of grey thats acceptable cinematic license i would say but when the film runs almost for hours it almost feels like the director is trying too hard to give the audience a glimpse of his touch in an endlessly meandering montage of uninspiring sequencesbr br maybe nikhil advani wants us to sit in the theatre for as long as is humanly possible pata nahin kal ho na ho
1,andy goldsworthy is a taoist master of the first order expressing the way through his sublime ephemeral art indeed time and change is what his work is fundamentally about i bought his first book several years ago and my family has marveled at it many times so it was a treat to get to know the artist personally through this film he is just as patient and gentle as you would expect and has some wonderful things to say about the natural world the deepest of which are expressed in his occasional inability to say it in words at all he is like most children who play in the great outdoors alone if they do anymore creating things from sticks and sand and mud and snow before they outgrow it mr goldsworthy was given the gift and the mission to extend that sort of play to create profound visions of nature and to open our often weary eyes to it in brilliant new ways and always with the utmost respect gratitude and humor of a wandering and wondering monk
7,can anybody do good cgi films besides pixar i mean really animation looked antiquated by 2006 standards and even by 1995 toy story standards or maybe they spent all their budget on hugh jackman whatever their reasoning the story truly did suckbr br somehow hugh jackman is a rat  a rat that is flushed down a toilet yeah i know seems stereotypical but then the sewer mimicked the ways of london  to an extent throw in a promise of jewels  and an evil frog and you get a pathetic attempt at entertainmentbr br i would like to say something entertained me maybe the hookup in the movie or maybe the happilyeverafter rat relationship but nothing did it had the talent but it blew up d
5,i really have to disagree with guyyardleyrees who should he have watched the entire film would have seen some absolutely stunning scottish scenery some of the best ever shot in skye and found a film with a difficult start come together into a really poignant wholebr br this is not a big budget film rather it is a film that has a strong community feelbr br i cant say how much standard films bore me  pushing out the same polished stuff again and again seachd doesnt seem to be about that at all it really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more gaelic than any recent scottish filmbr br ok so the acting isnt in the style a blockbuster thats because the actors are seemingly real people i actually thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing  and at times unusually beautifulbr br seachd really bears a second viewing since there are many threads that become clearer second time around  that really do feed into the endingbr br overall the combination of music and at times stunning visuals plus a community approach to the acting and nonnormal structure has turned seachd into quite a distinctive and memorable film more of these please
7,sondra locke stinks in this film but then she was an awful actress anyway unfortunately she drags everyone else including then real life boyfriend clint eastwood down the drain with her but what was clint eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one one read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer its an exceptionally weak story basically no story or plot at all add in bored poor acting even from the normally good eastwood theres absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as i was concerned this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers wow could a film be any more boring i think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun a real stinker dont bother with this one
6,oh my god what the hell happened here im not going to say this again but what sort of backward movie is this the dubbing in this is way worst than the dubbing in king kong vs godzillalinda miller had to be the worst actress in it and the suits are really cheesyits about some villain called drwho who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as king kong but when this robot breaks down he builds another one and then tries to kidnap kongwhen he doesthats when linda miller gets annoyinghe makes kong his slave but everything goes wrong and king kong escapesthen drwho sends the robot after himbr br later when i was watching the movie i got a headache when linda miller and the other clowns started moaningas i sat through the misery of watching the dvd while it was playing i was hoping that the madness in the movie was going to end until the fightthe ending has to be a really bad one because they couldve shown kong back on his island fighting dinosaurs againbr br dont watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do beware of the disappointment you will receive
7,a very early oliver stone associateproduced film and one of the first films in the impressive career of lloyd kaufman cofounder and president of the worlds only real independent film studio troma creator of the toxic avenger and at the prestigious amsterdam fantastic filmfestival lifetimeachievement awarded filmmaker for over 30 years having raised the money for this film on his own lloyd wrote this script together with theodore gershuni in 1970 and in hindsight regrets having listened to advice to have gershuni else direct the film instead of doing it himself but back then he was still inexperienced in the business and it is probably because of decisions like these that he takes no nonsense from anyone anymore indeed it would have been interesting to see lloyds version of his own script  as one of the worlds most original daring experimental and noncompromising directors he probably would have given it even more edge than it already has but as it is we have the gershunidirected film and weather it is due to the strong script or the fact that he too is indeed quite a director of his own sugar cookies is a very intelligent highly suspenseful and wellcrafted motion picture that deserves a lot more attention than it receives the shoestring budget the small studio this was even before kaufman and his friend and partner for over 30 years now michael herz formed troma had to work with is so well handled that the film looks a lot more expensive indeed does not have a low budget look at all the story revolves around lesbian camilla stone played by enigmatic mary woronow and her lover who winds up dead through circumstances i wont reveal not to spoil a delightful story this leads to a succession of plottwists mind games and personality reform that is loosely inspired by hitchcocks vertigo and at least as inventive the atmosphere is a lot grimmer though and some comparisons to nicholas roegs and donald cammells performance come to mind in this mix is a very original and inventive erotic laden thriller that keeps it quite unclear as to how it is all going to end which along with a splendidly interwoven subplot with a nod to kaufmans earlier and unfortunately unavailable big guss whats the fuss makes for a very exciting oneandahalfhour certainly one of the best films in tromas library and yet again one of those films that defy the curious fantasy that their catalog is one of bad taste the dvd includes some recent interviews kaufman conducts with woronov and the other leading lady lynn lowry later seen in george romeros the crazies thus giving some interesting insight in what went on during the making of this cultfavorite and a few hints of what would be different had lloyd directed it himself highly recommended
5,i think ive seen worse films so im giving this a but its a struggle to remember what they could have been possibly xtro nasty  dull or possibly creep just plain dull but it is a struggle to think of something worse its difficult to know where to start lets just say its a poor mans under siege starring an even poorer mans jean claude van damme the only redeeming feature was seeing casper van dien  i always wondered what happened to him after starship troopers yes he was johnny rico if you really want to knowbr br judging from this site hes been stuck in tv movie hell casper be more selective please arghhhhh ive just turned over and theres a half decent film on called criminal law now im beginning to get really resentful about the last 15hrs
1,dont listen to fuddyduddy critics on this one this is a gem young rich joan and her brother find themselves penniless after their father dies  and now they have to work for a living she naturally becomes a reporter and he just as naturally a driver for the mob by wild coincidences their careers meet head on thanks to gangster clark gable in the meantime there is the chance for a moonlight underwear swim for a bunch of pretty young things and for joan to do a couple of risque dance numbers with all the grace of a steamshovelbr br but none of this is supposed to be taken seriously  its all good fun from those wonderful precode days when hollywood was really naughty joan looks great and displays much of the emotional range that would give her career such longevity thank god she stopped the dancing gable is remarkable as a slimy gangster  he wasnt a star yet and so didnt have to be the hero great to see him playing something different and william bakewell is excellent as the poor confused brother and there are some great montages and tracking shots courtesy of director harry beaumont who moves the piece on with a cracking pace  and an occasional wink to the audience great fun
2,this movie was a great disappointment for me i had been waiting for this movie to come out for years and i was a faithful follower of chaos comics until they went bankrupt not only did they cut out half the story line but they altered information the statement that lucifer is hopes father is untrue he did corrupt her father but he himself is not her father the voices also did not suit the characters and once you hear the voice of a beloved character the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned i can not even remember everything about this film that was wrong the bottom line is if you love lady death do not watch this movie it just did not do the comic justice at all
4,feeding the masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombie movies to be after your hardearned dollars suggestion keep your hardearned dollars and lets just say that good old theatrex took one for the team on this one guess what the plots about zombies taking over this time though for the sake of originality  this film takes place in rhode island and to be honest im not sure ive ever seen a zombie flick based in rhode island a tv station controlled by the government is supposedly keeping up normal broadcasts so that any remaining citizens wont think that theres any problem in the world that is those that never look or go outside anyway i will say though that a few of the commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most amusing part of this film there is actually somewhat of a story to this but im not bothering with that because after a while youll either not care or have fallen asleep at any rate this has plenty of terrible acting to throw on top off all the seen it all before stuff that gets trotted out before the camera trust me you can find plenty of other things to do with your time than watch this out of 10
1,scoop is easily woody allens funniest film of the 2000s so far allen although finally looking his age is at the top of his game as lowbrow magician sidney waterman his oneliners and demeanor are hilarious dont let the critics sway your opinion scoop is a top notch woodylite picture br br the classical music score is an excellent compliment to the action on screen scarlett johanson looks gorgeous in that bathing suit jackman is dashing the cinematography glows scoop is wonderful escapist fare from start to finish the last shot of the film alone is worth the admission price
0,im a big fan of troma but i cant figure out why they bought the rights to this movie its so boring i felt like i was watching for hours some where on the plot summary it says but what satan doesnt know hes stuck with annoying tourists well they didnt seem to bother him in the movie just mebr br the only good thing about this movie is the actor who plays satan i like bad movies but it was just boring
0,i was an usherette in an old theater in northern california when this movie came out as good as it is on dvd its even more eerie and terrifying on the big screen although it has been about years since i have seen it it is still one of my alltime favorites at the risk of sounding trite they just dont make em like this anymore if sixth sense freaked you out at all this movie is definitely for you great storyline incredible cast of characters ominous setting even the soundtrack has a haunting quality to it i highly recommend you not watch it alone what a brownstone apartment was renting for in 1977 alone will have you gasping it would be at least 10times that price today
2,this movie is outrageous by outrageous i mean awful i had more fun watching the paint dry at my local hardware store on an august day while suffering from a migraine and heat stroke the acting got progressively worse as the movie advanced and the directors use of euphoric drugs became apparent as the final scenes approached when misty was shot to death she decided that it would be prudent to blink post mordem that was not intelligent truthfully stevie wonder could have caught that with his eyes closed if you are deciding between playing with a nail gun while intoxicated and watching this movie bear in mind that the nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends
4,i should explain why i gave thispiece of art star rating out of possible 10 simply because its hard or next to impossible to rate it unbiased probably it would have been the same if i had given it 1010  explanations anyway would have followedbr br i am not fond of these pointless gore movies like hostel or so  i think thats disgusting and pretty terrible in all the possible contextual meanings but as i found out after watching this movie  there is a genre called historical drama  and probably it would have been the case of 1010 as it has plenty of it and tarantino would have been more than happier with it and made kill bill to spill even more blood on screen than here to show that it is possible but the thing about historical drama genre is that its a subcategory of the trash movies where john romero is the undeadgoryemperoroftheguts and so automatically it cant be rated as your default movie  as these are movies that are made bad on purpose and you cant really tell whether the comically bad moment was meant to be so or it was simply bad its for the people who like to enjoy bad acting bad screenplay and bad everything else and by some turn of faith  i am one of them too there are days when i have an urge of seeing a really bad movie and look up for some trash and here you go  the day is saved but thats definitely an opinion of mine and doesnt have match with anyones elsebr br what i wanted to say is that if you want to watch some terrible movie  then fellinis casanova is definitely the choice but heed my advice and dont rate it by default means
7,richard brooks excellent 1967 film of truman capotes novel in cold blood is a perfect companion piece to philip seymour hoffmans oscar winning performance in the 2005 capote they really play well together try them on separate nights it is unusual to find films made 38 years apart that mesh so well these two truly enhance each other even though different actors play the roles of killers perry smith and dick hickock the two pieces blend well only the part of the writer played by paul stewart in the brooks films is weaker as they give him a different name then capote id suggest watching capote first followed by in cold blood it makes for a powerful experience
2,this is a quirky little movie and i have to agree that there is some quirky acting in it as wellbr br it follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous las vegas illusionist and is partly about following his dream partly about the dreams of others and all about the travails of showbiz i thought the movie was charming and it has a moment or two of real magic that make the whole thing worthwhilebr br alan arkin is terrific as the magician who never was and his mentoring of max makes for a funny and touching relationshipbr br not for everyone probably but if you like movies about the journey then i think youll like this one
3,beside the fact that in all its awesomeness this movie has risen beyond all my expectations this masterpiece of cinema history portrait the overuse of crappy filters in its best paul johansson and craig sheffer show a brotherconflict with all there is to it as usual a woman concieling her true intentions the end came as surprising as unforssen as the killing of keith scott by his older brotherbr br the scenes in wiking land are just as i remember it from my early time travels  to be honest my strong passion for trash movies makes this one a must have in my never finished collectionbr br i recommend this movie to all the people in love with the most awesome brother cast from one tree hillbr br odin
3,i had been subjected to this movie for a relationship class in my school as figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through it had an interesting side to it but it just doesnt live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original we have the main character who has the older sister who like in every other movie like this has a thing against him we have the stay at home mother who expects too much and when he gives more she feels offended and leaves him in the dust then we have the father who is always gone then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does on to the story like i said it was interesting but the lack of good acting from the entire cast and the lack of any good writing or storytelling everything about this fell into clich the little nerd kid in school starts studying with girl they get together have sex and then boom we have a little kid perhaps it couldve been better had the writing been well better and had the acting been improved ive seriously gotten more emotion out of leatherface and his chainsaw than i did out of any actor in this film and thats pretty bad seeing as the leatherface movies are crap and horridly acted so far the only interesting teen pregnancy movie ive seen was juno so far the comical side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while still giving the same message like i said the idea was original most of these films focus on the teen mother but this one chose not to instead it focuses on the drama of the father but again the originality does not save this movie from mediocrity i really hope someone decides to either remake this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another similar film because this one was wasted potential
5,think a darker version of one of those kid shows such as power rangers and you have this film from 1990 robot jox a movie where you fight with giant robots two men enter the arena and whoever comes out their country wins the robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are less colorful so while this movie is not good it isnt all bad to watch there are as i recall two robot fights in this one one that ends badly and the final showdown there is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed but in the end the plot is nothing that is going to stick with you for any amount of time after the picture is done the fights themselves look like giant toys on the rampage but still somewhat fun to watch this movie would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and the tournament so it is worth checking out once but probably not more than that
7,this was the worst acted movie ive ever seen in my life no really im not kidding all the based on a true storyhistorical references aside theres no excuse for such bad acting its a shame because as others have posted the sets  costumes were greatbr br the sound track was typical asianstyle music although i couldnt figure out where the modern love song came in when fernando was lying in his bed thinking of maria i dont know who wrote  sang that beautiful song but it was as if suddenly norah jones was transported to the 1500sbr br the hershey syrup blood in phycho was more realistic than the ketchup spurted during the kwiknez battle scenesbr br but the acting oh so painfully sad lines delivered like a bad junior high play if gary stretch had donned a potato costume for the county 4h fair he may have been more believable towards the end he sounded more like a little italy street thug at times i half expected him to yell out adrian or even you wanna piece of mebr br favourite line when the queen says to her lover after barfing on the floor im going to have a baby he responds a child i expected her to retort no jackass a chair leg duh
5,i was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent indian candians but i found this show to be not funny at all the producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned its getting talked about i was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason they are usually true but there really wasnt anything funny about these stereotypical characters the fresh of the boat dad who doesnt understand his daughter the radical feminist muslim daughter who by the way is a terrible actress and the young modern indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can hes a pretty good actor i only see him getting betterbr br it is very contrived and the dialog doesnt flow that well there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed and dont really care to watch another episodebr br i did however enjoy watching a great canadian actress sheila mccarthy again shes always a treat and a natural at everything she does too bad her daughter in the show doesnt have the same acting abilities
5,i purchased this video quite cheaply exrental thinking that the cover looked quite nice and it was nice but the movie is trash i can handle bgrade i sometimes even enjoy a good b romp ie surf nazis must die is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be but this was just bland bland bland incredibly dull scenes were broken up too sparsely by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences this movie has very little to offer
6,when you actually find a video game to be scary or disturbing you know that the developers have done some very serious and hard work to make the whole thing work undying used the unreal engine but had very little resemblance to that game when it came to actual gameplay speaking of gameplay the pace is slowed down and the sheer difficulty in progressing through the very hard to kill enemies makes for a very unqiue gameplay experience the production values are so high that you may even forget that it is a video game the game itself is also packed with loads of secrets that you have to uncover using special vision the level design in fantastic and the weapons as well as the enemies will really shock you
0,this movie is a terrible waste of time although it is only an hour and a half long it feels somewhere close to i have never seen a movie move so slowly and so without a purpose this is also a horror film that takes place a lot of the time during daylight my friend and i laughed an insane amount of times when we were probably supposed to be scaredbr br the only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was released in so many countries it cannot be that high in demand br br the supermodel nicole petty should stick to modeling because although she is beautiful she lost her accent so many times in this movie half of the time she is british and half the time she is american
6,although recognized as the best film treatment of the difficulties of having a house in the country built or bought to your specifications it is not the first nor the last in 1940 jack benny and ann sheridan were the leads in the film version of the comedy george washington slept here by george s kaufman and moss hart and about fifteen years ago shelly long and tom hanks had the lead in the money pit the former was about moving into an 18th century country house thaterr needs work the latter was about building your dream house  in the late 1980s although the two films have their moments both are not as good as blandings which was based on an autobiographical novel of the same namebr br jim blandings and his wife muriel cary grant and myrna loy are noticing the tight corners of their apartment which they share with their two daughters joan and betsy sharyn moffett and connie marshall although blandings has a good income as an advertising executive in 1948 he is making 1500000 a year which was like making 9000000 today and lives in a luxury apartment  which in the new york city of that day he rents  he feels they should seek something better he and muriel take a drive into the country connecticut and soon find an old ruin that both imagine can be fixed up as that dream house they wantbr br and they both fall into the financial worm hole that buying land and construction can lead to for one thing they are so gung ho about the idea of building a home like this they fail to heed warning after warning by their wise if cynical friend and lawyer bill cole melvin douglas in a nicely sardonic role for example jim buys land from a connecticut dealer ian wolfe sucking his chops quietly with a check before double checking the correct cost for the land in that part of connecticut bill points out hes paid about five or six thousand dollars more for the land than it is worth there are problems about water supply that both blandings just never think about such as hard and soft water  which leads to the zis  zis water softening machine they find that the designs they have in mind and have worked out with their architect reginald denny cant be dropped cheaply at a spur of the moment decision by muriel to build a little rookery that nobody planned for br br the escalating costs of the project are one matter that bedevils jim he has been appointed to handle the wham account spam had become a popular result of world war ii in that the public started using it as a meat substitute in the light of its success with the armed forces jim cant get a grip on this hes not alone  one or two other executives fumbled it before him he comes up with the following bit of poetrybr br this little piggy went to marketbr br he was pink and as pretty as hambr br he smiled in his tracksbr br as they gave him the ax br br he knew he would end up as whambr br his secretary looks at him as though he needs a straight jacket when he reads that onebr br jim also is increasingly suspicious of the attentions of bill to muriel although in this case bill is blameless but hes always around jim keeps forgetting that bill is the clearheaded one and that hes keeping jim and muriel from making so many mistakes all three have mishaps the best being when they get locked in a room in the half constructed house just as the men have left for the day they cant open the door and jim in a panic tries breaking the door down by a makeshift battering ram he breaks a window and the door opens by itselfbr br the film works quite satisfactorily with all of the actors apparently enjoying themselves it is one film which despite changing price levels and salary levels really does not age at all after all most americans dream of owning their own home and always havebr br a number of years ago a paint company made use of a delightful scene with myrna loy and emory parnell regarding the paint job parnells company has to do on the various rooms she carefully shows the distinct shades of red blue etc she wants  even giving a polite parnell a single thread for the right shade of blue the commercials hinted that the paint company had a wide variety of colors to choose from for your paint job they proudly called loy mrs blandings in the commercials introduction you can imagine though how the nononsense parnell handles the situation afterward when loy leaves him with his paint crew
2,did sandra yes she must have know we would still be here for her some nine years laterbr br see it if you havent again if you have see her live while you can
0,the woman in black 1989 is a tv adaptation of susan hills modern classic ghost story published only a few years earlier than the film was made sadly this film has not been released on dvd and as far as i am aware it has been deleted on vhs its availability is in direct contrast to its popularity amongst those in the know about horror films the story revolves around events in a seaside community in the early 20th century where a young solicitor is sent by his firm to conclude the affairs of a recently deceased widow who died on her isolated marshland estate what he thought would be a routine and probably tedious task turns into a nightmare as he discovers that the old woman was haunted to her death and that the ghosts of her past are not content to rest the story is told in a subtle but concise way never being selfindulgent flashy or overexpositional the obviously tight budget may have contributed to the nononsense approach but its just what the story needs and why it works so well its what you dont see that scares having said that there is one particularly terrifying scene that relies on the visual and it works to perfection i watched this film during the day and it still gave me nightmares nearly a week later if you love being terrified do what you must to get hold of and watch a copy of the woman in black
7,theres a great deal of material from the modesty blaise comics and novels that would be great in a movie unfortunately several attempts have been made and theyve fallen short of the great potential in the character so no this isnt the modesty you know from the comic strip currently reprinted in nice editions from titan books this is modesty some or years prior to the first strip and from what you can piece together from her backstory its accuratebr br miramax had the movie rights to the character with quentin tarantino acting as advocate and technical adviser early drafts of the miramax project attempted to adapt one of the best novels but always managed to leave out some crucial element tarantino wasnt happy with any of them and offered to remove his name from the project so they could proceed to the studios credit they wanted to keep him in the process since they knew he got the character and her world with the movie rights close to expiration they decided to try a very different approach the result was my name is modesty a small directtovideo movie that introduces the characterbr br the movie does not introduce willie garvin or sir gerald these characters are important to blaises adventures throughout most of the published stories what this movie accomplishes is showing the strength of the character by herself she never loses her composure and you never doubt that shes in charge even unarmed in a room full of gangsters with guns most of the movie takes place within a casino which undoubtedly saved money on the production it doesnt matter the film does not come across as cheap instead it gives a fairly comprehensive and believable backstory for the character and demonstrates just how far she thinks ahead should miramax adapt any of the comic stories or novels now theyve laid out the characters background nicely and wont have to spend much time on her origin i realize the words directtovideo dont inspire confidence but this film is well worth a look
2,this movie is pretty cheesy but i do give it credit for at least trying to provide some characterization for its principles there are some great moments in the film and the dialogue has some great moments as wellbr br the aerial assault sequence is perhaps the best part of the moviebr br i guess i really like the idea of what lengths a veteran will go for a fellow veteran sure its not all that well done but the premise is not at all badbr br tom
2,i managed to catch a late night double feature last night of before sunrise 1995 and before sunset 2004 and saw both films in a row without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately after sleeping it over i have to say that i largely prefer the former over the latter and i shall explain whybr br before sunrise introduces us with then young actors ethan hawke reality bites dead poets society only 25 at the time of the films release and julie delpy the three colors trilogy then 26 although looking much younger he is a promiscuous american writer touring europe after breaking up with his girlfriend she is a young french student on her way home to paris they meet on the budapestvienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together the two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of vienna exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on lovebr br the film has 1990s written all over it back then technology was leaping rapidly the new millennium with all its hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future the characters of jesse hawke and celine delpy with all their flaws and inconsistencies celines accent if by mistake or on purpose was half americanhalf french and it swinged from one spectrum to the other breaking the characters credibility were a mirror of the time watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement acting all clichd and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well is what really made this movie work for me the fact that the director doesnt let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth whilebr br all in all sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of vienna a well told classical romantic rendezvous and a film i will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future
4,i always wrote this series off as being a complete stinkfest because jim belushi was involved in it and heavily but then one day a tragic happenstance occurred after a white sox game ended i realized that the remote was all the way on the other side of the room somehow now i could have just gotten up and walked across the room to get the remote or even to the tv to turn the channel but then why not just get up and walk across the country to watch tv in another state nuts to that i said so i decided to just hang tight on the couch and take whatever fate had in store for me what fate had in store was an episode of this show an episode about which i remember very little except that i had once again made a very broad general sweeping blanket judgment based on zero objective or experiential evidence with nothing whatsoever to back my opinions up with and once again i was completely right this show is a total crudpie belushi has all the comedic delivery of a hairy lighthouse foghorn the women are physically attractive but too stepfordis to elicit any real feeling from the viewer there is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running down to the local tv station with a can of gasoline and a flamethrower and sending every copy of this mutt howling back to hell br br except br br except for the wonderful comic sty lings of larry joe campbell americas greatest comic character actor this guy plays belushis brotherinlaw andy and he is gold how good is he really well aside from being funny his job is to make belushi look good thats like trying to make butt warts look good but campbell pulls it off with style someone should invent a nobel prize in comic buffoonery so he can win it every year without larry joe this show would consist of a slightly vacant looking courtney thornesmith smacking belushi over the head with a frying pan while he alternately beats his chest and plays with the straw on the floor of his cage stars for larry joe campbell designated comedic bacon because he improves the flavor of everything hes in
6,this film is roughly what it sounds like a futuristic version of the cinderella legend but with songs and fairly tame sex scenes the film is not sure what it wants to be and pretty much ends up a mess its more expensive looking than most of director al adamsons films but its not at the same budget level that viewers have come to expect from scifi films the actors are pretty bad and unlike most adamson films there are no former big namers or b actors some of the music is ok but its easy to see why cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for so many years
0,a sophisticated contemporary fable about the stresses that work to loosen and ultimately unbind the vows of marriage the main thrust of the narrative arises from a homily spoken by a country priest following the wedding vows of a young cosmopolitan couple from milan in it the future course of the marriage is spelled out which bit by bit frays from the stresses of modern life the moral of this story within a story is that in order for a marriage to work out both now and in the past it has been necessary for that relationship to be abutted by family and friends this film was a relative blockbuster by domestic italian standards its a terrible shame that this film is not available in either dvd or vhs
0,after citizen kane in 1941 hollywood executives turned their cobwebbed backs on the great orson welles with the exception of kane welles lost all creative control on magnificent ambersons journey into fear and many other films to come welles was an innovative and creative genius the most unconventional of filmmakers when hollywood was in need of a few more the lady from shanghai is yet another example of the misunderstood view of welles films at the time a movie that seems a bit choppy and nonfluent it has a conventional 1940s premise told in a most unconventional way and i am sure some scenes ended up on the cutting room floor it is now legend that columbia mogul harry cohn stood up during its initial screening and asked what it was about in hindsight many old grumps that ran the studios back then had not one clue as to the cinematic techniques and master storytelling of orson welles and the lady from shanghai is only nearly great because of their intrusionbr br beside being arguably the greatest director of alltime welles was also quite a performer as an actor at 25 we all know what he did as charles foster kane perhaps the most famous character in film history here he inhabits a rare character of dim wit and not much intelligence something unfamiliar to those familiar with welles other great work instead of a slick wise tongue he speaks with a rough irish twang rita hayworth his unhappily married wife at the time plays an unhappily married wife of a lawyer who puts welles in a spell and is able to draw him into a job that will take him to the limits of deception and disillusionment he is a large lug who may have even murdered a man but the real mystery lies in the relationship between hayworth with stunning blonde hair and crippled hubby everett sloane mr bernstein from citizen kane a creepy partner of sloanes is along for the sail around the country to set off a number of peculiar events that has welles michael ohara head spinning welles narrates the picture as ohara but things are still unclear throughout see for yourself and realize that it takes at least viewings to fully know exactly whats upbr br an uncharacteristically strange courtroom sequence centers around ohara with sloane defending him it is an oddly comedic scene with some quirky courtroom methods including sloane crossexamining himself i didnt really laugh here because the film stalls at this point after a first portion that never gets to take off anyway up to this point the cinematography is great some scenes are shot with craft and skill aquarium love scene but there is no distinct line drawing the elements and us the audience in reportedly the court scene was reshot against welles requests 10 closeups of hayworth were ordered and a makeshift song sung by the starlet was thrown in at cohns insistence a gaudy score infuriated welles who once again was left out of the editing process thank welles himself for saving the film entirely with a tourdeforce ending that will always be treasured the socalled hall of mirrors scene brings buffs back time and time again rightfully sobr br it must be seen to be believed and it does a good job of wrapping up some confusing ideas presented the crash of the mirrors represents oharas disillusionment and the crazy house itself is a masterpiece of art and set decoration it seems more like a state of mind than an actual place and is indeed crazy twisted and turned like a dali painting this is a great ending to a flawed picture that if left alone would probably have made the afis top 100 then again or more of orson welles films may have made all collective best of lists if he had been left alone to create his own magicbr br note look for the mercury players that are so prominent in welles pictures they pop up all over rating of 10
7,ive read most of the comments on this movie i have seen this movieand the whole prophecy series many times with family members of all ages we all enjoyed and it just made us meditate on what we already knew from reading and studying the bible about the rapture and end times no one got scared or traumatized like i have read on some posts the movie is just based on biblical facts i have seen a lot of end time movies tribulation armagedon and so on and by far this one is one of the best in presenting bible truths it may not have a lot of great special effects like todays movies but i believe it is a good witnessing tool this movie and its prophecy series can be seen free at this website higherpraisecom and judge for yourself blessings to all
1,pendragon pictures new film h g wells war of the worlds the first faithful adaptation of the original novel has been in development for about years a theatrical release was intended for earlier this year march 2005 but this never happened the dvd was rushed out to coincide with the release of spielbergs version which hits theatres june 29br br i liked this film with certain reservationsbr br how faithful is the adaptation its not quite 100 faithful to wells book but 90  95 faithful is good enough for me at least several scenes were totally new such as ogilvy the astronomers confrontation with a farmer and the unnamed writernarrator awkwardly having tea with his cousin but on the whole this film follows the book very closely  certainly much more than the classic 1953 version by george palbr br its greatest fault is that it was obviously made on a very cheap budget the majority of it seems to have been shot bluescreen and composited with digitally rendered backgrounds this is particularly annoying during most of the interior shots and scenes of crowded city streets the overviews of 1898 london look like something from a video game numerous scenes in horsecarriages were faked  i guess they couldnt afford to rent a horse the only scenes shot for real seem to be those in open fields or forestsbr br but within those budget restrictions they managed to do quite a lot artistically the film looks right the martians and their tripods are quite well done and very true to wells descriptions i was particularly impressed with the heat ray although the thunder child sequence which should have been one of the films highlights is very disappointing its a great shame that they couldnt afford more actual sets or better quality animationbr br the acting and direction wont win any oscars for the most part they are competent not bad but not outstanding the music is quite good also though not on a par with any of the major hollywood composersbr br im actually glad this didnt get a theatrical release because the budget limitation would have made it look much worse on a big screen as it stands i would rate this similarly to a bbctv adaptation of classic literaturebr br a few nitpicks most of the scenes are presented with various colored filters mostly red this may have been an artistic choice but it is used very inconsistently and seems more like a sloppy job of mastering the dvd and the writernarrators obviously fake moustache mutates from scene to scenebr br bottom line  is it worth seeing if you can look past the technical and budgetary limitations and get into the story i think you will enjoy this especially if youve actually read the original h g wells novel if however you are easily put off by cheap production values youd best pass on this unless youre a mst3k fan be warned however that the film runs a full hours so i dont recommend watching it all in one sittingbr br btw an entirely different version of war of the worlds aka invasion came out on dvd the same month that spielbergs hit the theatres httpimdbcomtitlett0449040 this was also made on a budget but is updated to the present day like the spielberg film  but its much better and to top it off jeff wayne is making an animated film of his bestselling album from 1978 but that wont be out until 2007
7,following the success of the awful gilligans island tv movie reruns a number of tv movies were made in the 1980s reuniting casts from classic shows most of these movies completely missed the boat as far as recapturing the humor that made the shows so special the munsters revenge is among the most disappointing because it goes for a laurel and hardytype comedy style that really wasnt in the original series yvonne de carlo a wonderful comedienne and essential to the series is completely wasted  she has less time here in this 90 minute movie than she did in any single 30 minute episode and since the roles of eddie and marilyn in this movie are nothing more than cameos what was the point of making them younger and recasting them with very little rewriting they could have used butch patrick and pat priest although seeing some of the munsters spooky relatives was a nice touch i didnt enjoy sid caesar as the hammy mad scientist mainly because theres too much of him and not enough of the underused munsters ironically that very year 1981 caesars old partner in comedy imogene coca was also inappropriately cast in a major part in a tv movie reunion return of the beverly hillbillies another strange inexplicable bit at the beginning of the film has the munster family represented as wax figures at a local horror wax museum why would they be in there when they are supposed to be a typical if strange american family not famous monsters this was the last munsters project featuring the original cast in their roles there was an awful revival of the series in the late 1980s with a completely new cast and a 1990s tv movie which featured decarlo lewis priest and patrick in cameo roles as a family dining
1,before sunrise is a wonderful love story and has to be among my top favorite movies ever dialog and acting are great i love the characters and their ideas and thoughts of course the romantic vienna introduced in the movie does not exist you wont find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night and it isnt possible to get to all the places in only one night either especially if youre a stranger and its your first night in vienna but thats not the point the relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic although nothing ever really happens the movie never gets boring the ending is genuinely sad without being titanic or something even if you dont like love stories you should watch this film im a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released in summer the first part is perfect as it is in my opinion
0,if youre the kind of moviegoer who enjoys original content and intelligent suspensethen look elsewhere kids cause sleepwalkers really sucks usually im more eloquent than that butwowthis was bad i especially love it when charles offers tanya a ride home she declines and then he is seen walking home wheres his car anyway just dont see it folks i really want to be more specific but words escape me cats jumping on people a guy getting stabbed by corn cheesey lines up the proverbial wazoo just dont see it wait i take that back see it for writer stephen kings cameo as the guy who owns the graveyard hes actually pretty good even with guest appearances by mark hamill and ron perlman king gives the best performance of the film but other than thatwowbad
0,this is one of the funniest shows i have ever seen it is really refreshing to watch and i was in stitches many times i guess there is a social awareness factor to this too which makes it quite interesting if these were white girls would they get the same reaction maybe they would maybe they wouldnt the characters know no limits check my lyrics and do not exclude anyone from their twisted sense of funthere are so many funny sketches my favorites is the bob the builder one its so silly its genius if you like twisted black comedy then this is for you if you like keeping up appearances it probably isnt3 non blondes is yet another hilarious british bbc comedy shown on tv it is such a funny show and the characters unleashed on the unsuspecting public are laugh at loud funny it would be impossible to keep a straight face watching the crazy characters and the reactions of the public this series easily adds to the excellent comedies being produced
5,any film with a title as ridiculous as the bagman should automatically attract the attention of any bad movie lover but the plot is far different than what one may expect after viewing the dvd cover the bagman is by no means a good movie it falls into the category of films that seem to have been and probably were filmed on a home video camera the acting is awful i havent heard and seen such wooden acting since troll there are plenty of scenes with nudity and sex but they are clearly jumped into too fast the characters are morons and entirely forgettable the ending which i will not spoil can be easily anticipated after watching the very first scene due to the cheesy nature of the film nothing aside from the awful production values is truly scary awful attempts at realistic gore a driving scene where the car is clearly stationary etc recommended for bad movie aficionados only
6,seriously there is absolutely nothing good about this crap fest at all randolph scott a closet homosexual who lived with his lover cary grant for twelve years is at his most wooden and boring in the least role at 57 he was clearly far too old for these romantic roles although it doesnt matter so much here because gail russell looks so much older than her 31 years and she is so ugly due to her chronic alcoholism and chain smoking lee marvin plays his usual villainous role but it isnt enough to save this garbage thank god they dont make westerns any more theyre just dated racist old movies that glamorise guns and murderbr br 010
4,i recently watched belle epoque thinking it might be wonderful as it did win an oscar for best foreign language film i was a bit underwhelmed by the predictability and simplicity of the film maybe the conflict i had was that from the time the movie was filmed to now the plot of a man falling for beautiful women and eventually falling for the good girl has been done so many times aside from predictability of the plot some scenes in the film felt really out of place with the storyline ex a certain event at the wedding at times the film was a bit preachy in its ideas and in relation to the franco era the film was set in and the church the only thing the film had going for it was the cutesy moments the scenery and the character of violeta being a strong independent woman during times when women were not really associated with those characteristics
3,i had heard good things about this film and was you guessed it a bit disappointed reese witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good surprisingly confident at a young age really all the small cast are quite solid in their simple 50s american setting the reason i didnt rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end the grief shown by the older sister didnt seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer maureens character is quite underdeveloped i think it is understandable that dani reese w the younger would be traumatised and angry but why is her sister shown to be more upset because shes a few years older hasnt the end rather undermined the rest of the film the pacing of the movie makes it seem that maureen and court have only just met when he gets tractored warning this scene is surprisingly brutal in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit well it works it depends what you want  if you want the girls happy story of young love that it seems like youre going to get youre in for a surprise man in the moon is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film  a rather awkward combination i liked the character of court though i can see what girls watching this might be watching and i loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt the younger sister most men would most films wouldnt and get killedbr br 710 on my pretty harsh ratings scale for some reason i found jason london on a tractor funny
0,okay so someone somewhere a few years ago thought it would be a good idea to make a 3d imax movie about some flies stowing away aboard the apollo 11 and going to the moon so they did someone somewhere was an idiotbr br i want to give the artists props for doing their homework on the hardware as far as i can tell the rockets and the launch hardware were bang on the graphics in general were pretty good  the rocket launch gave me chills like a good rocket launch always does my popular mechanics flyingcar gearhead blood still runs strong and the 3d was pretty effective the cg wasnt pixarquality but it was generally good the flies were kinda mediocre anthropomorphics with some halfassed late60s characters thrown in for colour hippie flies africanamerican flies with giant afros and black shades etc and the maggots looked more like grubs with human baby heads although they made suitably gross squelching noisesbr br the scriptwriters certainly did not do their homework relying on offensive and outdated clichs 60s gender politics including mostlyuseless female characters racial stereotypes evil russians a fat fly who only wants to eat gradetwo level grossout humour in a movie aimed for imax they blew a wonderful opportunity to sneak in some educational content about physics and space travel  they didnt get their physics right zerog in the lunar module during landing burn please they couldnt even be bothered to read the original radio transcripts between houston and the astronauts all of which is in the public domain instead they wrote their own dialogue which sounds like crapbr br but we liked the maggotsbr br so they get a point and a half for rockets and maggots uh yay 155
5,if only all animation was this great this film is classic because it is strong is two simple aspects story and character the characters in this film are beautifully personified i felt for all of the characters and humananimal relationship in the movie works perfectly the beautiful animation and 3d computer animation hasnt worked better in any other film this is a great movie for kids and for adults who want a classic heros journey of 10
5,on the surface show me the money should have at least finished a full season you had the always entertaining william shatner as your host surrounded by a bakers dozen of beautiful leggy models collectively called the million dollar dancers you had knowledgeable contestants who had interesting stories to tell of their lives and who presumably knew a lot of pop culture trivia and you had big money so what went wrong br br the format of this game was the failure a good game show needs at least two of three things very simple rules exciting pacing and the ability for the viewer to play along at home the best most enduring ones have all threebr br unfortunately smtm had nonebr br the rules for this game were among the most complex of any prime time game show in history let me try to explain how the game worked as briefly as possiblebr br a contestant began with a single word or short phrase followed by the choice letters a b c subtle plug for the network each letter was connected to a separate question all starting with that word or phrase once a contestant chose one of the letters they could either answer that question or pass and select a second letter if they passed they got to view the next question and had the same option however if they passed the second question they were required to answer the third optionbr br after they answered and before they found out if their answer was correct they then had to select one of the 13 dancers on stage each with a different amount of money in a scroll by their side they revealed their dollar amount ranging from 20000 to 250000 and depending on if the contestant answered right or answered wrong that amount would be added to or subtracted from their potbr br still with me so far in addition there was one dancer who held something known as the killer card if you selected the dancer with the killer card and you had gotten your question right you were safe and the game continued if however you were incorrect you had one final question to answer if you got that final question wrong you were out of the game if you got it right then the game continuedbr br there was no quitting no walking away with the money earned until you either answered six questions correctly or got six questions wrong or you were so far in the hole you couldnt earn enough money to get back out got it okay br br the biggest problem as i saw it was a complete lack of tension because of the design of the game a contestant could pass questions they knew they didnt know and answer many questions they did know making the pressure even less then they could still find a low dollar amount even after knowingly missing a question which meant there still wasnt any drama and the fact that they could answer five questions wrong and still have a chance to win was a big mistake and the pacing of the questions was deadly slow often the questions were so obvious it was ridiculous to try to create tension as if there was any doubt about some of the most common answersbr br the pacing the lack of any real tension at any point during the show and those very complicated rules prevented this program from working despite shatners terpsichorean talents
6,dont read this review if you want the shocking conclusion of the crater lake monster to be a total surprisebr br a claymation plesiosaur rises from the depths of crater lake to wreak havoc on a group of local rednecks not to mention your fast forward button to call the crater lake monster amateurish is to overstate the obvious if you arent a fan of low budget drivein films you probably wouldnt be looking here in the first placebr br the problem with the movie is that when theres no monster action going on it really sucks and goes nowhere the script is very ed woodish in that its utterly contrived in the way it sets up the main action sequences nothing is too outlandish for the crater lake monster it explains its dinosaur by having a meteor crash into crater lake superheating the water to the point where it incubates a dinosaur egg that has apparently been resting at the bottom of the lake for millennia even if we could accept that the egg could have been lying there for so long and remained uncovered and viable wouldnt superheating the water to such a high temperature cause most of the lake to evaporate other than some token fog in one or two scenes we see no evidence of the water being hot other than a few lines in the scriptbr br the script is padded rather obviously in a few sequences and it will do anything to get the characters near the lake so that they can be menaced by the claymation dino a couple just passing through experiences car trouble and while their automobile is being serviced they decide to rent a boat and head out into crater lake hmmmmdo you think these strangers in the story could be there so they would run into our title monstrosity in a sequence thats just plain bizarre a drunk robs a liquor store and decides to murder the cashier and a bystander instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of booze a car chase ensues and wouldnt ya know itthey end up right by the lake snack time for cratey yeah its not hard to figure out and youre so far ahead of the script that youre irritated when it takes another ten minutes for these scenes to unfoldbr br the shamelessness of it all is endearing and i really want to like the crater lake monster i just cant do it theres not enough here to go on and this is more of a movie to put on during a party because you could talk right over it and it wouldnt matter br br the film has a slim list of the things going for it the most important being the dinosaur itself which appears in three forms a shadow puppet a large model head that is dragged woodenly through the water and a fully realized claymation insert that actually looks pretty good there are also a pair of lovable hicks in it and they carry the majority of the intentional humor in the movie a downbeat ending leaves us mourning the death of both the monster and one of our beloved hicks so every good thing about this film is dead by the end of it why was i so affected by this conclusion was it the mournful song played over the closing credits or was i just weeping inwardly for the time that i waste watching films like this
5,seriously i dont even know where to begin its like somebody gave a bazillion dollar budget to an autistic thirdgrader and said make me a movie about the secret service the editing is ridiculous the cinematography was random at best every single syllable of dialogue was completely retarded and the directing  well was there even a director there everything was just so pointless and lame and pointlessand randomand lamebr br heres a spoiler for you this movie is the dumbest thing youll ever see br br however if you liked this piece youll also enjoy deterrance dark blue and a partial frontal lobotomy
1,im not sure why this little film has been banished into obscurity as despite some rather silly goings on the sentinel is a clever and inventive horror film that gives most of the highly praised ghost stories of today more than a run for their money michael winner has admitted many times that hes not the best director of all time and that does shine through on a number of occasions with this film but it has to be said that the film works in spite of its uninspired direction and the fact that winner has somehow managed to round up a simply amazing cast of talent more than makes up for it the plot is rich with mystery and begins by focusing on alison parker and her hunt for a flat she finds that she cant afford most properties she looks at but thinks her luck has changed when she finds a fully furnished apartment for an affordable price her problems start soon after moving in as she doesnt like her neighbours very muchand this problem increases when the property broker tells her that she has just one neighbour an elderly blind priest on the top floorbr br the cast list is truly superb with the relatively unknown cristina raines heading up a great support cast chris sarandon is a little wooden in his role opposite raines but small parts for the likes of john carradine eli wallach ava gardner jeff goldblum and christopher walken to name but a handful more than make up for sarandons lifeless portrayal michael winner does a good job with his central location as the block of flats provides a creepy and macabre setting for the story the film is a little slow to start but its never boring and michael winners screenplay provides a surprise thats almost impossible to guess from the offset which certainly deserves some praise like many similar slowburning horrors this one doesnt go for the money shot early on  but unlike many the ending is a definite climax as winner goes all out to shock the viewer and if the rumour that he used actual human oddities is true ive got to say that he does a very good job at it overall while this film may be pure hokum whichever way you look at it the sentinel is one of the better films of its type and its definitely a major highlight for its director
5,this movie was okay but it certainly defeats the claim that homosexuals are born that way especially when a woman can exit out of an unhappy marriage and just fall into the arms of another woman it almost seems as if kates gender preferences turned on and off like a switch making this film seem a little simplisticbr br also as is common with films that are trying to push an agenda it was unfortunate that those characters in the film who had questions or disapproval over the gay lifestyle were labeled as bigots and there was no happy medium it was either kates friends and relatives totally embraced her or they totally shunned her this is not typical of interactions between gay and nongay relatives and friends it is usually a mixture of emotions and values that come into play it is possible to love people and treat them with respect while not necessarily condoning the choices they make sadly the movie showed none of these types of interactions for a movie trying to portray tolerance and acceptance it struck me as very intolerant movie then at the end kate apparently decides after all these years she wants to be with mac and everything is hunky dory  is that what being gay is really all about come on
5,this was one of the lamest movies we watched in the last few months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad acting mainly from the supporting characters the interview with hugh laurie on the dvd was actually more rewarding than the film itselfbr br hugh laurie obviously put a lot of effort into learning how to dance the samba but the scope of his character only required that he immerse himself at the kiddie end of the pool the movie is based on the appearance of a lovely girl and great music but these are not sufficient to make good entertainmentbr br if you have never seen rio or the inside of a british bank this film is for you out of 10
1,an absolutely wretched waste of film nothing ever happens no ghosts hardly any train no mystery no interest the constant and brutal attempts at comedy are painful everything else is pathetic the premise is idiotic a bunch of people stranded in the middle of noplace because their train was held up for less than minutes what and the railroad leaves them no place to stay in a heavy storm i think not oh they can walk miles across the deadblack fields umm yeah sure or they can force themselves on the railroads hospitality and stay at the haunted train station a station which proved to be nothing but deadly boring utterly without ghosts interest or plotbr br so very terribly dull that this seems impossiblebr br this ought to be added to the lost films list  aargh 
2,i came into this movie really wanting to line it i thought the premise had a lot of potential and was ripe for an interesting movie dont get me wrong here i wasnt expecting citizen kane i was taking this for the b movie that it is that said it still fell short of the expectation the historical aspect of the story is glazed over and the ending left me a bit cold the acting in the movie was very wooden all in all i give it for a great idea but the movie could have scored much higher with a bit more attention to movie making fundamentals is it worth seeing i didnt wish for my two hours back but i dont know that id recommend it to others
1,okay this is gona be short and sweet reviewsomething the movie should have taken a practice ina nd made its life shorter and sweeter than it wasbr br this movie is  theres a good reason there was a petition with over 40000  signatures all demanding uwe boll stop making movies from franchises people liked blood rayne being a biggie therebr br the jokes are goodif youve never heard them a thousand times before the acting is descent but u can really only blame the script for that i even a few moments wonder if theyre even using a scriptbr br the movie has little to nothing to do with the original games hello if youve played the games u know the main character has no real motivation outside homicidal urges like mass murder because he stubbed his toe or simular theres way too much story for such a stupid movie like i said i wouldnt even steal this movie and for the person who says this is  funniest movie of 2007need to take a look around the news is better than this
3,this film takes you on one familys impossible journey and makes you feel every step of their odyssey beautifully acted and photographed heartbreakingly real its last line with its wistful hope is one of the more powerful in memory
6,down to earth is the best movie it is so funny and its really sweet too it has a good plot and its unique it isnt like those movies that are all the same with the similar story lines and its not all comedy and no story this movie also has a very good ending
2,masters of horror the screwfly solution starts as america is being infected by an airborne virus that affects the male population when aroused men indiscriminately kill any woman in sight apparently in the name of god scientist alan jasn priestley is brought in by the government  knows more than most  senses the situation may have gone too far already so he tells his wife anne kerry norton to take their teenage daughter amy brenna obrien  try to survive as the future of the human race may depend on thembr br this canadian american coproduction was episode from season of the masters of horrror tv series directed by joe dante i thought the screwfly solution was pretty bad i personally think the script by sam hamm sucks it takes itself far too seriously  i dont really understand why its part of the masters of horror series the horror that the filmmakers are going for in the screwfly solution is in the actual story itself  themes  ideas it brings up rather than on screen visual horror particularly the tenuous ecological message it sees intent on ramming down our throats whenever its gets the chance during its short 60 odd minute running time which i felt itself was a problem as the thing just finishes out of what could easily be interpreted as necessity rather than any meaningful attempt to wrap things up i wasnt happy with the inconsistencies with the story either if men only kill when sexually aroused why does the flight attendant casually break that womans neck on the plane was he sexually aroused i think not why does every bloke then think hes killing in the name of god i just cant see every single bloke on earth suddenly knowing the bible  starting to believe in god i just found the notion ridiculous  the show also states clearly that theres nothing religious about whats going on so whats the deal with everyone thinking they have a divine to murder any woman they see then theres the fact people get turned on by different things what about gays for instance will they kill guys instead of women i know theres a brief scene which makes a joke out of the gay issue but its conveniently brushed to one side  then theres the thing which annoyed me the most the fact that presumably every bloke on earth has turned psycho  killed all the women they go about their everyday business like nothing ever happened it just felt so stupid the plotting is rubbish  to round things off theres a ending which looks like it was taken from a rejected episode of the xfiles 1993  2002 with a bright neon alienbr br director dante on this showing definitely doesnt qualify as a master of horror as far a im concerned the story is badly paced its just so stupid considering its played deadly straight  instead of trying to make a proper horror show he turns in more of a thriller with its deadly virus on the loose situation  the subsequent mother  daughter on the run because of it theres very little here in the way of what i would call effective horror  even less gore theres a scene when a woman is stabbed with a broken bottle a brief scene after when a guy stabs his own groin with said bottle  another woman is stabbed in the stomach but nothing else to write home aboutbr br technically like the other episodes its really good  it doesnt have the look of a cheap tv series the special effects are great as usual  its well made the acting is alright but noone really stood outbr br the screwfly solution is easily the worst masters of horror episode ive seen but bear in mind i havent seen all of them yet as a stand alone piece of entertainment it did nothing for me  as a show made by a socalled master of horror it disappoints me even more
3,i couldnt believe how lame  pointless this was basically there is nothing to laugh at in the movie hardly any scenes to get you interested in the rest of the movie this movie pulled in some huge stars but they were all wasted in my opinion i think keanu reeves mustve taken some acting lessons a fews years after this movie before he stared in the matrix uma thurman looked very simple  humble luckily i got this movie for a very low price because its certainly not a movie to remember for any good reasons i wont write anything about the story of the movie but as you should know that she is meant to be the most famous hitchhiker across america because of her huge thumb i would give this movie a  10 before i watched this movie i was wondering why this movie has only got a 4010  now i know why a very disappointing movie dont buy it even if you see it for under
0,this is a generally nice film with good story great actors and great songs the cinematography was unfortunately bad one of the films weakest points is the annoying chain of sequences copied from pretty woman why does it hurt to attempt some originality abbas mustan anyonebr br the film is about a newly married couple raj and priya salman  rani priya cannot conceive after an accident she had during the previous pregnancy and they finally decide to use a surrogate mother who will carry their child they pick madhubala a vulgar prostitute played by preity zinta the film is not really realistic i mean isnt it easier to adopt and even if they pick a girl does it mean the man has to sleep with her have you heard of insemination anyway i guess if the writers had heard of all this the film wouldnt have been made so the concept is apparently intentionalbr br salman acts very well its nice to see him playing a serious character but his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love to his wife and how hard he finds it to sleep with another woman come on its cheesy and unrealistic rani is just about ok she is generally effective and does try to do something with the role but gets completely overshadowed by preity zintabr br the film belongs to preity who steals the show in a big way with her flawless performance she makes the transformation from a loud prostitute to a sensitive woman easily and naturally she lives the film emotes and makes you love her and admire her at the same time partly because of her role partly because of her magnetic and positive personality this is one of her careerbest performances there is no doubt she is more talented than her industry contemporaries she just should do more such rolesbr br the films ending only highlights what i said above it is tearjerking exciting and very wellacted watch it for preitybr br 710 for the film 1010  for preity
7,the sunshine boys is one of my favorite feel good movies i first saw it when it as the christmas attraction at radio city music hall when it first came out and loved it ever since i ended up seeing it times in the theaters and if it was playing today id go out to see it againbr br now a lot of the reviews here mentioned the wonderful performances of the leads matthau was brilliant but had the misfortune of being nominated against jack nicholsons oscar winning performance of randall p macmurphy in one flew over the cuckoos nest burns did win though richard benjiman deserved at least to be nominated as well even the smallest roles were played to perfection like fritz feld auditioning for the potato chips commercial br br which brings me to my reason for reviewing this film the direction of the greatly underrated herbert ross ross who previously brought a two person play the owl and the pussycat to the screen and made a full movie out of it does it again he opens the plays out without making them look like a photographic stage play he fleashens out the story and the charactersbr br here were 20 minutes into the film before we get to the scene that opens the play where ben clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about the comedy special though there are dialogue from the play during the first twenty minutes the sequence itself is totally new a few years ago i did see at the broadway revival of the play with jack klugman and tony randall which was wonderful but i think that ross and screenwriter playwright simon improved on it its just a wonderful film
4, some spoilers br br this movie is sometimes subtitled life everlasting thats often taken as reference to the final scene but more accurately describes how dead and buried this onceestimable series is after this sloppy and illogical sendoffbr br theres a hey kids lets put on a show air about this telemovie which can be endearing in spots some fans will feel like insiders as they enjoy picking out all the various cameo appearances cowriter coproducer tom fontana and his pals pack the goingson with friends and favorites from other shows as well as real baltimore personagesbr br thats on top of the returns of virtually all the members of the televisions show varied casts your old favorites as well as later nonfavoritesbr br there was always a tugofwar pitting qualityconscious executive producer barry levinson fontana james yoshimura and the rest of the creative team against budgetconscious nbc execs who simply wanted a another moronic police procedural like nash bridges which regularly beat homicide in the ratings the pressure told as the show bounced between riveting realism that transcended its form and sleazy sensationalism that demeaned itbr br unfortunately for this movie fontana cowriters yoshimura and eric overmeyer and director jean de segonzac simply threw in the towel they took the most ludicrous story are from the series topped it with an unlikely and artistically unfruitful new plot line and laid the burden of carrying the whole mess on one of the weaker cast membersbr br briefly some time has passed since the last episode of the show the former heart of baltimores homicide unit yaphet kotto as lt al giardello is now a kurt schmokelike candidate for mayor and schmoke himself makes a cameo appearance but this promising start immediately and improbably takes a tragic turnbr br the spotlight shifts to giancarlo esposito as giardellos son mike a handsome man who has done good work elsewhere esposito was one of the pretty faces brought in late to supposedly enliven the tv series but the question for viewers always was is mike that uncomfortable as gees son or is esposito that uncomfortable in the rolebr br to be fair esposito doesnt get a chance to play out the main story without interruption thats because the writers choose this moment to revive another storyline that spat on the intelligence of the shows loyal votersbr br an apparent snuff streaming video was promoted and then seemed to actually take place on the internet after some red herrings the detectives arrested a repellent suspect but zaljko ivaneks harassed and overworked deputy states attorney forgot to file motions in time and the suspect was released only to be murdered laterbr br lets summarize he forgot to file the paperwork because it wasnt the most sensational case of his career because the mayor the attorney general the governor the entire maryland legislature the us attorney general nbc court tv the bbc ap reuters people the sun the washington post the new york times the la times time magazine the times of london the economist the johannesburg mail and guardian losservatore romano le figaro paris match lequipe and computer world werent calling every 10 minutes to ask about the status of the casebr br nevertheless the old gang of detectives and associates flocks back to baltimore to help out theres quite an array of talent on display unfortunately with the limited amount of dialogue to hand out some of them are merely on displaybr br two of the strongest actors clark johnson and melissa leo are criminally underused while time wasted on jon seda and michael michelle could be better spent on commercials the writers do seem to satirize this presenting jason priestley as the latest bigdeal detective on the other hand they give easycome easygo michelle forbes a very affecting scenebr br theres some other sly casting with actual lt gary daddario the center of the book that gave rise to the show playing another detective guests drop in from other shows like whitney allen doing her deadpan and clueless miss sally from the childrens show beloved by the inmates on fontanas oz dina napoli of wbal tv turns up as herself br br even when entertaining though these guests can be distracting ed begley jr actually advances the story in his brief appearance playing dr victor ehrlich from fontanas st elsewhere hes still a vivid character and fits in a hospital setting then you remember didnt st elegius turn out to be an autistic boys fantasybr br the most useful cameo reflects corporate synergy this movie was made when court tv bought rerun rights to the series that network contributed legal waif helen lucaitis who had interviewed the homicide team and later appeared on oz the tv correspondent does an efficient job summarizing the news that is plot points for latecomersbr br although shes so thin that she disappears when she turns sideways lucaitis also adeptly handles a bit of physical comedy with esposito he shows more juice in his scenes with lucaitis than with any of his usual colleagues perhaps those two should have done a spinoffbr br as the movie winds down the cream of the cast rises to the top although they are saddled with a loser script andre braugher and kyle secor overcome it their performances remind viewers what made homicide for considerable stretches the best show on the air and one of the best television productions everbr br its fun to watch top pros do their stuff its just a shame this movie doesnt give them more of a chance diehard fans may want to see this movie anyway but you can live without it
6,it is obviously illegal pedophiles pray on stuff like this how did they get away with making such a movie this movie is all summed up in one word sick where do people get off making and watching these kinds of films as i was watching the movie i didnt actually think they would allow this kid that is say maybe 12 if that actually sleep with this woman sorry if this is a spoiler to you but i would have rater not seen this where has the sanity of these people gone maybe the makers of this movie are pedophiles our society today is filled with all types of sexual predators that pray upon children yet film makers make these types of movies that do nothing but provoke this type of behavior i noticed that on a previous comment someone asked if there was a version where it showed them naked this is a kid here and someone is asking something like this what is wrong with this picture
1,or released on dvd or screened on a cable channel like amer life tv network i have been watching another favorite voyage to the bottom of the sea as well as lost in space and land of giants theyve been showing them forever but arent receptive to suggestions for other shows my father and i were big fans as i was already a big scienceelectronics nut still am and my father was an old school chum of nader they both attended oxy together i still have memories of several of the episodes even though i was only more so than any show that old i think it was televised on sat after bonanza some of the episodes i recall are the one where he takes the experimental drug that slows down action or the one where he body surfs the big ones i did that too or the one where there was a mine cave in and he conveys how to use mind control to have the trapped people slow their breathing by entering a trancelike state that is the one show that i wish i could see again i got my wish with the original outer limits and scifi theaterjohn
4,i think it unfortunate that the leading comments on this movie include the words clueless and appalling nonsense i think it is a very funny movie and excellent entertainment one has to suspend ones disbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman could fall in love have a child and live together happily ever after but it is always wonderful to see it played out in a movie and have ones heart warmed is it so impossible there are far more implausible events described in other movies the acting is good the script is funny the only negative comment is that the story could well have ended when the family drives away from its initial house instead of extending on to explore whether the man retains any residual homosexuality
1,anyone who has experienced the terrors of divorce will empathize with this indie films protagonist a scared little boy who believes a zombie is hiding in his closet is jake a mesmerizing anthony demarco simply transferring the trauma of two bickering parents to an understandable image or could the creature be real writerdirector shelli ryan neatly balances both possibilities and keeps the audience guessing her choice of using one setting  a suburban house  adds to the feeling of desperation and claustrophobiabr br brooke bloom and peter sean bridgers are highly convincing as the angry but loving parents however it is the creepy minor characters mrs benderbarbara gruen an unhinged babysitter and sam stone ben bode a sleazy real estate agent that linger in the mind jakes closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of hell
2,hard to believe that director barbet schroeder once did the majestic and very funny maitresse 1976 and now only seems to do by the numbers hollywood thrillersbr br this is very lightweight john grisham material crossed with the plot of a tv movie bullock is cass mayweather a feisty and independent crime investigator specialising in serial killers ben chaplin is her reserved police partner sam kennedy and together they make an uncomfortable duo not good when two unbalanced college maladriots gosling and pitt decide to send them on a wild goose chase  by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scenebr br fair enough but while bullock and chaplin fail to create any sparks we also have to endure a several dull overlymelodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in casss history then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliffside log cabin where theres absolutely no doubt the ott ending will be set oooh the atmospherebr br watch any episode of csi instead its to the point and far more exciting
1,if you have any clue about jane austens production youll now that she repeats the same in each of her novels marriage marriage and marriage in my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bit boring but i like austens characters because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings they like to repeat as also in emma the thing that makes emma good is gwyneth paltrow shes very good in her leading role also the fact that each one of the characters in the movie dont seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious
6,i wish kids movies were still made this way dark and deep there was get this character development and charlie is the epitome of the dynamic character plot development superb animation emotional involvement and a rational relatable and consistent theme if not for the handful of songanddance routines you would never have thought this was a kids movie and this is why i give it such a high rating this movie is an excellent film let alone for a kids movie which brings me to my second point this has got to be the darkest kids movie ive seen in quite some time this coming from a 22yearold id be shocked to see any child under the age of not completely terrified throughout a great deal of the latter half and some of the first half of the movie and it all ends with one of the saddest endings you could ever come across ala jurassic bark for those of you who are futurama fans and this is what makes this movie so good just because the movie universally evokes emotions we dont normally like to feel and assume are bad does not make the movie itself bad in fact it means it succeeded good funny movies are supposed to make us laugh good horror movies are supposed to make us scared good sad movies are supposed to make us sad my point is good movies are supposed to move you not simply entertain this movie moved mebr br also this movie is incredibly violent by todays standards for a kids movie and contains subject matter that by todays standards may not be suitable for some children parents id say watch it first im not usually one to say anything about this kind of thing but i just saw this yesterday and it came as a surprise even to me
7,this is one of the funnier films ive seen it had its crude moments but they were full of charm its altmanesque screenplay brilliant physical humour and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch and a slice of life most of us can relate to and i can say with a measure of honesty that i was afraid for steve carells nipplei truly was surprisingly this is a goodnatured unabashed comedy that is essentially about love and the many relationships we may find ourselves in along the way catherine keener was terrific as trish and all of steve carells friends were flawed but amiable and so much fun the idea that they suspected that carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a fortyyear old virgin but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first original charming and very funny highly recommended
5,simply put oliver is one of the greatest musicals of all time it is filled with memorable songs  food glorious food oliver consider yourself and oompahpah to name just a few  and equally memorable charactersbr br the film is a musical adaptation of charles dickens classic novel and much like the story of oliver twist itself it is a perfect family film there are some frightening moments  the villain bill sykes played by oliver reed is scary enough on his own  but overall the film will appeal to children of all ages as well as adultsbr br the story  which almost everyone is surely familiar with by now  revolves around a little orphan boy named oliver and his life growing up in london at first he lives in the workhouse with the rest of his fellow orphans but after daring to question mr bumble the overseer he is sold to a family as a servantbr br after a series of mishaps and close shaves he meets the artful dodger  superbly played by a young jack wild who gives his all in the role  and through him the greedy fagin ron moody who trains young boys to pick pocket treasures which he keeps for himselfbr br the film was shot solely in studios and on soundstages at shepperton film studios but this does not translate at all to film the sets perfectly replicate victorian london as do the costumes worn by the characters a multioscar winner and a massive success on its release oliver is a worthy contender for the best musical all of time and will delight anyone who loves film
0,i see quite a few positive reviews on this board trying to revive this film from its lackluster status and starting a cult following i see the usual rantingi guess this movie is just not for the easily offended this movie is not shakespeare etc guess what neither was road trip and i laughed my a off during that movie theres a way to make a crude tasteless comedy and deliver laughs and theres a way tojust make it crude and tasteless whipped tries to be swingers without the wit or intelligence it seems to have been written through the puerile eyes of a 14yearold boy for gods sake the characters in this movie are supposed to be whitecollar upright citizensand they talk like some of the idiots i knew in freshman year of high school the dialogue is lacedmore like drownedwith fourletter words you would think that people of their status would have some degree of intelligenceand a more extensive vocabulary just watch a whit stillman film and youll see the difference not to mention the fact that the dialogue sounds totally unrealistic and downright cartoonish if you know any successful whitecollar businessmen who speak like the characters in this movieplease let me know and introduce me to them their annoying sexual banter is equivalent to that of standard locker room chat among teens just arriving at puberty there is absolutely no insight into relationships sex oranything its just a poor excuse to showcase an array of extremelyand dont take the word extremely for granted because i mean it with all my heartcrude gags these are gags with no substance gags that are meant more for groans than laughs the scene at the end between amanda peet and her girlfriends was totally uncalled for and totally unconvincing there are some movies that involve interaction among females that were written by straight men and play out wonderfully this scene involves a barrage of sexual metaphors and gestures it involves the kind of dialogue you can never imagine leaving a womans mouth it was one of those noticeablywrittenbyaguy scenes i wasnt believing it for a second br br whipped is purely a sick male fantasy thats as flat as it is annoying i got very few laughs out of this utterly forgettable comedy and those were probably a result of desperation when youre not laughing for a long period of time you desperately look for humor in the most trivial things so i wouldnt mark that down as a positive
0,if you havent already seen this movie of marykate and ashleys then all i can say is what are you waiting for this is yet another terrific and wonderful movie by the fraternal twins that we all know and love so much its fun romantic exciting and absolutely breathtaking scenerywise of course as always marykate and ashley are the main scenery here anyway would any true fan want it any other way of course not anyway its a great movie in every sense of the word so if you havent already seen it then you just have to now i mean right now too so what are you waiting for i promise that you wont be disappointed sincerely rick morris
5,this is only the second time ive felt compelled enough to comment at imdb about a film the first time was for probably the best movie ive ever seen and that was for mementobr br seeing darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to memento as in the worst film ive had the misfortune to see apart from the two scenes containing naked women there is nothing in this movie to raise it from the trashpile that it isbr br lets see apalling effects cliched script bad acting and about 90 minutes too long my wife and i laughed through most of it in disbelief at how bad amazingly i watched it to the end how i did that i dont know avoid
5,released in december of 1957 sayonara went on to earn oscar nominations and would pull in wins red buttons won the oscar for best supporting actor in his role as airman joe kelly who falls in love with a japanese woman while stationed in kobe during the korean war oscar nominated for best leading actor marlon brando plays major lloyd gruver a korean war flying ace reassigned to japan who staunchly supports the militarys opposition to marriages between american troops and japanese women and tries without any success to talk his friend joe kelly out of getting married ironically marlon brandos character soon finds love of his own in a woman of japanese descent this movie highlights the prejudices and cultural differences of that time filmed in beautiful color and with stunning backgrounds i found this movie to be well worth watching just for these effects alone good movie gimme moregimmeclassics
3,such a masterpiece as the first of these two snowy river films was the sequel to the man from snowy river is everything that a followup should be it does not tread on the toes of its predecessor preferring to leave the legend that was the first film live on in some unique immortalitybr br the man from snowy river ii is based upon the return of jim craig to the snowy river country after a three year absence the film subtly tells a tale of change in the nineteenth century of australian history legend and horses the storyline demonstrates a touch of hollywood in lighter shades an aspect that was absolutely absent in the first film yet this blends uniquely with the a distinct sense of australian patriotism the plot is far more vibrant than the first film and much more showy with particular aspects of the previous incorporated into the film yet the man from snowy river ii possesses every essential characteristic of the first film sensationally beautiful cinematography a stunning focus of the australian high country the second most impressive footage of horses ever filmed and a fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack by bruce rowland which equals the first in every way geoff burrowes has done a superb job with this film and it is highly worthy of recognition especially with regard to the quality of the australian film industry the lead cast from tom burlinson to sigrid thornton and a wellreplaced brian dennehy carry off their parts with as much passion and distinction as the first film as far as sequels can go the man from snowy river ii is a masterpiece a deeply moving and inspirational experience yet again
5,warning possible spoilers but not really  keep reading ahhh there are so many reasons to become utterly addicted to this spoof gem that i wont have room to list them all the opening credits set the playful scene with kitsch late 1950s cartoon stills an enchanting peres prez prado mambo theme which appears to be curiously uncredited but his grunts are unmistakable and noone else did them and with familiar cast names including kathy najimi a full year before she hit with sister acts  plus teri hatcher from tvs supermanbr br every scene is imbued with shallow injustices flung at various actors actresses and producers in daytime tv peeking behind the careers of these people is all just an excuse for an oldfashioned delicious farce robert harling penned this riotous spoof that plays like an issue of mad magazine but feels like a gift to us in the audience some of the cliched characters are a bit dim but everyone is drizzling with high jealousy especially against celeste talbert sally field who is the shows perennial awardwinning lead nicknamed americas sweetheart the daytime emmieslike awards opening does introduce us to celestes show the sun also sets against all vain fears to the contrary celeste wins again she is overjoyed because its always such a genuine thrill adam did you watch i won well nguh the reason for adams absence soon becomes the justification for the entire plot and were instantly off on a trip with celestes neuroses she cries screeches and wrings her hands though the rest of the movie while her dresser tawnee kathy najimi constantly waddling after celeste unseen through celestes fog of paranoia indulges a taste for tammy faye baker for which tawnee had been in fact specifically hiredbr br rosie schwartz whoopi goldberg has seen it all before she is the head writer of the show and she and celeste have been excellent support networks to each other for 15 years so when celeste freaks rosie offers to write her off the show for six months well just say that maggie went to visit with the dalai lama but celeste has doubts i thought that the dalai lama moved to la well then some other lama fernando lamas come on such a skewering line must be rather affronting to still living beefcake actor lorenzo lamas son of aforementioned fernando lamas d 1982br br those who can remember the economics teacher ben stein in ferris buellers day off 1986 as he deadeningly calls the roll bueller bueller bueller will take secret pleasure from seeing him again as a nitwit writer other well hidden member of the cast include garry marshall in real life mr happy days and brother of penny who gets paid 12 million to make the command decisions on the sun also sets  he says he definitely likes peppy and cheap and carrie fisher as betsy faye sharon whos a bitchbr br geoffrey anderson kevin kline is the yummywithaspoon and he is by the way dinner theater actor now rescued from his hell by david seaton barnes robert downey jr and brought back to the same show he was canned from 20 years earlier of course this presents some logical challenges for the current scriptwriters because his character rod randall was supposed to have been decapitated all those years ago somehow they work out the logical difficulties and geoffrey anderson steps off the choochoobr br celeste can now only get worse and her trick of going across the washington bridge no longer helps first her hands shake as she tries to put on mascara but she soon degenerates into a stalker unfortunately she cannot get rid of geoffrey anderson so easily geoffreys been promised development of his oneman play about hamlet and he means to hold the producer to that promise im not going back to florida nohow argues geoffrey you try playing willie loman in front of a bunch of old farts eating meatloaf  and indeed seeing geoffreys dinner theater lifestyle amongst all the hocking and accidents is hilarious back in florida in his willie loman fat suit in his room geoffrey anderson used to chafe at being called to stage as mr loman he was forced to splat whatever cockroaches crawled across his tv with a shoe and to use pliers instead of the broken analog channel changer now he find himself as the yummy surgeon dating laurie craven the shows new ingenue so hes not leavingbr br beautiful elizabeth shue as laurie rounds out the amazing ensemble cast who all do the fantastic job of those who know the stereotypes all too well but of course the course to true love never did run smoothly montana moorehead cathy moriarty is getting impatient waiting for her star to rise and is getting desperate for some publicitybr br will her plots finally succeed will celeste settle her nerves or will she kill tawnee first will the producer get mr fuzzy youll just have to watch  the second half  of this utterly lovable farcically malicious riotbr br and youll really have to see to believe how the shortsighted geoffrey reads his lines without glasses live off the teleprompter if you are not in stitches with stomachheaving laughter and tears pouring down your face feel free to demand your money back for the video rental soapdish 1991 is an unmissable gem that you will need to see again and again because its not often that a movie can deliver so amply with so many hilarious lines this is very wellcrafted humor almost all of it in the writing a draw with blazing saddles 1974 for uproarious apoplexy value although otherwise dissimilar watch it and weep a happy source for anyones video addiction 10 out of 10
6,first what i didnt like the acting was not really up to the hamlet standard branagh was really overthetop doing a lot of yelling mostly in my opinion those actors who were not bigname celebrities generally did a better job though i would except billy crystal and robin williams and charlton heston too but i wasnt sure if he was playing at being a hack a lot of the ambiguities in the play were clearly resolved one way in the flashbacksbr br what i think speaks very much in this plays favor is that it is accessible shakespeare is hard to understand for the vast majority of people nowadays many people are not even inclined to try because of its reputation as serious literature and its archaic english if they see this film they will understand clearly at least one mans interpretation of the play they will be seeing it more as shakespeares audiences saw it a play with sword fights and battles and mighty kings and nobles murder and incest and evil schemes and ghostsand great art if one cares to look for it but in shakespeares day most didnt any more than most people do now branaghs overacting and his forcing of his interpretation of the story on the viewer may detract from shakespeares art somewhat but it is better that modern audiences get a piece of it rather than nothingbr br ive got to say one more thing though some people are complaining that its set in the 19th century and that wasnt shakespeares time well in shakespeares time their costume and scenery was that of their own day for all of their plays shakespeare may have said its in the days of ancient rome or medieval denmark or whatever but he didnt dress his characters up like they were he used the costumes of his own time for the same reason his plays are full of anachronisms for example in king john the english and french have cannonsin robin hoods day in julius caesar they talk of chimneys which wouldnt be invented for another thousand years and in henry iv they talk about machiavelli who wasnt even born yet then so i think this objection is sillyyou might as well complain that the play isnt in danish after all they live in denmark dont they
0,this 2003 made for tv movie was shown on a womens channel naturally as a man why do i even attempt to watch this i dont know but i should have my head examined and director and writer simon gornick should be ashamed of himself to give men an injustice as he does he takes away any strength and conviction a man could have by having several boring women do him in number one bore is joyce hyser as the wife i couldnt wait for him to drop her her revenge was silly and stupid and very confusing through most of the movie the other femme fatale was nichole hiltz about the coldest person youd ever want to meet her looks didnt warrant our leading man to go that ape over her and her acting was so obvious only a fool could miss definitely a loser tembi locke was pretty good but slow on the uptake as to the slut seducing her own husband again played as a guy who is a loser by david deluise rounding out our cast of losers is anthony denison as a boss who has little to do but scowl at our hero stephen jenkins as our hero or should i say victim was not that good at first i thought he just a bad actor but later i believed it he never got the part off the ground and was repetitive throughout although as a man i became enraged when the two women got away with it men beware of this channel that puts men down and women get away even with murder lmn is the channel beware note having watched this a second time by mistake i am convinced on my initial thoughts especially on the writerdirector simon gornick i still believe he has disgraced the male species and should be horse whipped only saving grace in this film is tembi locke who doesnt have a chance to show her talents with the awful acting of jenkins hyser hiltz and deluise around her plus the stupid plot that only makes it worse down with gornicks movie and his vacant stars in it please lmn dont show this trite again
0,while some scenes of training were realistic too many of them depicted military instructors as exnazi types obviously the people who wrote the screen play were either antimilitary types or writing a film for that audiencebr br i am a viet nam vet and even during this period military instructors who behaved in the manner some of these did would probably still be serving time in military prisonbr br and i really loved the scene where the hero and his buddy both privates are sitting down in the captains office smoking cigarettes and talking and cussing with the captain as if he were their buddy this sort of thing never happened in training or in a formal situation as was the purpose for the scenebr br at the end i asked myself what was this film about as it seemed to wander around all over the place with no focus except i hate all authority thank god i got it from the library and did not pay to rent it
4,i once used wesley snipes name as a clue to go ahead and watch a new untried film in which he appears so now for the first time my snipesmethod of film recommendation has failed utterly i should first have come here to see these reviewsbr br snipes ought to be ashamed to allow his otherwise earnest efforts to be so wasted in the contractorbr br one of my worst flick fears has come to bitter fruition i feared that the shaky blurry pseudodocumentary unconsidered directing and editing style first brought to my attention by the paul greengrassdirected bloody sunday might propagate to other films greengass sickening style was then brought to nauseatingly new heights in the last two of the bourne trilogy films my fear had come to pass in my opinion these films are made really bad by these motionsicknessinducing methods which mistake blurry swipes for actionenhancement but the bourne franchise as greengrass so loving calls his cash cow apparently convinced others in hollywood to go unprofessional in the quest for fast big bucksbr br read my lips you hollywood types action needs to be clearly photographed and presented not merely hinted at by poor lazy cinematographic techniquesbr br and the contractor goes so far as to emulate the bourne ultimatum in inanelyrepeated sound bites in hopes their juvenile apparentlyevaluated audiences cant sense them for example if i hear a cop radio crackling yankeeromeo one more time ill just scream the chances are good i wont hear it again i certainly wont ever view the contractor againbr br i recommend to those of you who have yet to see the contractor just be content with the tranquility this lack affords to your lifebr br out of 10 i am tempted to lower that to a
7,when i decided to watch the barbarians starring those twin bodybuilders peter and david paul i thought it couldnt be that bad because the film was directed by ruggero deodato who has a reputation for creating sleazy movies but well made sleazy movies well the barbarians is remarkably trashy actionadventure movie that wants to be another conan the barbarian and fails at every level the look of the film is all wrong some scenes were well shot but the tone and the schintzy tacky disco look of the clothes and hair people are adorned with just doesnt make any sense whatsoever even for a low budget flick like this onebr br richard lynch looks like an old woman with that ridiculous hairdo and costume hes supposed to be menacing but he comes across as a buffoon and its funny to see eva larue callahan one of the stars of all my children appear in her first movie walking around in skimpy fur bikini im sure she wants this dreck to disappear from the face of the earth the socalled barbarian twins are okay as the muscle bound heroes but its almost impossible to construct a proper critique of their acting because their roles are like everything else in this mess really illconceived the only way the film tries to differentiate one twin from the other is by having one twin wear a loincloth that covers his ass while the other twins loincloth barely covers his muscular butt im not kidding dont ask me whos who thoughbr br deodato must have been really desperate to agree to make this film and his desperation is reflected perfectly in this trashy flick its just bad
1,the dialogue was pretty dreadful the plot not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist it presents not visually stunning actually visually annoying at times most definitely one of those films you find easier to finish if you keep one finger on the fast forward button if you could watch it for free have absolutely no other options open at the moment and you really dig seeing the little poltergeist lady well maybe id recommend it to you but not anyone else i could think of at the moment
5,while i have never been a fan of the original scoobydoo due to its horrid production values it appears like shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by hannabarbera without a doubt scrappydoo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children and this includes the teletubbies as well as tommy the tapeworm whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and enable it to speak and then saddle the scoobydoo characters with it whoever it is deserves to die or watch this show i think death is preferable the bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny annoying and grates on the nervesand this is only in the better episodes after many years it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess i can see why in the liveaction scoobydoo movie they made the villain scrappydoosince practically everyone hates him
3,despite louis b mayer reportedly not being interested in signing the young greta garbo to a contract this first american and mgm film for the actress looked quite beautiful its obvious that the film was assigned some amazing talent to film the production and make matte paintings as it has all the nice polish and artfulness youd expect from the best pictures the studio could produce it simply looks beautifuleven 84 years laterbr br as for garbo herself like her other very early american films she too looks different while shes quite recognizable her makeup is much softer than it would become just a year latergiving her a less severe look and a gentleness about her you just didnt see in subsequent films i kind of wish theyd kept this look but considering how famous shed become with the trademark look who am i to say they shouldnt have gone that route the film is about garbo and how she and her family are unfairly forced off their land by the landlord while the landlady the much esteemed doa bernarda claims its because the bank has demanded payment its because her son has fallen for garboand what better way to get rid of her than to force them out on the streets nice lady huh years pass and by now garbo has become a new singing sensation who is worldfamous when she returns to her hometown years later her old boyfriend who had promised to marry her but wimped out when his mother doa bernarda refused to allow it sees her his new love for another lady is now testedwill he be content to marry this lady who is the heir to a huge pig fortune or will he want his old flame and more importantly will garbo even take him back after he behaved so spinelessly in the meantime a huge rainstorm hits the land begins to flood and homes soon are being washed away by the deluge cortez and a friend make a mad dash as the dam breaks in a scene where they obviously superimposed his row boat over the cascading stream he eventually makes it out alive and to the home where garbo is now staying she welcomes them inside and they stay with her until the storm passes then he admits that he still loves her and had braved the storm to make sure that she was safe she tells him to get lost next you see ricardo about to get married to his second choice the daughter of the pork king he obviously has little enthusiasm for thisand you feel sorry for the lady as she did nothing wrong soon cortez is seen wandering back to garbos homehes lovesick and needs her in this scene garbo is quite luminous and cant tell him to leaveas they dissolve in each others arms once again he tells her of his love for herbr br when doa bernarda learns of this she is not pleased evidently a pork queen is a better catch than an internationally known singer because of the meddling of this nasty old lady garbo leavesunwilling to come between the mother and her wimpy son but cortez comes runningannouncing he must have her and wont rest until he has her as his wife moments after making this proclamation a family friend talks to cortez and convinces him to give her up for the good of his career and reputation so much for wont rest until he has her for his wife huh despite cortez being a wimp through and through for some reason she cannot bring herself to hate him and so he marries the pork queen and lives a very dull life when years later garbo meets cortez again he is a dull looking middleaged manwhile she is as beautiful as ever and not surprisingly she tells him once again to get lostbr br at the time this film was made garbo was not a star in the us and cortez was so in light of this its surprising they gave cortez such an unlikable character to play instead of the usual confident valentinolike role theyd been giving him here he is an indecisive wimpa huge wimp and from here on his career was on a slow downward spiral as for garbo the role helped establish her as a big staras she was the focus of the film and played a character much like her later personasbr br as for the film the new music composed for it was very nice though a tad repetitive the print oddly was nearly perfect throughout except for the intertitle cardswhich could use some restorationbr br a most enjoyable filmexpertly constructed wistful and worth seeing and for one of the few times i can think of it i have no real complaints in this excellent film
7,if you go see this movie youll be holding a grudge against the movie theatre the director the producer the actors and the person that told you to go see it shame on you sarah michelle geller for putting your name and face to this poor excuse of a movie it may have been more scary if the japanese actors would have just spoken in japanese instead of attempting to act in english i wanted to boo when the movie endeda true disappointment after all of the hype on tv and movie trailers promoting this lame money maker sarah michelle really didnt have to act at all to make this movieshe just practiced her frowning skills dont waste your time or money on this film
4,there has never been anything like it thats for sure this episodic seemingly redundant trilogy only really makes sense taken as a whole and as such it is not a movie about groovin gary utah crossdressing sensation it is very selfconsciously a film about how the filmmaker reacts to groovin gary for harris the entire project is clearly an extended and spectacular contortion of guilt and repentance hes trying to atone for his sins  yes gary did attempt suicide after the initial doc was aired  through correction commentary and convention reclaiming such hollywoodnarrative standbys as the best friend and the defiant happy ending two different ones with a telling adjustment in the glover version and turning them to his own very personal uses so while thematically it remains a movie about gender and difference the structure ensures that it is also a movie about movies  but on an almost unprecedented level of complexity there is just so much going on in telling and retelling this story harris is in the right place at the right time three times in a row and he doesnt miss the opportunity to make something of it immensely moving and as profound as camp ever gets
2,i first watched this film when i was a kid and is the only time in my life that i can remember putting my hands over my face and eyes in utter horror at one particular scene i remembered it again with a disscusion with my uni friends and promptly bought it on video with plenty of hesitation i might add to my surprise i only found it on the web in the states when it was made in england when i watched it again my reaction and to my surprise was almost the same of sheer horror and fear and never has my heart been beating so much too this is in my opinon the scariest film ever made hollywood films seem tame in comparison and a bit pony and trap crap pardon the pun what is amazing though is the power of this film and at uni when watching this with about twenty of my associates i have never heard so many screams blokes as well even the sight of the video brings the fear of god into me of that one particular scene and left me feeling that i will never walk alone again in the dark
1,stupid mindless drivel about a jet assembled within hours by mechanics who have never worked on airplanes piloted by burgess meredith chasing a porsche race car which runs on decadesold gasoline sludge driven by lee majors with chris makepeace as the runaway technowiz who can mcgyver spare parts into a radio receiver which can pick up all frequencies simultaneously and who somehow learned how to acquire and use chemicals to make high explosives in a perfectly peaceful society as moronic as it sounds terrible waste of burgess meredith but chris makepeace may at least be forgiven on the grounds that this was only his second film
5,i remember seeing this years ago when it first came out and i was floored by parker poseys performance and the movie was pretty good also for anyone whos spent a little too much time in the nightclubafterhours scene this movie will have a special charm for you not too serious mostly funny and parker posey definitely blazes her talented way through this indie gembr br i especially liked the diaz character reminded me of every single struggling dj ive ever known and many other movies could take a cue from this movie on how to preach the virtue of responsibility without being boring and bland about itbr br babaganoosh
5,what the hell is this kooky drama lawyers in loony tunes land the worlds thinnest most duckfaced actress even more duckfaced and anorexic than michelle pfeiffer overacts her bony butt off making cretinous grimaces that would shame bugs bunny in one of the most animated nonanimated tv series ever this is also the most annoying onehourformat tv show ever hence the worstbr br all the men act like pansies and i for one refuse to believe that even hip bigcity shysters are all as deltamalelike as this sorry short bunch wuss peter macnicol manages to be even more irritating than calista flockofducks with his fake hollywood shshshs speech impediment its the sort of pseudoinability to pronounce the letter s by turning it into a moronic sh that the likes of jon shtewart and christian shlater also practice with zeal watching macnicol talk i always wonder how come his jaw doesnt dislocate human facial anatomy was never meant to support the pronouncing of the sh sound more than three times per second he is a medical wonderbr br this badly conceived and written legaldramacomedy hodgepodge also features some very 90s pc it has political correctness written with huge neon letters is there anything more unrealistic than a bunch of lawyers being full of ideals high principles and moral fiber laughable but thats the way defense lawyers have been portrayed in hollywood since its inception after all what is more noble than defending a murderer a rapist or a thief when a tv series as retarded as ally mcbeak starts preaching to america about how it should run the country then it must be time for paris hilton to become president ally mcquack is both a product of recent and largescale western dumbingdown and a perpetrator of itbr br those supposed touches of eccentricity like the unbelievably annoying musical numbers are unconvincing and embarrassingly unfunny this is no monty python whatever new the talentfree makers of this garbage were aiming for they failed with honours ally mcbeak is a highly commercialized tv venture aimed at indiscriminating yuppies bored housewives and bipolar lawyers its yet another dull objection overruled sustained your honour may i call the witness legalistic baloney that the american audiences seem to eat up with relish for some strange reason
6,i really like this show that is why i was disappointed to learn recently that george lopez is a racist and that he fired masiela lusha off the show simply because he discovered that she wasnt a latino emigrant but was an emigrant from albania i learned this from people on the show she was really one of the better parts of the show and thus to learn that even among those who you would think would be sensitive to racism that they can also hate someone just because of the country where they were born is really disappointing i really like this show that is why i was disappointed to learn recently that george lopez is a racist and that he fired masiela lusha off the show simply because he discovered that she wasnt a latino emigrant but was an emigrant from albania i learned this from people on the show she was really one of the better parts of the show and thus to learn that even among those who you would think would be sensitive to racism that they can also hate someone just because of the country where they were born is really disappointing
2,woody allen made september proving that even a genius could screw up this is mel brooks september monumentally stupid boring and unfunny i must confess i did not watch it through to the end the flick ranks among the dishonored few eg the money pit out to sea spitfire grill which either put me to sleep or forced me to reach for the rewind button and i say this sadly as a devoted mel brooks fan he should stick to straight comedy and leave social commentary alone how the same fellow that made young frankenstein and spaceballs could crank out a dog like this is beyond me to be avoided at all costs
6,whilst i have loved haunted house movies such as amityville and poltergeist this made for tv adaption of susan hills book packs a huge punch on the horrors of hollywoodbr br with a brilliant cast many of which star in heartbeat and other tv dramas great acting and fantastic setting which portrays 1920s life convincingly it has all the right ingredients to entice the viewer into what is a powerful ghost storybr br herbert wise did not need blood violence or gore to send chills down the spines of an audience using your own imagination the woman in black is a figure of fear and dread and whose presence is never absent once she first appearsbr br the main character arthur kidd a solicitor learns about his unseen spectre on his mission to settle the estate the widow dies and arthur spends few nights inside her dreary home in which he notices many oddities which may haunt him for some days some of the scenes are very unsettling and claustrophobic particularly the locked room which opens itself which turns the generator off and closes arthur in darkness the film becomes more harrowing the more you put yourself in arthurs shoes and his efforts to shake this ghost off the writer puts many chilling additions into the story an example being the tin soldiers reappearance one is eager to learn the meaning of it all the fact we never really learn that much about the widow leaves more to the imagination and makes it all the more unsettlingbr br the widow for the most part looks vicious and intimidating the scene after winding the generator sent the chills down me a woman who appears out of nowhere on isolated marshy land with a howling wind  having been on such properties myself i can appreciate how isolating this is and the scene in the inn was perhaps the most horrible things ive seen one i dont wish to watch in a hurry or show to elderly relatives i have often woken up at night thinking she was behind me in my sleepbr br the woman in black is a great tv movie and a lost gem i agree to some extent the internet hype for this film has been totally overblown and can see why people were disappointed after spending the best of 50 on it but i think the net has defeated hidden gems because it makes films like these overexposed i think its still brilliant and fantastically acted and i consider it the greatest ghost story of the last century
4,indian directors have it tough they have to compete with movies like laggan where 11 henpeckedcastrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots devdas a hapless fedar festooned foreign return drinking to oblivion with characters running in endless corridors oblivious to any ones feelings or sentimentsalas they live in an ornate squalor of red tapestry and pageantry but to make a good movie you have to tightrope walk to appease the frontbenchers who are the quentessential gapers who are mesmerized with split skirts and dishumdishum fights preferably involving a nitwit bollywood leading actor who is marginally handsome so you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of leonine village head who in own words defending his village this is considered a violent movie or too masculine for a male audience there are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like nana patekar narasimhan nana patekar lets you in his courtyard and watch him beret and mock the politician when his loyal admirers burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him meanwhile his daughter is bathing his grandsonthis is as authentic a scene you can get in rural india nana patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting which is a disappearing breed in hindi films the violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with songdances thrown in for the gawkers without whom movies wont sell a sad but true state of affairs faster this changes better for bollywood all said and done this is one good movie
7,preposterous sequel stretches credibility to a great degree as diabolical sociopath stanley kaldwell returns this time infiltrating the movie production of the novel he wrote for the garden drownings assuming the identity of a second unit director he murderedbr br film pokes gleeful fun at hollywood with a tongueincheek script taking shots at tyrannical directors who sleep with their actresseslooking for a way up the ladderand dislike anyone challenging them for complete spotlight brian krause who i thought was dreadful overacting to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced portrays the loud temperamental director who doesnt like the fact that his second unit director and screenplay writer alisonplayed by dahlia salemseem to be taking over the production andrew moxham is paul parsons who is the brother of a victim from the first film the films dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all its worth nelson again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty with stanley as clever as ever using his brains to commandeer a film production killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work letting no one stand in his waythat is until alison realizes who stanley really is alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subjectwhat motivated stanley to kill why would he do such a thing and what led such a man down this dark path the humor of alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller of course you get the inevitable showdown between alison and stanley with a really ridiculous unbelievable conclusion regarding the killers fatequite a hard pill to swallow unlike the first film which was photographed with sophisticated polish director pochih leong uses unnecessary techniques which are not neededsuch as shooting an all kinds of weird angles slowmotion in a sepia color and several instances which are captured on videoand rather annoy instead of impress this sequel to me just wasnt on target as much as the original with a lot of the humor less effective and more obvious
7,i rented this dvd for two reasons a cast of great actors and the director even though robert altman can be hit or miss in this case it was a big miss altmans attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester after seeing kenneth branagh in a good film like dead again i didnt think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey and i hope it didnt ruin his reputation robert duvall seems to have fallen the way of most onetime oscar winners on a downward spiral that includes acting in eatingmoney films such as this one duvall was once a great actor in excellent films even though his best performance was not tender mercies but the great santini this movie was truly a big waste of time i give it a out of 10
5,here we are two travelers from a distant futuristic world arrive on earth one is on a desperate mission to preserve a life another is an inhuman killing machine determined to eliminate the woman who will give birth to the saviour of an entire racebr br so what could we call this killing machine its almost like hes some kind of destroyer or eradicator sort of like an exterminator or something whats the word im looking for something that terminates things hmmmmbr br anyway the protector who swiftly doffs the white tunic he stole from luke skywalker in favour of local clothing finds the young woman first and impregnates her with a futureborn herotobe the evil uhhhh exterminator kills some rednecks and steals their guns and clothes then attempts to locate the woman by visiting her workplace and asking around by looking menacingly into peoples eyes and repeating her name threateninglybr br then begins a desperate race for survival as the seemingly deathless and unstoppable exterminator pursues the couple across the countryside at some point he may acquire boots and a motorcycle but im not surebr br perhaps in an exciting finale he will attempt to crush them under the wheels of an enormous tanker truck full of acid then the truck will crash they will be saved but no he will then reemerge as strong as ever he will kill the protector and pursue the girl into a meat packing plant where in a terrifying finish he is pushed into a large piece of industrial chopping machinery and destroyed once and for allbr br but maybe im extrapolating too much after all i did stop watching this movie after mr protector magically impregnates sean young by kissing her at a bar then tells her the child will be born in days br br the costumes and effects are great in this movie i loved them the first time i saw them on star trek next generation too sean young does another great turn as an unemotive replicant and career sweathog stephen baldwin is also on board as youngs fat cop boyfriend not sure where he fits into the plot though maybe hes an import from a different james cameron movie
1,after a chance encounter on the train a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of vienna discussing life and love the primary reason to see before sunrise is to watch a young julie delpy deliver her lines as celine this sexy brainy soulful browneyed blond is sort of a cross between brigitte bardot and joni mitchell as they were in their midtwenties risking overstatement celine is practically the ideal woman unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural unpretentious introspective and selflessly loving we can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak for her sincere intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating further her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks english with a french accent that is very endearing br br if there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar ethan hawke as jessie comes off like a vaguely appealing slob sort of a maynard g krebs of the nineties attempting to appear detached and nonchalant he sort of drags himself through certain shots his pants fit poorly his tee shirt is coming untucked his wavy dark hair his most attractive feature needs a good washing and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee nevertheless he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a twoweek train ride around europe so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine his oftcynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic celine although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation when he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence we know he is getting somewhere br br after blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes bars and silly diversions they agree that because they may never see one another again they should make the most of it jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up br br given his boundless luck in the romance department it is especially irksome when jessie as the very definition of a naive jerk foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp he contents himself with a halfbaked plan quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu to reunite at the same spot in half a year when the appointed time comes you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another perhaps even married and pregnant for whatever reason she probably wont show while jesse who ends up working at target or if hes lucky the local library will go back to vienna desperate to see her again only to wind up alonebr br despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion before sunrise is a beautiful movie i highly recommend both it and the sequel before sunset
0,this may very well be the worst movie ill see if i live to be 100 i think a group of firstgraders could have come up with better plot lines as a class project than this im dumber for having watched it and god have mercy on the souls who were paid to produce this filmbr br and after i finally turned it off i actually had the urge to vomitbr br no one had a clue about photography when made this no one had a clue about acting no one had a clue about just about anythingbr br i cant believe fx shows this crap on occasion the only time i had seen it was on one of the starz channels  not even the main one and it was on at about am at that
7,this movie makes a statement about joseph smith what he stood for and what the lds church believes with all the current media coverage of a certain fugitive people have confused the lds church with the flds church and criminal fugitive warren jeffs jeffs is not associated with the lds church yet media groups internationally have asked for comments about jeffs from the lds church jeffs is not mentioned in the movie at all but i think that it is ironic that this movie with all its points about joseph also point away from the fews of the flds church and their leader at this time in the media world this is a movie about joseph smith and a great one at that some of the most obvious differences between jeffs and joseph is portrayed in josephs humanity acceptance and love jeffs views and opinions differ greatly from joseph smith and the lds church and it is seen in this movie jeffs thinks of the negro as devils joseph smith knew they were children of god and gave up his wifes favorite horse to a african american former slave to buy his sons freedom joseph is shown doing housework for his wife emma and is criticized by a member until joseph tells him that a man may lose his wife in the next life if she chooses not to stay with her husband and that doing chores is a way to help and cherish your wife jeffs brought one of his polygamist wives to her knees in front of a class full of students by grabbing her braid and twisting it painfully till she came to her knees lastly joseph participated with law enforcement and sought aid from the government at all times jeffs thumbs his nose at government and flees at all timesbr br i loved this movie and if you dont know much about joseph smith and what the lds church believes then this is the movie to see and if you had confused the lds church with the flds church then you really need to get your act together we are not much different from anyone who believes in jesus christ the sanctity of marriage and the family as well a patriotic to our homeland and country we are all different as well just like you can find different protestants presbyterians methodist baptist and catholics whats important is our message and what we stand for this movie trys to portray that but there is so much of josephs life that cant be covered in a mere hour movie this was a really great show
7,this movie was a mess it had the absolute worst editing i have ever seen it was almost like at the end of a scene the writer wanted to go to commercial and the filmmaker added a second of black screen to fulfill the writers dreambr br under the messy direction and editing there was a glimmer of something good a good idea a compelling spark but somewhere it went wrongbr br the story is about a quasipsychic priest who is trying to solve a string of murders the first thing that is hard to bite into is richard grieco as a priest well the part doesnt call for him to be a good priest and he succeeds rather well the second problem is dennis hopper as the crazy bad guy he always plays the crazy bad guy very ho humbr br oh a thought occured to me that maybe all the jumpy horrible editing and disconnected plot was trying to add a sense of the confusion the character grieco was experiencing and just to prove that it was contrived they rolled the credits backwords not a good sign for any moviebr br 
5,soap opera about a small town married woman kay francis who works at the local newsstand performs as leading lady in her local playhouse but dreams of becoming a star on broadway when a famous actor who is a ham a windbag and a womanizer to boot arrives in town she visits him in his room with dreams of him giving her tips to stardom  he pretends his valet is his manager tricking her into believing she has all it takes but experience to become a big star her husband finds out and punches the guy resulting in the actors unexpected death  which leads to a murder trial and even more unexpected a life prison sentence for hubby next thing you know shes joined a traveling burlesque show in hopes of one day making it to broadway and making enough money to get her mans freedom  all the while her baby is sleeping in a trunkbr br this film has a pretty interesting plot well a bit farfetched perhaps but very melodramatic with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get it  all greatly enhanced by the strong emotional performance given by kay francis  she just makes this film also helping here is the welldone acting by minna gombell in her role as a getting close to forty older lady who works the burlesque and befriends kay worth seeing especially for kay francis fans
4,bette davis brings her full trunk of tics to this miserable flop which is another variation on the hilariously mismatched lovers theme sadly cagney and davis are truly mismatched in acting styles and the mix is not simply unpalatable but distasteful the only distinction in the film comes from eugene pallette who literally phones in his usual part as the debs misunderstood dad jack carsons performance can only be described as an act of mayhem on the audience
7,hopefully the score has changed by now due to my brilliant and stunning review which persuades all of you to go and watch the film thereby creating an instant chorus of 8s this movies true scorebr br as mentioned before chris rock is the king previous to going to see this movie i wasnt that over the top about him but now im banging on the doors of chris rocks website begging him to take me on as his protege this film is truly funny if you dont find this movie funny you really need therapy and its humour which targets all areas of society including racepredictably class division love wealth employment dreams stand up comedy the list goes onbr br there was one slight disappointment for me however this was that in going into this film i didnt realise that it was actually a remake of heaven can wait another quite good movie made in 1971 with warren beatty as such i was quite surprised when i watched this movie and suddenly the plot began to unravel to be distinctly similar to an older movie i had watched on tv a few weeks ago regardless this movie is in my opinion the better version out of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that chris rock is funnier than warren beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of anyyou get the picturebr br well to the actual plot of the filmbr br dont spoil the experience for yourself dont read the plot just go and watch a movie because there have been two reviews on imdb so far that have raved mad about it go see it because it is the funniest thing you would have seen in a long time go and see it because its a cinema experience that doesnt leave you grumbling ad nauseum at the cost of cinema tickets go see it because it is a good movie
4,there are no spoilers here because there is no plot to spoil madchen amick is living proof a face can make a living acting no talent required the only bright spot are a few really good oneliners delivered very nicely by alice krige but then again she is alice krige her soft dreamy voice gives the only hint at just how seductively dangerous these odd creatures can be she is believably creepy in this otherwise unbelievable plot how they got her to agree to this project remains a mystery the screenplay writers must have been medicated when they submitted this script it has major continuity problems superficial stereotypical characters horror formula writing and simply falls short of making any sense whatsoever the creatures while they have neat skills like going dim the question of where they come from and what they are is never so much explored br br dont waste any time on this one
2,a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie its based on a novel of the same title which was equally good though different from the film really made you think about how youd respond if you were in the shoes of the characters recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent spouse or family memberin other words everyonebr br though the production isnt quite hollywood qualityno big special effectsstill the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it and the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes illbr br you dont want to miss this
0,warning spoilers galorebr br tim burton remaking this sui generis movie is about as sensible as remaking psycho  oh thats right some idiot already did that  i rest my casebr br movie opens with chimpnaut blundering a simulation proving hes not that smart from the outset marky mark appears in shot without his characteristic underpants showing then is turned down by a plain woman who prefers the touch of chimpanzeesbr br the perfunctory establishing shot of the space station orbiting saturn for no apparent reason interior of ship abustle with genetic experiments on apes must we travel 1300 million kilometers to saturn to conduct these experiments the special effects team decrees itbr br markys chimp gets lost in that staple of 60s scifi cinema  the time warp marky then demonstrates the space stations mindboggling security ineptness by stealing a pod without anyone noticing while simultaneously demonstrating his abject stupidity in mounting a deepspace rescue mission into a wormhole for an expendable test chimp with a million dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen suppliesbr br before anyone can say pointless remake marky has surfed the wormhole crashed on an alien planet removed his helmet without any thought to the lethality of the atmosphere and is being chased through a sound stage that almost resembles a lush rainforest if it werent for the kliegs backlighting the plastic treesbr br surprise its apes doing the chasing  or at least it would have been a surprise if no one saw planet of the apes thirtythree years agobr br since marky mark did not get to show his pecs take down his pants or bust his lame whiteboy rap he was characterless michael clarke duncans gorilla teeth being inserted crookedly helped immensely in establishing his lack of character helena bonhamcarter aka irritating chimp activist at a loss without a shakespearean script did a fine job of outdoing both marky and clarke as most cardboard cutout paul giamatti the orangutan slave trader secured the role of token comic relief and interspecies klutz though i have grown bilious in hearing puns relating to this movie one review headline captured the essence of this planet of the apes reimagining the apes of roth while everyone else minced about looking like extras from one million years bc or greystoke tim roth as chimpanzee thade chews massive amounts of scenery and hurls kaka splendiferously as entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic thade was his character lacked a behavioral arc thade is mad when we first meet him and hes pretty much at the same level of mad at films end nice twistbr br the original pota 1968 featured a leading character charlton hestons taylor who was so disenchanted with mankind that he left earth for space with no regrets  yet as that film progressed taylor unwittingly found himself locked in a battle to prove mankinds worth  as their sole champion the original film was ultimately a tale of humiliation not salvation when taylor discovers the statue of liberty he is forced to realize that his species had not prevailed is there anything that cerebral or ironic to marky marks leo or roths thade no but theres lots of runningbr br the slogans cry take back the planet but its the apes planet in this movie humans and apes crashlanded here together the humans having degenerated to cavepeople allowing the apes to acquire speech and sensual body armor the apes deserved to inherit the planet along comes marky mark in true anthropocentric arrogance taking it for granted that humans have to be the apex predators simply because theyre there taking it back is as ludicrous as apes landing here in 2001 complaining a planet where men evolved from apes and then causing trouble with their overacting and hairy anusesbr br heston was cast in the 1968 pota because he had established his reputation as a maverick he was benhur michelangelo moses to cast him as the mute dogged animal in an alien society was to stupefy an audiences expectations how crazed must a world be where our man charlton cannot command respect marky mark has currently only established that he has tight underpantsbr br though heston was denigrated constantly by the ape council he dominated the screen with his charisma and stupendous overacting when marky mark tries to instill fervor in the mongoloid humans its like that unpopular guy in school suddenly being made classroom monitor who tells you to stop drawing penises on the blackboard and you throw a shoe at him burton tries to elevate marky to humanitys icon but he comes off as a chittering deviant in the original film the apes deem taylor a deviant yet he was to audience and apes alike an icon of humanity that irony againbr br it was apt that a man who elevated scenechewing to an acting technique  heston  should play the father of this films primo scenechewer thaddeus roth as roths apedad charlton utters his own immortal lines turned against the humans this time damn them damn them all to hellbr br the movie gets dumb and dumber towards the end while thaddeus is giving marky an assbeating lesson a pod descends from on high with markys chimpnaut in it apes demonstrate their hebetude by bowing in obeisance to this incognizant creature while marky proves his own hebetude by muttering lets teach these monkeys about evolution firstly theyre not monkeys you ape secondly it was genetic tampering and imbecilic plot fabrications which brought the apes to this point not evolution and what you intend to teach them by blowing them away with the concealed lasergun is called misanthropy not evolutionbr br giving away the twist ending would only confuse viewers into believing that estella warrens halfnekkid role was actually integral to the plot be still my pantsbr br no matter that he was humankinds last underpanted hope in the end cop apes take marky away to plot point prison where he was last heard ululating its a madhouse a madhouse
2,what makes midnight cowboy into a successful movie is the way in which joe buck becomes bonded to ratso rizzo through a series of hardships that affect them both there really arent many glimpses of hope in this film for either character but the hard realities that beset them both give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each otherbr br this film features jon voights finest performance and probably dustin hoffmans as well the rest of the cast is made up of unknowns though it is rounded out by a fine series of character actors including the cowpoke on the bus at the start of the film also for those interested andy warhols apprentice paul morrissey shows up briefly during the party scenebr br if you havent seen this movie it is essential check it out
5,i have read several good reviews that have defended and critised the various aspects of this film one thing i see over and over is annoyance with megan the idealistic political scientist trying to change the world i loved her character maybe because i am a 23 year old political science student and i think im going to change the world too so i relate to megan besides shes cute shes no super model but more of a cute girl next doorbr br ok so she cried and screamed a lot its very dramatic and seems overdone but doesnt it fit her character she goes on that show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point she thinks people who enjoy such a show are sick i think she made her argument very well of course being a young naive girl she is terrified of what she is about to face i think her acting accurately portrays a young girl showing moral courage despite her overwhelming fear furthermore i think she maintained a certain dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation she was inbr br as for the movie in general other than megan it was pretty much what i expected it had excellent gore scenes by microbudget standards the plot maybe took a quick thought hardly any contemplation its basically just a dark humorist senseless slasher film which the name implies i love the sadism of the doctor he kept ripping megans shirt off not just for the cause of sleaze though largely so but also to torment her before he kills her the chainsaw hick was hilarious for slasher film lovers he was probably the best characterbr br i give this film out of 10 it had a good setting almost no plot and a mix of good and terrible acting i would recommend it for a cheap thrill but hardly a diamond in the rough that is microbudget horror
6,the plot is plausible but banal ie beautiful and neglected wife of wealthy and powerful man has a fling with a psychotic hunk then tries to cover it up as the psycho stalks and blackmails her but what develops from there is stupefyingly illogical despite the resources that are available to the usual couple who has money and influence our privileged hero and heroine appear to have only one domestic their attorney and local police who say they can do nothing at their disposal while they grapple with suspense and terror they have no private security staff only a fancy security system that they mishandle household or grounds staff chauffeurs etc not even apparently the funds to hire private roundtheclock nurses to care for the hero when he suffers lifethreatening injuries leaving man and wife alone and vulnerable in their mansion our heroine is portrayed as having the brains of a doorknob and our hero a tycoon behaves in the most unlikely and irrational manner the production is an insult to viewers who wasted their time with this drivel and a crime for having wasted the talents of veteran actors oliva hussey and don murray what were they thinking and shame on lifetime tv for insulting the intelligence of its audience for this insipid offering
6,i think the majority of the people seem not the get the right idea about the movie at least thats my opinion i am not sure its a movie about drug abuse rather its a movie about the way of thinking of those genius brothers drugs are side effects something marginal again its not a commercial movie that you see every day and if the author wanted that he definitely failed as most people think its one of the many drug related movies i however think something else is the case as in many movies portraying different cultures audience usually fully understands movies portraying their own culture ie something theyve grown up with and are quite familiar with this movie is to show what those genius people very often think and what problems they face the reason why they act like this is because they are bored out of their minds  they have to meet people who do mediocre things and accept those things as if they are launching space shuttles on daily basis they start a fairly hard job and excel in no time they feel like i went to work did nothing still did twice as better as the guys around me when they were all over their projects what should i do now with my free time and whats even more boring when you can start predicting behavior not because youre psychologist but instead because you have seen this pattern in the past so for them from one side its a non challenging job which is also fairly boring sometimes and from another they start to figure out peoples behavior its a recipe for big big boredom and the dumbest things are usually done to get out of this state they guy earlier who mentioned that their biggest problem is that they are trying to figure out life in terms of logic math describes logic while life is not really a logical thing is actually absolutely right
6,you talking to me 1987 is a pretty bad movie starring some dude who i have never seen before or since starring as a guy from the neighborhood who tries to become an actor he has a heavy jones for taxi driver as tries to use that shtick to make it big when he learns the hard facts of life he does what everyone else does changes his image he goes from good fella to a surfs up dude over night his friend cant believe the change but he scores with faith ford and gets a cool paying gig can this young punk keep his street cred whilst making it bigbr br this is a real lame movie that tries too hard to incorporate too many things at once an interesting idea that falls apart due to poor execution who knows maybe somebody will pick up the ball and run because the film makers fumbled the ball this timebr br dont waste your time with this movie unless you want to see a hot faith ford and a young bubba from forest gumpbr br xx
5,i would reccomend this film to everyone not only to the fans of the rocker luciano ligabue but to all filmbuffs because its sincere moving funny and true because ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover and every frame of his film is made with love and care because his characters are loved and ask to be loved because most of the italian debut films are lousy and this one done by an outsider is a real joy to watch and to listen at because stefano accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of andrea pazienza who was like freccia beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin that ligabue shows as it is unglamorous and ugly without indulging in easy moralisms because its a film that speaks to our heart our ears our souls and because i lived the experience of the fm radios and it was exactly like that thanks luciano

7,okay if youve seen the ring youve basically seen the grudge its trying to be scary by just having freaky camera work and loud sounds but it fails miserably the plot if you can call it that is weak and rather full of holes for instance how would the care center have known that yoko didnt show up for work when the people who lived in the house were not there and its not really clear what bill pullmans character had to do with anything he just kind of came out of nowhere to advance the plot it didnt make a lot of sense what happened to the original family who was hanging in the room the little boy or the dad and was yoko alive or dead when the care center guy found her there were too many unanswered questions and i was too bored to think about it more
6,just saw this film and i must say that although there was shown in the beginning some effort to produce a decent film this was absolutely horrible  but not in the sense that was intended im surebr br it was like a child was directing this insult to intelligence with the belief that all wouldbe viewers are morons or extremely hard up for entertainment or both thank god for fast forward i cant imagine the type of viewer the producer had in mind when making this film i mean you have actors trying to be serious albeit barely and a script that cries for a total rewrite i just cant say anymore if harlequin romance decided to do horror films this would be a good effortbr br if you found this movie to be entertaining then i strongly suggest that you seek out some guidance as to the purpose of movies there is much better fare out there join a club read reviews but above all avoid crap like this
3,i have to admit i did not finish this movie because it was so amazingly stupid and not worth watching i watched it with a room full of kids who also were not laughing at the stupid and crude humor the director bob dolman seems to be so obsessed with sphincters and genitalia that it overrides the real story that i grew up with this is not a good film for kids besides the fact that the content is so crude the movie is just stupid has bad flow and has no intelligence behind it what a waste of a perfectly good story if you read the book when you were younger and loved it then dont waste your time watching a movie that so badly botches it that it makes you angry buy your kids the book instead
0,despite the patronage of george lucas this captivating and totally original fantasy in lumage a combination of animation through live action cutouts is about as far removed from the usual kiddie fare as anything made by ralph bakshi in his heyday brilliantly conceived characters such as the shapeshifting dog ralph one of a duo of bumbling rejected heroes synonamess botch the hilariously foulmouthed villain and rod rescueman the pompous novice superhero breathe life into a uniquely clever concept frivoli vs murkwood or the eternal fight between dreams and nightmares in this context the morinfused songs on the soundtrack ought not to have worked but somehow they do its a real pity therefore that i have had to watch this via a truly crappylooking boot culled from a tv screening of the uncensored version  there is also a milder variant that toned down the language for its vhs release  since the film is otherwise unavailable on dvd interestingly both henry selick and david fincher worked on this picture in subordinate capacities
6,i went to the movie as a sneak preview in austria so didnt have an idea what i am going to see the story is very normal the movie is very long  i believe it could have cut to 12 without causing any problems to the story its the type of movie you can see in a boring night which you want to get bored more  ashton kutcher was very good  kevin costner is ok the movie is speaking about the us coast guards how they are trained  their life style and the problems they face as there arent much effects in the movie so if you want to watch it  then no need to waste your money and time going to the cinema would be more effective to watch it at home when it gets on dvds
4,quote by nicolas martin nicmart from houston tx fine film but dvd reformatted for tv april 2002  this is a charming and emotive film on the other hand the dvd i purchased has been reformatted to fit your tv by the clods at columbia tristar there is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format except that hollywood treats all films like the moronic disposable trash that it is so used to producing what a shamebr br what a criminal shame indeed however there is another version out though see here for details httpwwwdvdbeavercomfilmdvdcompare2kingofmaskshtmbr br wonderful performances by the two main actors the king and doggie btw
1,this would be a watchable hollywood mediocre if it had a good editing it relies on the typical american thriller plot  who is going to outsmart everyone acting is below average but with shining appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film and he is mostly responsible if the tension in the film rises film was completely suffocated by blank video and sound shots and most of it looks like raw film material all in all if you dont mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project this is a film to watch i guess that would be enough to say on this film everything else could really spoil the tension that is probably low enough
0,excellent movie a realistic picture of contemporary finland touching and profound one of the best finnish films ever made captures marvelously the everyday life in a central finland small town peoples desires and weaknesses joys and sorrows the bright early fall sunshine creates a cool atmosphere to this lucid examination of people in a welfare society lampela is indeed one of the most promising finnish filmmakers he shows that it is possible to make gripping movies without machine guns and bloodshed his next film eila is also worth seeing although the story of cleaning women fighting for their jobs is not quite as universally appealing as the destinies in joki
2,the sarah silverman program is very similar to sarahs own stand up its so over the top with prejudice that you cant possibly take it to heart the fact is though that while most all people will get it it doesnt mean they will all appreciate it its a very polarizing and one dimensional show so if you dont like it after 10 minutes you may as well give up there if you do like it after 10 minutes stay tuned because every episode thus far has been as good as the lastbr br like all shows though it is not perfect personally i love the program but there are some huge faults with it racist songs are funny but get older a lot faster than silverman seems to realizea problem that i had with jesus is magic as well it seems as if silverman gave herself a quota for songs per episode that doesnt need to exist not to mention that while the lyrics to the songs she writes are good the music well isntbr br another thing to keep in mind is that while this show will for some reason appeal to fans of monty python upright citizens brigade etc it is nothing like those shows i can watch monty python all day but as much as i like this show i cant watch more than the half hour limit at a time it gets flat very fast the repeat value for this show is low toothe second time around an episode is fairly funny and by the third time in my opinion its boringbr br still that first time around is very very funny give it a shot
0,slasherswell if you like horrors its definitely one to see otherwise dont even botherit is completely obvious that this film has an extremely low budget for instance it looks as if the entire film has been shot in a warehouse somewhere and on numerous occasions you will see the mike boom shadow and the camera mans shadow trust me you wont need to look for themalso try to ignore the cheesy actors if thats what you call themthe basic outline is a few people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze due to their being killers on the loose and whoever lives at the end gets rich now there is something about this film that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that with a cheap budget horror these daysfor example when i watched it i thought to my self i wouldnt mind having a go at this game especially for 12000000 so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind
7,spoilers a bit ridicules made for tv movie has sexy and middle age golddigger isabelle collins susan tuccidoing a number on every man she comes in contact with in the movie first winning over their hearts then their wallets and then when their no longer any use to her thrown in the wastepaper basket like a used up kleenex tissuebr br isabelles first victim is non other then her abusive on keeping isabelle from raiding his bank account husband stewart john ohurley its later in the movie when isabelle gets very friendly with former plumber and now yacht salesman richard davis philip casnoff that she without really telling him has the totally lovesick richard get a contract out on her unsuspecting husbands life getting this exconvict in fact as soon as hes released from prison daggett nicholas campbell to do the job on stewart richard soon finds out that he didnt get exactly what he paid 1500000 in cashforbr br getting a little too greedy daggett not only blew stewarts brains out but took a solid gold watch that stewart offered him in order to spear his life as well the watch was easily traced to daggett as he tried to pawn it at a local jewelry shop where he was quickly arrested with doggett spilling his guts out on who hired him to whack stewart it doesnt take long for the long arm of the law to arrest stewarts by hiring doggett killer isabelles husband to be explumber and yacht salesman richard davis davis arrest by the police happens just as he and isabelle took the vows of matrimony in a local churchbr br isabelle manipulates everyone exclusively men that fall head over heels for her to her advantage by getting them to do her dirty work always playing the part of the naive housewife or widow or lover or even client isabelle seems to live a charmed life always one step ahead of the law and police no matter what she does isabelle covers her pretty behind so well that its almost impossible to pin her down on any in having others do them of the many crimes that she commits through a second party in the filmbr br after screwing figuratively as well as literally her first husband steven her second husband for less then ten seconds richard and finally her or richards attorney gavin kendrick kamar de los rey isabelle knows that its only a matter of time before the police get wise to her with the da getting both richard and kendrick to turn evidence against her isabelle now knowing that everything is fast closing in on her makes her final move getting everything in order by transferring all her cash overseas isabelle and her 10 yearold daughter ruby lauren collins shoot down to the passport office in order to get clearance passports to get out of the countrybr br its then when the cagey and clever isabelle makes her first and possibly last and fatal mistake in the movie isabelle is told by the passport clerk don carrier shell have to wait a full 48 hours for her and rubys passport to clear just enough time for the police to find and arrest her outlandish ending that goes against almost everything and every ethic thats in a film noir or crime movie an ending that will not only blow your mind but your concept of whats right and wrong in the world
5,saw this saturday night at the provincetown film festival and its a sticktoyourbones movie  its really stayed with me adapted very smartly from what is probably an excellent novel its a backandforthintime drama with fully rounded characters thoughtful rumination on life choices and im not exaggerating one of the greatest casts ever assembled in 100 years of moviemaking wonderful work from everyone led by a luminous vanessa redgrave as a dying deluded newport matron and claire danes as her much younger self meryl streeps daughter mamie gummer is like mama the real deal patrick wilson looks like paul newman circa 1958 and doesnt overplay the charm and what a pleasure to see such excellent stage actors as barry bostwick and eileen atkins contributing sharp detailed cameos hugh dancy also from the stage doesnt bring much edge to the somewhat clichd role of an unhappy rich wastrel and the family issues are resolved perhaps more neatly than real life would allow but its a deliberately paced visually gorgeous meditation on real life issues and you can cry at it and not feel like youre being recklessly manipulated also what a sumptuous parade of 1940s50s automobiles
1,i came here for a review last night before deciding which tv movie to settle in front of and those i found made this one look unmissable how misled i feelbr br firstly it needs to be pointed out up front that this is very much a housewifes daytime movie the performances are wooden every sentence is an attempt at poignant in the way that housewifes daytime movies and bad soap operas always are and it is based in that predictable and welltrodden premise that men particularly soldiers are essentially violent and incompassionate the whole movie is about the drama apparent in the moments when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimensionbr br if that sounds tolerable or even enjoyable to you then be warned linda hamiltons german accent while quite good is painfully distracting  as is her face for some reason the other performances are no doubt an enduring source of embarrassment to their perpetrators with painfully thin and obvious characterizations being the order of the day there are few surprises but do watch for the monty pythonesque endless supply of food and drink that miraculously appears from the hungry soldiers knapsacksbr br i wasnt expecting action but i had hoped for beautiful or textural or emotionally charged what i got was a particularly bad christmas feelgood story that will have an intelligent audience cringing with the crapulence of it allbr br watch it under the folowing circumstances theres nothing else on you are a fan of predictable housewife takes on men and wins tv movies the only way you can appreciate a true story is when hollywood turns it into a feature film youve imbibed enough nog that your emotions are easily stirred by unsophisticated storytelling
2,my wife and i are semi amused by howie mandels show i also like shatner  even when hes at his most patheticbr br but this is absolutely the worst show on televisionbr br please cancel this show it sucks abr br the only positive thing i can say is that the girls are hotter on this show and seem to wear less clothing than deal or no dealbr br the questions are a mixture of way too easy and incredibly obscure and watching shatner or the contestant say show me the money makes me want to vomitbr br this one will not last
5,this unsung quiet gem tells the true story of a pow escape during ww ii the performances are incredible especially anthony steele the movie works on many different levels cerebral emotional visual and literal the dialogue is ingenious and rings very true in fact an unusual allaround authenticity puts this one headandshoulders above most war epics
0,i really didnt expect much from this film seeing as it has people from parkersburg wv which is were i live acting in it this town is dull and so is this film there were a few decent scened in the movie but i was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they made a point to show this movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there wasnt any unless you are from parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see everyday then stay away from this movie the dialog will put you to sleep the acting will bore you to tears and steven soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this its a predictable movie with no surprises what you see is what you get and that is a 73 minute tour of parkersburg west virginia and belpre ohio without a narrator
6,ossessione is in very bad state but is now undergoing a full restoration at digital film lab in copenhagen the material used is a master positive 2nd generation originally from the print visconti managed to hide from the fascists it has been scanned on the spirit 4k as 2k rgb data then processed using davinci revival restoration software after this the rest is manual labor and we do not anticipate finishing before early spring sometime next year it should be available on dvd and hopefully also released on hd dvd this film is beautiful and we hope the restoration effort will be enjoyed by many generations to come
2,the good earth is a great movie that you dont hear much about anymore there are a lot of big disasters and events but it is also a nonpassionate love story all of this happens in a little over two hours which is short by todays standards the special effects and costumes are very good for the time periodbr br i am surprised that luise rainer received an oscar for such a limiting role she basically only has three emotions submissive hungry and heartbrokenbr br the performances by the asian and asianamerican actors are terrificbr br 
0,the house that dripped blood is the third in a series of seven amicus horror anthologies if the monster club is included as part of the series this would make eight movies although that movie is very different from the othersbr br i look upon the amicus anthologies with great memories as i used to love them when i was in my teens my feelings for them today are just as strongbr br i spent many years trying to track down this movie the synopses of the stories was so appealing that i went as far as paying a substantial amount for it when i eventually found a copy as great as though the movie is i did feel a sense of disappointment when i finally saw it it wasnt quite as good as i was led to believe whilst better than its two predecessors its nowhere near as good as its four successors as i shall demonstratebr br the linking story sees john bennett as a police inspector tracking down a missing person who lives in a mysterious old house his journey begins at the local police station where he learns the stories of previous occupants the linking story later sees him visiting the estate agent who sold the house whilst this linking story seems enticing on paper it is flat and lifeless in practice and easily the weakest of any amicus anthology i couldnt help but get the feeling that john bennett is a poor mans version of donald pleasance or ian hendry i would much rather have seen one of the two aforementioned actors in his role we could have even had both here  one as the police inspector and another as the estate agent they could and i believe would have brought this weak element of the movie to life much betterbr br the movie contains four stories each of which focuses on an inhabitant of the housebr br the first story sees denholm elliott as a writer of crime stories he is absorbed into an exciting story about a strangler even going as far as drawing a sketch to aid his writing soon after he begins seeing visions of his own creation some excellent direction by peter duffell particularly with the choice of camera angles helps to detract from the restrained script elliotts performance is superb as the tormented writer and he also helps to elevate the story the story ends with a semitwist but i couldnt help get the sense of a script which didnt allow it to live up to its potentialbr br the second story sees peter cushing move into the house he is a lonely man who is still pining for a beautiful young woman who once jilted him and who he keeps a picture of cushings performance really brings this emotionallymoving story to life he is helped by the director who chooses to include continual focus on cushings loneliness this is taken further with a great hallucination scene that helps us to see inside cushings mind anyway cushing sees a figure at a nearby wax museum that looks just like his girl naturally his obsession grows but this seemingly romantic story has a disturbing twist at the end joss ackland plays cushings rival but his performance is massively overshadowed by the late great peter cushingbr br the third story and easily the best sees christopher lee  my favourite horror actor of all time  move into the house with his daughter mr lee gives one his perfect ice cold performances here he shows no love or attention for his daughter at all he even brings in a school governess to educate her the governess played by nyree dawn porter in another of her superb performances tries to find out what is wrong without giving too much away i can reveal that witchcraft plays a role christopher lees presence is truly electrifying in every scene hes in chloe franks deserves special recognition for her massively underrated performance as the little girl who is easily the creepiest character in the whole movie the movie is worth seeing even for the sake of seeing just this one storybr br the final story is played almost entirely for laughs but it certainly does entertain and thats what matters jon pertwee plays a horror movie actor who moves into the house he is very dissatisfied at the approach his producers take to movies seeing everything as cheap and fake particularly the costumes so he decides to buy an authentic cloak for his latest vampire role geoffrey bayldon has an excellent cameo as a dealer who sells pertwee an ancient cloak when pertwee puts the cloak on he starts developing fangs and basically transforming into a vampire pertwees performance has to be seen to be believed it truly is hilarious ingrid pitt is also in this story but her talent is wasted in a role that should have been much largerbr br the linking story finishes with a loose connection to the final story this is particularly fitting since the inspector was looking for pertwee and naturally decides to visit the house the rest youll be able to work out for yourself as weak as the linking story is it does have a decent if somewhat unintentionally comical endingbr br im convinced that the blame for the shortcomings in what should have been a truly magnificent movie doesnt lie with peter duffell the director who really does his best with what hes got i think the script was just too restrained and lacking the ambition that can be found in the four later moviesbr br overall the house that dripped blood despite its flaws is a mustsee for fans of the amicus anthologies fans of other amicus movies or fans of portmanteau horror movies if my summary provides the movie with enough appeal in your eyes check it out youll enjoy it
5,magicians is a wonderful ride from start to finish thanks in large part to the magic that is generated by the stars alan arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles in decades like any really fine film its a journey in which the theme is redemption and the results of dreaming i cant believe this film is so difficult to find  id buy it on dvd in a heartbeat but have yet to find an outlet
0,this show has all the typical characters in a comedy the good guy the idiot the pervert the rich girl but its set on the 70s thats the only difference that it has with other tv comedies i dont know how you can like this show its humor is pathetic i mean the jokes are so direct a typical dialog is this fez oh jackie i want to have sex with you audience laughs jackie fez youre a pervert audience laughs fez oh yes i am audience cheers and applauds this isnt funny i think that if it didnt have those laughs i dont know how you call that in english sorry you wouldnt laugh at all this isnt intelligent comedy this is an insult to the public i like most of the american comedies but this isnt good at all i would give it out of 10 sorry for my poor english again
3,first i want to clarify that the average users inability to appreciate imagination is appalling what makes this show so unique is the hyperreality it creates you dont need to know why ned can bring people back from the dead or why it can only be for a minute where has the wonderment of childhood whimsical tales gone much like a wrinkle in timebr br i say it is refreshingly original because it is a polar opposite to the masses of layitallout television that leaves no room for imagination or wonderbr br its nice to add a bit of escapism to the television experiencebr br the hyperreality is my favorite aspect of the show the 1950sesque setting the innocent and rare characters and the scenery and physical setting which are not meant to be taken as pure realitybr br this show masks the morbid nature of death while others embrace it while entertaining other television shows have taken a back shelf to this series it truly has restored a sense of curiosity imagination and wonder to televisionbr br pushing daisies quickly made it to the top of my list
1,when a small glob of space age silly putty lands on earth it soon begins consuming earthlings and putting on weight the only part of this senseless drivel that i enjoyed was all the cool classic cars this dog had so many holes it could be sliced and sold for swiss cheese this thing actually made 20 million bucks and mcqueens salary was 3k all were vastly overpaid the monster looked a lot like a large beanbag and the teens looked as though they could have children approaching their teenage years and those blasts from the shotgun sounded like a pellet rifle with a sound suppressor the ending was pitifully trite obviously the producers were leaving the door open for a sequeland there were many thumbs down
5,well this might be one of the funniest movies of all time and sandy gives a tourdeforce performance alas her career never quite took off but  at last  she will always be remembered for her three firstrate pictures the king of comedy dallas doll and without you im nothing she dons into different personas from new york socialite to diana ross to create a biting and hilarious critique of popular culture in america sexy and fierce tender and sensual philosophical and melancholic she convinces the audience in every scene and she actually is really pretty watch this one if youre not from iowa youll certainly enjoy it
6,this is a great small film i say small because it doesnt have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions as in a john woo film great performances by roy scheider and the three bad guys john frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days the film is very easy to watch the story is more of a yarn than a washing machineinstead of everything going around and around it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens wonderful ending very positive i never read the elmore leonard book but it cant be much different from the film because it feels like im watching an elmore leonard movie
7,i lost my father at a very young ageso young in factthat i have no recollection of himover the years i have learned many things about him one of those things was that he loved westernsand watching bonanza every sunday evening was an absolute ritual for himimyself remember the tail end of the series runhaving been years old when the show ceased production in 1973watching this show over the years somehow makes me closer to my long ago lost fatherit has all the right elements to make a show successfullaughtertearsedge of your seat suspenseand it even angered you at timesmy most vivid memory of the shows original runcame shortly after the death of our beloved hoss cartwrightdan blockerone particular episodeand the end of the closing credits flashed a picture of blockerand faded to blackand i can also recall my oldest sister with a tear in her eye at the sight of thisi can remember this as though it were yesterdayon behalf of my late father who is not here to say so himselfwe love bonanzalong live the cartwrights
2,i saw this movie back in 1984 we first started watching this is spinal tap and after minutes we were ready to fall asleep so we went instead to see this movie if you have any conspiracy theorys going around in your head you will want to watch this one br br the question you have to ask yourself when watching this movie are do you think the government would be capable of doing this in my opinion there is no doubt that they could br br but i dont want to give out too much information as that would be a spoiler and i think that you should view the movie for yourselfbr br but just to let you know we still talk about this movie 20 years later and trying to explain it to people is not the easiest thing in the world to do
4,hearing about how hilarious this movie is i finally rent it atbr br the video store and for 75 minutes maybe i laughed times thisbr br movie a collection of skits that make fun of television is anbr br incoherrent mess the jokes fall flat the humor deals withbr br issues from the 1970s that just arent relevant anymore andbr br the jokes go on way too long almost like the new snl skits thebr br past few years yeah chevy chase is in this but maybe of allbr br about or minutes i liked the fact that this was verybr br raunchy and had nudity galore but couldnt it be funny dobr br yourself a favor and rent kentucky fried movie which is a farbr br superior film made in the
0,i have to admit that this reimagining of the original 1968 film was a huge disappointment specially when taken into consideration that this is a tim burton film he is defenetly one of the most original and might i say cool directors hollywood has producedbr br i am personally a great fan of his work but something obviously went wrong with his latest flick the planet of the apes i really enjoyed the original film when it first came out people expected just another cheezie 70s science fiction film but a very surprise anding totally proved that theory wrong it had indeed a clear cut message an obvious antiwar message fear of the cold war where it was taking the world and fear of the use of nuclear weapons played a big role in the mind of the filmmakers those reasons made the film rise above all expectations and it became a instant classic although the new film the remaking or whatever leaves us with nothing no message no ideals behind it it is just another moneyminded summer blockbusterbr br visually tim burton does not let you down the dark and creepy settings were excellent and of course the make up was terrificbr br obviously that is not enough to keep people intrested in a film there has to be an exciting plot or storyline in this movie the plot is highly uninteresting and it is extremely badly thought out the script is very lame and it is full of gaps it looks like this film had been written in a big hurry the explanation for why the apes where there and why the ruled the planet was indeed very stupid and proved the scriptwriters ignorancebr br it raised a lot of questions which had no reasonable answers tobr br for example why did the apes speak english why were there other apespecies than chimps on the planet given that there were only chimps in the space ship that crashlanded on the planet where the hell did all of those humans come from how were a few chimps able to evolve into a huge raise of all kinds of monkeys in only a few thousands years i mean it took a few million years for us to evolve from monkey to manbr br and finally the bad surprise ending was just plane dumb it was probably just thrown in because the original film had such an end then they felt that the audience were expecting the same kind of ending the ending also raises a lot of questions which i know dont have intelligent answears did theid learn to work the space ship which was powerless and learnt to fly back in time and take over the earth single hand and what did he do breed with all the women and lets say that that would happen i higly doubt that history would stay the same like washington would be built exactly like it is today i mean woulnt there be a huge banana instead of the memorialbr br well just to say something posative about the film some of the cast was great helen bonham carters character was interesting and wellacted as for tim roth as theid he was very good a little exaturated at some points of the film michael clark duncan was also fine i was not happy with marc whalberg he is not much of an actor and plays here a very macho colourless character very unbielevable and is nothing compared to hestons character in the original and the main female character had no reason or place in the film she was just casted for the looks hardly said a word throughout the entire filmbr br well i think that in the future when people think about the planet of the apes they will think about the original one the latest will soon be forgotten
7,this movie describes the life of somebody who grew up in the worst of circumstances but unlike many people he actually grew up to be a respectable person whats more is that this is a true storybr br antwone fisher is so innocent and yet he was abused such just because he was not white antwone fisher has been married to the same women for ten years and he never fooled around with women coke cigars weed alcohol or any of those things that are very popular in the places he was growing up br br there is not much more to say about this movie it is excellent the only rating i can give it is a 1010
7,once in a while you get amazed over how bad a film can be and how in the world anybody could raise money to make this kind of crap there is absolutely no talent included in this film  from a crappy script to a crappy story to crappy acting amazing
4,there is no suspense in this serial when one episode ends the acting is so shoddy the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing on your mind is how batman and robin will save the day no in fact the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode this show is so boring that i cant see how it ever got made let alone released on dvd obviously the effects are not up to par with contemporary batman films but even the script is awful an incoherent babbling mess about some evil professor and a ray gun or something like that i am not quite sure because it is too awful to follow watch the 60s version or the 90s versions or even batman begins just anything over this version
4,when childhood memory tells you this was a scary movie its touch and go whether you should revisit it anyway i remembered a scary scene involving a homeless person and a cool villain played by jeff koberbr br the first power is not a very good movie sad to say its chock full of those cop clichs and a very poor script with holes a truck could drive through along with countless convenient twists that help the story run along lou diamond phillips is the overconfident bad ass cop who sends baddie serial killer kober to the gas chamber only to find out he was a minion of satan himself and now has the power of resurrection along with the power of possessing every weak minded person who he comes across through in the mix a very poorly realized psychic who helps with the casebr br ahhh this is trash but enjoyable as such especially if you have fond memories of it it scared me as a kid and that scene with the homeless person is still pretty good as for any kind of logic here forget it just about every scenario is thrown in for good measure and you end up with a cross between a steven segal action flick and a 70s demonic flick and who on earth thought it was a good idea to cast lou diamond phillips in the lead here needless to say hes not convincing at all but he tries his best and ive never had the problem with the guy so many reviewers here seem to have as for tracy griffith as the psychic the less said the better but kober is pretty good as the killer always liked that actorbr br the first power may be just what the doctor ordered after a hard days work and a brain switchoff is needed beer will most likely enhance the viewing experience and ill definitely have loads of it the next time i give this movie a spin all in all not a good flick but a somewhat guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who were easily scared as kids see you around buddy boy
3,for months ive been hearing about this little movie and now ive seen it i find it cute cute how so many fledgling directors make movies where they combine other peoples creative ideas in order to make their own onejoke premise of a movie troops swingblade any of the million blair witch parodies come to mind if all that these directors want is a foot inside hollywoods door then theyre doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how hollywood makes films how many times have you heard the phrase its animal house meets back to the future its wall street meets dead poets society or shakespeare in love meets star wars i remember when independent films meant original and daring not safe and predictable
3,considering that this movie had a serious and quite successful launching campaign i would have expected something to be worth the fuzzfrom the opening scene on in which the two brothers sensually caress each other laying naked in a bed it goes rapidly downwardsnothing to get the attention not a mindcatching thing in the whole plot baaad baad acting a few minor exceptions but artificiality is at its best incest and lesbianism are promising themes but the script analyses none of the two in depth  mind that a possible excuse of the makers saying that they aimed for a subtle movie would be hilarious unless subtle and superficial mean the same thing the too curious viewers will not get any interesting sceneat this point that could have saved some of the movieso you can imagine how bad it is many other things could be saidbut please watch the movie yourselvesi am an egoist and i would like as many people as possible to waste about 12h of their liveslike i did

7,first of all the release date is 2009 not 2007 for this feature length nature documentary film it should be more properly referred to as earth 2009 secondly allow me to address the complaints of some reviewers who have seen the planet earth tv series of 2006 br br i have not seen this tv series but learned here that this film is the full length version of this 2006 tv series i judge any film on its own merits not by its source i judge the results on their own and the results of earth 2009 are indeed excellent i dismiss this trivial complaint of some reviewers that its simply an expanded version of the 2006 tv series planet earth so what it doesnt really matterbr br as a film buff and one who has viewed dozens of nature documentaries in my lifetime i was astonished and highly impressed by earth 2009 this is the debut film from the new disneynature division of disney and follows in the footsteps of walt disneys pioneering and academy award winning nature documentary films of the 1950s and 1960sbr br cinematography film editing music score sound and narration are all excellent there have been a few other nature documentaries that also excelled in these categories what really sets earth 2009 apart is its scope it literally covers the entire planet covering all seven continentsbr br after my first viewing it was obvious this documentary film required a massive effort and amount of time and talent to create br br three production companies were required to make this amazing documentary filmbr br earth 2009 convincingly tells the stories of four species on their great migrations as it spans one year through the seasons beginning in january and ending in december from the north pole to the south polebr br two special new hightech cameras were used for this film one camera has a 360 degree computer controlled motorized rotating lens and the other is a hd camera set to an amazing 1000 frames per second this filming technique really added drama and beauty to some of the scenes of earth 2009 especially the cheetah chase and great white sharks leaping out of the water to catch sea lions and an aerial view going over the edge of the worlds highest waterfall there are many stunningly beautiful shots in this documentarybr br via cinematography music score and narration there is drama sadness humor and great beauty in this documentary with a great music score performed by the world renowned berliner philharmoniker excellent creative and technical cinematography and james earl jones narration i consider earth 2009 as the greatest nature feature length documentary film ever madebr br five years of hard work patience talent and dedication really paid off very well here this film should be required viewing in all schools throughout the world i predict an academy award for best documentary feature among other awards truly an amazing astonishing exhilarating and magnificent documentary filmbr br very highly recommended
2,i watched this movie last week sometime and had the biggest laugh ive had in a long while the plot of the film is pretty dumb and convoluted in a badly crafted way the only plus to be found anywhere in the film are corey saviers impressive abs alexandra paul i think thats her name is horrendous as the preachers wife who has a history of depression ted mckenzie is gross and his characters a twit on top of it all and as if the fact that you think shes having sex with her son isnt enough they throw in needless sax solos at every opportunity the end and climax of this film is absolutely abysmal and also laughable i mean who the hell wants to carry the child of a con who tried to make you think he was your son and that you were having an incestuous relationship with him
1,if there was a stars rating i would gladly hand it out to this absolutely horrid pile of waste the fact that the actual summary is perfectly fine and that if it had been made different it could have been brilliant only makes it worse the basic task of locking up a group of people in an experiment chamber is fine but wheres the experiment all i see is a bunch of unintelligent surfers and blondes chatting about music and culture i dont know or want to know about the challenges are pathetic and silly the whole point of reality tv is to show reality if you set a challenge dont make them play with exaggerated props of food and stereotypical cultural elements in friday night games make them do an actual challenge and as for earning prize money thats fine if they actually earnt it these people are nuts if only they would make the show better the actual idea would be glorious but that aint gonna happen
0,goodnight mister tom begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of england where the sun always seems to shine before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of world war ii soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from london and when shy little william is billeted with reluctant gruff old tom who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold our tale beginsbr br and what a load of sentimental claptrap it is in fact its just the old oddcouple buddy formula arent any new stories being writtenbr br as i suggested theres hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in london apart from the odd old ambulance rattling around and certainly no hint of the horror of the blitz as londons citizens file politely into airraid shelters even when the local schoolteachers husband is declared missing presumed killed he is later restored to lifebr br i found goodnight mister tom cliched and obvious and john thaws accent conjured up a picture of ronnie barker of the two ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing his country bumpkin accentbr br incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that i disliked it and looking at fellowimdb reviewers i seem to be in a minority of onebr br 
2,the symbolic use of objects form editing the position of characters in the scene these were all used with such joyous abandon by hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had the way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger while these may seem a bit obvious by todays standards in the silent era they spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken even the title has a least four meanings that i can see the boxing ring the wedding ring the bracelet the lover buys and the love triangle at the heart of the story
7,sogo ishii can be a skilled filmmaker under the right conditions but gojoe tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival a scion of the genji clan the filmmaking has the main hallmarks of a lowbudget production including blurry fight scenes and clumsy montages the kind you might find in an underproduced dorama the monk benkei informs his spiritual teacher that his destiny lies in defeating the mysterious spirit that guards gojoe bridge at night but he doesnt realize that this decision will bring him squarely into conflict with nearly every element of society at that time  but which could earn him enlightenment br br theres no absence of ambitiousness however in its depiction of the conflict between the holy and the worldly artsy flourishes in some of the photography and editing help to compensate for the loose filmmaking style br br a disappointment
5,normally the best way to annoy me in a film is to include some reference to orson welles but here is a scifi comedy quoting the war of the worlds broadcast and it is gold the very concept of a small bunch of diminutiveaggressive and stupid aliens being mistaken as kids in halloween dress is magnificent dont be fooled by the notion that because it seems like a kids movie it is unsophisticated  it isnt theres a lot of hidden treasure a gem
1,if you are the sort of person looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and believable plot then this film is not for you nopeyoull hate it however for those who like sweet slightly screwball comedies then youll have a nice time watching this slight filmbr br tony randall works for the irs and he investigates a very nice farmer who never realized he needed to file an income tax return however hard he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit everyone in the family is thrilled to have company they dote on him and treat him like one of the familyand have plans on getting him hitched to their daughter debbie reynolds thats really about all the plot there is but the film gets high marks for a fun script and decent acting a really nice little curio from the late 1950s
1,cuba gooding jr is a secret service agent who blames himself over the assassination of the us president ill point out straight away that this is not the type of role that this very talented actor is noted for and this film shows us why he teams up with a persistent news reporter angie harmon to uncover the conspiracy surrounding the presidents death and so on blah blah blahbr br even with a cast of james woods cuba gooding jr anne archer and angie harmon end game fails to grab your attention plain and simple some of the action is good the acting isnt all bad and the story although clichd and done before could have lead to an entertaining and enjoyable movie  well it doesnt the writing of the script and the direction makes absolutely sure of that at no point does it suck you into the story or make you give the slightest thought to any of the charactersbr br 410 its boring predictable and dull
5,warning  no plot spoilers ahead but movie spoilers nonetheless my significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an allstar cast wow  very very wrong this movie is an overdone overwrought and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film 15 years after it was shot the copyright date on the box said 2005 yet during the very first flashback sequence i was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early 1960s and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late 80searly 90s dresses and hairdos it looked as if it had been shot a good 15 or 20 years before the rest of the film i tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback and therefore supposed to look old but it looked wwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy more 80s than 60s or even 21st century trying to be 60s then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences yet its a different much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks i was completely confused until i saw in the special features the short film included  it was all the flashback sequences shot in 1990 as a complete student film of the same title as this movie it also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up and indeed acting the coworker in the 2005 scenes thus this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old recut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time the shell story shot in 2005 is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead something about a promise made by the dying man in the early 60s to his girl that they would meet on the fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium  an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in 2005 these new scenes and plot might have been ok except the awful overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clichd action that permeates the new movie dont bother theres a reason why youve never heard of this movie even though it has a wellknown cast  its terrible
4,as i work at a video store i found it to be my solemn duty to talk about the worst movies ive ever seen and warn my friends and coworkers of it amidst one day of particularly heated debate of what is the worst movie my friend dared me to watch btk killer even stating that if i could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice was the worst movie ever then hed watch it i lost i believe that even i made better videos than this in high school and those were hardly great feats of a young genius this film not only lacked in what seemed to be production value it looks like it was shot on a bad camcorder although it is surprisingly clear but also in acting wooden hollow and pathetic dont scratch the surface as well as just generally bad movie feeling i can remember a scene where i heard glass smash suddenly i was reminded of some bad high school plays i know that i reference high school too often here but this film did seem very juvenile both in terms of the set which seemed far too fake but also as if the people were reading their lines from the script not entirely sure what was actually going on my review doesnt do this film justice because i cant describe how utterly horrid the time i spent watching this was its almost ironic that i do a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a movie
1,much has been written about purple rain the apparent quinessential musician bio movie however im here to tell you that the movie does not deserve its high praisebr br first of all lets get one thing straight prince is a great musician and music is the one area where purple rain excels even the score is mesmerising and if this was shot purely as a concert film it would be a great experience unfortunately its not and as such the movie has some problemsbr br first of all is the horrendous actingwriting princes character the kid is supposed to come off as some type of mysterious loner of few words unfortunately this just comes off as corny and incensere a good loner character should at least have some talkative moments unfortunately princes character rarely has over a few words of dialog in the film and its hard to believe that hed get the girl this way everything just seems a little off here which is a shame because you can tell this is a character thats terribly conflicted and lives a very complicated live but we arent ever allowed to get inside of itbr br a surprising aspect of this film is just how much of this takes place in concert prince and morriss lives seemingly take a back seat to the performances here which i guess makes sense from a business perspective but its exhausting to have a hour movie where seemingly half of it takes place on stage especially when the characters back stories get pushed aside for itbr br so to sum it up this isnt a very good movie
5,yeah the archetype of a simple but inspirational movie the very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands gives me a chill whenever i see it thats just brilliant joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life the way he interacts with danny glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is funny and exhilarating a very nice family movie with  i concede  a rather corny happy end but hey it doesnt really matter the movie retains its basic quality by the good acting and the inspirational themes
7,perhaps the worst thing about carlos mencias comedy is that every joke needs to be followed with an insult at the people in the crowd that arent laughing if theres anybody whos insecure its a comedian who wont shut up about his audiencebr br then again perhaps the worst thing about carlos mencias comedy is that he doesnt get off his free speech high horse if you want to be funny just make a joke dont explain all the reasons why youre saving the american way with your failed attempts at generating laughterbr br hmm actually the worst thing about carlos mencias comedy is that it substitues meanspirited jabs at ethnicities for legitimate humor avoid this like the plague
5,after watching the rather sloppy ww1 spy thriller madam lili 1969starring julie andrews on tv this afternoon i suddenly thought i had seen a far superior ww1 spy thriller all i could remember was that it was produced by dino de laurentis it only took a short search on imdb to find fraulein doktor once i recognised the title the memories came flooding back it is for its time a reasonably well crafted story revolving around true events such as the death of kitchener and the german offensives of 1918it also has a female spy who is much more believable than julie andrews as with other reviewers the first and strongest memory was of the well produced battle scenes and of men and horses in gas masks if you have an interest in war films and particularly ww1 it is a film well worth seeing if you have the opportunity
1,i always enjoy this movie when it shows up on tvbr br the one scene that always stands out for me that is is the one with the myrna loy and the painters foreman where she gives him very explicit instructions on the colours and as soon as she goes away he turns the his guys and says did you get that thats yellow blue green and white
7,i avoided watching this film for the longest time long before it was even released i had dismissed it as an overhyped overblown overly romanticized piece of hollywood schmaltz and i wanted nothing to do with it i never watched it in the theatre i shook my head in disbelief at the 11 academy awards  even though i had never seen it then i was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest one of the girls spoke about this movie it was so great she said you really felt like you were on the ship nonsense i thought i shared my feelings with my fellow judges one looked at me and said you might be right but if she liked the movie that much maybe shell want to learn more about the real titanic the movie must have done something right to get her so interested well maybe thought i then it finally appeared on pay tv ok i thought ill give it a look see i didnt want to like it  and i didnt i loved it what a great moviebr br where to start first  the directing my high school public speaking contestant was right james cameron does a superb job of creating an almost you are there type of atmosphere the gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world the nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads then the rising sense of panic you dont just watch it you really do feel it then  the performances the lead performances from kate winslet as rose and leonardo dicaprio as jack are excellent  winslets being the superior i thought but both were good they had their rich girlpoor boy characters down to a perfect t i thought in my opinion though stealing the show was frances fisher as roses mother she was perfect as the snobby aristocrat and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at jack then  the details im no expert on the sinking of the titanic but i have a reasonable general knowledge and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance very impressive indeed then  the song who can watch this movie and not be taken with celine dions performance of my heart goes onbr br problems well the romance was perhaps too contrived in the sense that i just dont accept that jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class i know he was invited the first time but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until hes been there for a while the realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed i thought when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats br br a minor quibble though this is truly an excellent movie my only regret is not seeing it in the theatre where i think it would have been so much more impressivebr br 910
7,i was looking over our dvd tower last night for something to watch we were between netflix mailings and it was a quiet saturday night i pulled one out that i never heard of before and realized it was borrowed from a friend from the jacket it sounded like a ripoff of the big chill but with the allstar cast felt it might be worth watching boy was i wrong not only was it like the big chill it was a ripoff almost character by character the bill paxton character was a copy of william hurt where have you been all this time role spoiler warning and lo and behold he remains behind to take care of the old placecabincamp kimberly williams  meg tilly jerk womanizer matt craven  jeff goldblum etc etc i found myself wondering why im even watching these people there was insufficient character development for me to find any interest in them how did unca lou even find these characters after 20 years plus it wasnt even funny except when perkins fell err flopped out of bed the first morning it was a sign and i missed it after it was over i asked my wife were there any endearing characters in this film  are you sleeping over there she replied no im still thinkingno none i can think of
1,eight simple rules started as a very entertaining series i love john ritter and his character paul hennessey and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the showbr br i have always preferred kerry to bridget bridget has been done before kerry is quite unique and i can relate to her in many ways although im not sure i like the direction her character went in later seriesbr br early episodes were fun good simple teenage plots about paul and cate disciplining the kids however i think the show lost its sparkle when john ritter died i admired the cast and crew for wishing to continue the series but when he died i felt the programme did to to me the whole point of the show was based around the guide of the simple rules of dating my teenage daughter it was written by a real man with teenage daughters and the relevance and the angle of the show had changed without the hennessey dadbr br bridget seemed to get more annoying rory stayed the same and cate was always giving her offspring lifes lessons which before seemed funnier when it was all left to paul i think the granddad is funny especially when hes watching great escape but feel cj is unnecessary to the show he is funny in parts but i felt the story lines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other american comedy series over all the newer ones arent bad just missing excitement and does anyone else find it irritating that cate works at the school and cj and granddads always there too i would always recommend this show to friends as it was very strong at the beginning and well worth watching for paul and kerry but later ones were about average at best
6,i saw this film on television years ago but here several years after i wake up in the morning and still remember her facebr br this film is the most profoundly terrifying film i have seen
7,with the massive advertising this is getting on nickelodeon and nick jr and that ilk my son was bugging us to see it between dvd and the theaters ive seen pretty much everything by now from the outstanding incredibles shrek to the really bad walle brother bear but this was easily the worst movie ive ever seen kids or no kids it was a when it this stupid thing going to end kind of experience ok its aimed at toddlers or it better be  its insulting to the intelligence of anyone over but ive never seen something so predictable repetitive and slowmoving then once youre finally fed up but relieved that the movie is over there is this bizarre thing at the end that you think is the setup for a joke but there isnt one  its serious though its hard to tell what theyre trying to accomplish the 3d effects yeah if youve never seen a viewmaster theyre a big deal otherwise no if you look at the screen without glasses it appears to be the same process even my son was bored by the end both my wife and i looked at each other and said wow at the end bad in every respect
0,contrary to some peoples summaries the women depicted in the film are not geisha they are oiran prostitutes living outside the most famous pleasure districts and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a great number of tokugawa era women i cant say the stories were particularly enlightening but their charm lies in just how typical they are the themes are universal and everyday love friendship and sacrificebr br i did greatly enjoy the art direction and the acting i felt like i was getting a glimpse of a time and place i can never otherwise glimpse the actors especially the women who played the main oiran were a thrill to watch id only recommend this movie to people who want a taste of japanese culture or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories its a great example of both
1,a community pool in connecticut is the setting for this under the radar film which is charming funny entertaining and appealing although it won prizes in major film festivals the big bad swim was not released to hordes of theaters across america but was distributed in dvd form and shown in theaters selectively br br it is unfortunate that the big bad swim never had the marketing hype of a hollywood release considering how many sinkers hollywood has released this year such as i know who killed me the big bad swim a genuinely good independent film has had to swim upstream on its ownbr br nevertheless in the big bad swim actress paget brewster is endearing and believable as amy the wiredtobreaking point math teacher who not only is being dumped by her husband but also is about to lose her job and ends up taking a gamble on a new life tv soap actor jeff branson who is hot plays noah the earnest vulnerable swim teacher who goes the extra pool length to help his students overcome their fears and discovers he can learn from his students pretty sexy jess weixler did i just see her in a bank commercial deftly plays jordan the swimmertobe who works two jobs one as a pole dancer the other as a blackjack dealer her character provides the catalyst for change amongst the ensemble but is the least understandable of the characters because of a lack of a back story or motivation as to why she does what she does jordan is young enough to still live at home with a ubiquitous videocameratoting younger brother who spies on her however her parents are not shown to be involved with her life in any way which seems odd theres no drunken mother or abusive father here to explain why a normal attractive girl from a connecticut suburb would choose to be a selfmedicating pole dancer who debases herself for loutish bachelor parties br br despite this quibble the big bad swim succeeds in large part because it is a happy feel good filmbr br as one might expect learning to swim is the metaphor for life ultimately its better to jump in with both feet and get in the swim rather than sit on the deck because life happens to you anywaybr br the big bad swim is a great date movie a great dorm movie a great what havent i seen movie and men like it as well as women
6,the story line has been rehashed a number of times a breath of life in the retirement home several plays movies novels short stories poems and news articles have beat the subject to no end but its still an excellent platform for character studiesbr br if gideon was crafted more enthusiastically it could be brilliant but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is absolutely flooded with cliches even the subtitle and summary of gideons simple wisdom almost made me laugh in its ineffectiveness mostly indifferent acting is the final straw for this weak film but the rest of it is bland enough to make the actors lack of focus almost irrelevant
5,often laugh out loud sometimes sad story of working divorced guys  lemmon a neurotic clean house husband and matthau a slob sportswriter  who decide to live together to cut down on expenses br br nicely photographed and directed the script is very barbed  that is theres always more than one side to almost every line particularly funny scene involves british sisters evans and shelley who seem amused by everything anyone says but when lemmon busts out his photos of kids and yes exwifetobe he has the girls sobbing along with him before matthau can show up with the promised drinksbr br very entertaining
0,i wont add to the plot reviews its not very goodbr br very improbable orphanage on balabr br cushing and lee at their heightbr br some nice scenerybr br good for face spotting and i quote look at the mouth that is cassie from fools and horsesbr br otherwise a poor example of the british film industrybr br fulton mackay was far better in fraggle rock keith barron was better in anything else and diana dors did what she did bestbr br redeeming feature it was free to watch on the horror channel prior to its going over to subscription i wont be subscribing on this effort
6,camp blood iii is a vast improvement on camp blood ii as it has sound mostly in the right places and a rudimentary plot this time theyve ventured slightly further away from the car park the other two movies were filmed in which is a good move as you can no longer hear cars driving past what is supposed to be a remote wildernessbr br this time around theres a reality tv show and a fake clown to scare off the contestants this is hardly a new idea ive seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same premise where the real killer turns up but at least this one has a plot instead of people just randomly being stabbed with a knifebr br unlike the other two in the series this one is at least good for a few laughs i liked how theres a gunshot sound effect when someone gets stabbed early on and the way the boom mike hovers behind people like a phantombr br i dont know why anyone would want to make a third camp blood film i would have thought it would be better to start from scratch but they have at least tried with this one the half naked deformed woman was a bit much for me it looks like they tried to keep continuity by hiring some freak who would get her clothes off for just like they did in the second movie they still havent worked out that a machete is used for cutting not stabbing but oh well its a camp blood movie what do you expect if you like crap films youll get some fun out of this one
4,an utterly beautiful film one of a handful of i saw when young that entranced me then and still do in thiefs case the impression actually seems to get better with the passing of time by the 90s my daughter and i had seen it many times on tv but still went to the pictures when it came to the local arthouse cinema  when it had finished we came out starry eyed with heads full of poetry and miklos rozsas stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was againbr br idealistic prince ahmad wants to slum it amongst his people for a while to check things out but evil vizier jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne after escaping with a little thief played by sabu ahmad spots a princess and they fall blindingly in love  along the way they have many adventures although apparently not enough for sabu and love not only conquers but annihilates everything the special effects must have been mesmerising in 1940 but time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action  but they still hold up well compared against films like superman from 40 years later anyway if im requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies flying horses and carpets i also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects favourite bits the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when ahmad reveals himself and adelaide halls suitably romantic song the stunning colours in the tent in the land of legend  in fact the stunning colours throughout sabu and rozsas triumphant but still wistful finale conrad veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever this and casablanca and then died john justin and june duprez were great in the leading roles of lovers both of them slightly and refreshingly stilted but the parts didnt call for a huge range of emotions only pure love matteredbr br theres a couple of mildly violent images in it but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a 100 positive message its only a pity that nowadays little kids dont watch this instead of the porn they prefer one of my top 10 film favourites i cant recommend this too much  may it be shown to the end of time
0,those who have given this production such a low rating probably have never seen the celebrated george balanchine production live onstage or are letting their disdain for the star casting of macaulay culkin influence their judgement the atlanta ballet was fortunate enough from the 1960s to the 1980s to be the first ballet company authorized to stage this production other than the new york city ballet and i have seen it live onstage several times i can assure readers that the film is a quite accurate rendering of this production and that the use of a child with limited dancing abilities in the title role is not a cheap stunt dreamed up to showcase culkin it was balanchines idea to use a child in this role just as it was his idea to use a child for the role of marie the heavy dancing is left to the adults in the storybr br this is deliberately a stagebound film in a way it resembles laurence oliviers othello exactly as in that film the sets of the stage production have been enlarged to the size of a movie soundstage but not made any less artificial and the ballet is straightforwardly photographed with discreet closeups and without the distracting music video quick cuts featured in the 1986 overrated maurice sendakcarroll ballard version there are only two false steps in this 1993 film one is the addition of distracting and completely unnecessary sound effects mouse squeaks the children whispering magic to drosselmeyeretc those sound effects are never heard in any stage production of any nutcracker and they have been put in as a cheap concession simply to appease unsophisticated audiences who may not relish the idea of watching a ballet on filmbr br the other false step is macaulay culkins nutcracker makeup which looks absolutely ridiculous when he is on screen as the nutcracker rather than wearing a huge mask as is always done when the balanchine production is performed onstage culkin is actually made up as the toy  he wears what looks like a bald cap as well as a white wig whiskers and a beard he also has his face rouged up somewhat and the worst aspect of his makeup is that it is still recognizably his face amateurishly transformed in a manner similar to ray bolger jack haley and bert lahrs makeups in the wizard of oz that films makeup results though worked spectacularly as this ones does not and a comparison with baryshnikovs nutcracker in his production shows how wonderfully creative baryshnikovs nutcracker mask was  the jaws actually seemed to move whenever baryshnikov tilted his head backbr br the dancing itself in the macaulay culkin version is excellent of course except for culkin himself whose dancing as i said isnt meant to even be spectacular the sugar plum fairy and her cavalier are the prominent dancing roles in balanchines production of the nutcracker the films colors though could be a bit brighter since this is a fantasy the choreography is also brilliant and the adaptation of it is so faithful as to include the sequence that features additional music from tchaikovskys ballet the sleeping beauty  as marie sneaks downstairs falls asleep on the sofa and dreams that drosselmeyer is repairing the broken nutcracker this sequence was of course never included in tchaikovskys original balletit is the only sequence in this production which features music from a work other than the nutcrackerbr br those who have missed out on this film or those who despise or loathe it should give it a chance despite its two big drawbacks it is far better than it seems when one first hears that culkin is in it
7,i say id figure in that line because frankly ive not seen a hal hartley movie until now its not that i havent heard of him though as he was seen as one of those small ny filmmakers when i say small i mean even smaller than jim jarmusch who made ultrapersonal projects on limited budgets in an ironic way much as with pasolinis salo though in a slightly different context fay grim interests me to see some of hartleys more acclaimed features because there seems to be at least present some semblance of talent behind it as if hartley could be a very good filmmaker who may be so good hes just taken a big experimental blunder or on the other hand he could just be someone far too impressed with his own idiosyncrasies and wouldbe godardlike cinematic collisionsbr br i cant quite explain the story which may or may not be a problem i suppose however its not really in due to not having seen the film that preceded fay grim henry fool i think even if i had that experience it wouldnt make too much of a difference based on the final results theres a lot of international espionage a double plot wrapped inside of another thats fallen through the fake pockets of the title character played in an aloof way by parker posey not sure if thats good or bad either maybe both and also involving a cia operative jeff goldblum as usual a solid presence amid the mania even conjuring some laughs not to mention an orgyladen picture box and author henry fool its not that the script is totally impenetrable however much it goes into overextended loopholes just for the sake of it because there are some touches of witty or affectingly strange dialogbr br quite simply the direction just sucks harltey is in love with the third man which is fine but he imposes a consistently headache inducing style of everything being tilted in angle with characters having to get into frame equally oddly not since battlefield earth in fact has a director come off so annoyingly in trying to make the unnecessary choice of titled angles for some bizarre dramatic effect only this time hartley isnt amid a clusterf hes mostly responsible for it this along with the crazy wannabe godard titlecards that pop in here and there some a little amusing and some just totally stupid and the montage segments all in still shots and a couple of moments involving action that almost call to mind ed wood undermine any of the potential that is in the script which is already fairly hard to decipher in a way its fascinating to watch how bad this all goes but a kind of fascination that comes in seeing the flipside to total creative control on a sortof smallscale storybr br but let it be known youll likely not come across a more wretchedly pretentious example of american independent filmmaking this year
2,this film breeches the fine line between satire and silliness while a bridge system that has no rules may promote marital harmony it certainly cant promote winning bridge so the satire didnt work for me but there were some items i found enjoyable anyway especially with the big bridge match between paul lukas and ferdinand gottschalk near the end of the film it is treated like very much like a championship boxing match not only is the arena for the contest roped off in a square area like a boxing ring there is a referee hovering between the contestants and radio broadcaster roscoe karns delivers nonstop chatter on the happenings at one point he even enumerates one two three four as though a bid of four diamonds was a knockdown event and people were glued to their radios for it all a common event for championship boxing matches that spoof worked very well indeedbr br unfortunately few of the actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire paul lukas doesnt have much of a flair for comedy and is miscast lovely loretta young and the usual comic frank mchugh werent given good enough lines glenda farrell has a nice comic turn as a forgetful blonde at the start of the film but she practically disappears thereafter what a waste of talent
3,sidney franklins the good earth has achieved classic status thanks to a timeless story and superb acting especially from luis ranier who won an oscar for her portrayal of olan rainers performance is so complete she is nearly unrecognizable having very little dialogue throughout the entire film and it is a long one rainer relies instead on facial and body language she looks and acts chinese to the point that anyone unfamiliar with her work could easily mistake her as suchbr br the film remains relevant today because it explores the rags to riches story and the universal themes that come with it when lung and wife olan finally achieve financial success after years of famine and poverty they find a life full of possessions but lacking in meaning it is only when they return to the earth after fighting off a swarm of locusts the special effects used to create them are still incredible and beautiful to watch that they again find fulfillment a common formula told with the unique perspective of a chinese family especially for 1937 makes the film a classic money isnt worth anything without friends and family a point that the film drives home perfectly in its last 10 minutes with an emotionally fulfilling conclusion
2,i must have been only 11 when mr peepers started it was a must see for the whole family i believe on sun nights repeating gags were rob opening his locker he had to use a yardstick or pointer to gage the right spot on another locker and do some other things finally kicking the spot whereupon his door would open and taking pins out of a new shirtat the start of an episode he would open up a package with a new dress shirt and for the rest of the show be finding one pin after another that he missed when unwrapping the shirt timing was everything and the pins got lots of laughs i remember an aunt that drove a rio like jack benny and always wanted sonny to say something scientific he would think and come up with semi permeable membrane or osmosis causing her to say how brilliant he was you had to have been there marion lorne stole the show every time she was on screen why they didnt continue the series from her pov when wally quit he was afraid he was being typecast but by then it was way too lateill never know i saw somewhere that the 1st tv wedding big one anyway was tiny tim on the carson show horsecocky it was rob and nancy did i ever have the hots for her and i remember it made the cover of tv guide and got press in all the papers and major magazines a trip to the museum of broadcasting in nyc years ago was disappointing in that they had very few episodes then and those might be gone now i still remember it as wonderful and wish i had been a little older
3,every time i see nicole i like her more i love a movie like this a woman you just wont give up on but she keeps breaking your heart first movie i remember seeing like this was of human bondage the kim novak  laurence harvey version the beefs about the correctness of the russian spoken in this film are petty it was good enough to fool me or anybody else who cant speak russian im sure funny how people miss the point the nogoodnik russian guys were well cast too finally i have to tip my hat to ben chaplin as somebody else noted he plays a sap with great dignity and there was definitely some heat between him and nicole to think guys get paid for that mindblowing
5,perhaps one of the most overrated socalled horror classics ever made halloween does feature the memorable michael myers and some great acting by jamie lee curtisbr br however its rewatchability factor is very close to zero as there is an unforgivable amount of time spent on dullnessculmination to the actual eventsbr br this is the sort of movie you can walk away from to microwave popcorn and not miss anything at allbr br how it spawned so many sequels i will never comprehendbr br thank god rob zombie is remaking this and generally i hate remakesbr br surely he will more than compensate for all the random timefilling gaps with some quirky points of interest that the original severely lacksbr br this is a movie we feel we have to like much like the way were taught that we should enjoy dickensbr br dont assume this is a classic
5,they all laughed is one of those little movies i am always recommending to friends seeking something out of the ordinary it is firmly rooted in the screwball romance traditions of the past but seems more contemporary even the decidedly early 80s atmosphere doesnt date it too much bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet that reality never brings it crashing down to earth but that said this sort of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to keep it going and tal is blessed with a dream cast who understand the requirements of this sort of tale it is a movie that wouldnt linger so long in the memory if it werent for the little moments provided by the excellent cast colleen camps simultaneously shouting orders at john ritter and her dog blaine novak unleashing all that hair from under his hat and especially the moment dorothy stratten falls for john ritter and says howweird its such a piece of fluff one doesnt want to lay too much on it for fear of crushing it but it is certainly does leave one with a light heart and a smile on ones face
6,frustrated middleaged deputy district attorney george maxwell a fine performance by george e carey who also produced this picture cant stand his naggy frigid wife edith a perfectly bitchy anne bellamy anymore worse yet poor george is further saddled with a newborn baby sun and a lascivious lesbian teenage daughter dishy brunette sheri jackson george has an adulterous fling with lovely enticing and freespirited swinging hippie babysitter candy wilson delightfully played with sexy aplomb by yummy blonde knockout patricia wymer complications ensue when george finds himself being blackmailed by the bitter julia freeman a nicely venomous turn by kathy williams who wants george to spring her psychotic biker boyfriend laurence mackey a frightening robert tessier who sports a head full of hair here from jail director tom laughlin yep the same dude who portrayed billy jack and screenwriter james mclarty cram the splendidly seamy story with a winning and highly entertaining surplus of delicious female nudity sizzling softcore sex and raw violence moreover they accurately peg the whole wildneasy uninhibited sensibility of the 60s youth culture and relate the plot in a tight 75 minute running time thus ensuring that this movie doesnt overstay its welcome one definite highlight occurs when candy invites her groovy friends over the maxwells house for an impromptu basement bash complete with pot smoking wailing rock music and of course hot naked dancing chicks robert o raglands funky score hits the gnarly spot stanton foxs stark black and white cinematography adds an extra gritty edge to the deliriously sleazy goingson best of all this flick rates as a marvelous showcase for the utterly charming and freshfaced pixie patricia wymer who positively lights up the screen with her sweet bubbly personality and captivating beauty a total trashy treat
0,i was unlucky enough to have seen this at the sidewalk film festival sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin being a devout fan of lewis carrolls alice books i was very excited about this movies premier which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch normally im enthusiastic about modern retellings if they are treated well usually its interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion the adaptation of the originals characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying it probably didnt help that the actors werent very good either most performances were ridiculously over the top which i assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script i did not laugh once through out the duration of the film all of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their poignancy as time goes by really the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet alice but even then the score was a poor imitation of danny elfmans work also id have to say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave danceoff was awful it was with out a doubt the low point of the filmbr br what a joke dont see this movie after its conclusion i was genuinely angry
0,this tv movie goes to show that bad films do exist the only reason i saw this was it was covered on a ktma mst3k its super bowl at the superdome in new orleans however no football is played whatsoever and we see the behind the scenes look at basically nothing with the many stars in this film it made no difference i really dont know why i watched this
0,the only real highlight in the movie is the death of the sniveling guy and the reaction of the surviving characters to itbr br in every other way this film is a very lame ripoff of jaws lake placid and alligator with a little bit of godzilla 1998 thrown inbr br as is standard for a 1990sstyle horror movie the two nonstarring females each take their clothes off at least once the female lead doesnt since she obviously has a better agent br br the whole movie surrounds the filming of a really dumb extreme sport called blood surfing in which surfers cut themselves and surf in sharkinfested waters in this film a giant saltwater crocodile also happens to be in the area people get eaten the movie endsbr br i dont mind a bad horror movie but i really hate a dull bad horror movie which this definitely is
6,this film really deserves more recognition than its getting it really is a stunning and rich portrayal of blood ties favours and allegiances within the crime world the film is shot beautifully and delves into all youre classic crime themes such as betrayal and power this film is a movie goers film it requires attention and understanding and rewards fully in the end it is the godfather of hong kong and is a welcome change rather than another wire frame fighting martial arts epic which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world from hong kong and china it features an arrangement of great characters actors and development although is fair to say i had to watch it twice just to nail what was happening with some of the characters due to their being so many interactions in the film all in all 810 great plot characters but there are characters that dont stand out enough and the music didnt really get me going and at times i felt it didnt sync well with the actionthere is action by the way so it loses some points for that
1,i think thats this is awful produced and directed movie benicio del toro shouldnt work in production of movies he should put accent on his acting and thats it steven soderbergh missed the whole point of the idea about revolution about its ideals and most important about life of che guevara and so on camera is awful like someone with day working experience is shooting with it music is i dont knowis there some music in the movie i will not recommended this piece of sh to no one its just wasting about hours in front of the tv or whatever i cant figure out how can someone rate this movie more than stars disasterdisasterdisasterdisaster dont watch please save yourself from this misery of movie
0,i really liked this movie kurt manages to act without speaking letting moments speak for themselves he doesnt have to verbalize or rationalize his actions he simply decides and takes action he is supported by a good cast of actors and settings and is able to show us a more humane side of soldiers without getting to corny
4,the sentinel is one of the best horror movies already made in the movies industry i think it is very scary as very few movies actually are alison parker is a model with some fame she dates a lawyer called michael lerman and has as a best friend another model called jennifer everything was great in her life until she decides to live alone for some time and rents a beautiful and old apartmentbr br the problem are her neighbors who are very very strange suddenly alison starts to have health problems and faints with frequency she also remembers some painful facts about her past that makes her have nightmares or illusions but everything has a reason and it has to do with the new house she is livingbr br i personally find the sentinel a very creepy movie and along with the exorcist they are two of the scariest movies i already watched when we discover that alisons house is only occupied by the priest and herself my blood froze its also horrible to see that she needs to become blind in the end of the movie in order to be the new sentinel to keep the monsters away from our world
0,im a fan of columbo especially on a rainy saturday and it was fun to see oskar werner after fahrenheit 451 but this episode was very lacking the original plot and plot twists were obvious and could be guessed way in advance even years before the modern detective shows of today but it was amusing to see the crazy couch patterns and modern electronics equipment and of course the mandatory suburbanite humor poking fun at modern art for sale the hightech home is a jetsons or disney version of tomorrowland and fun to think of writers inventing those wayout gizmosbr br if its sunny outside go play as there are much better columbo episodes still we should be thankful for cable tv that these episodes are being broadcast
4,this is the best madefortv movie of alltime am i saying this because im a huge silverstone fan partially but even without her id still see it im a fan of serial killer genre films and believe this to be a great entry in that category also mary giordano easily ranks among alicias top five character creations totally memorable  like she really exists id have her on my side too if there was a mystery to be solved she plays the character like she does with her real life with complete confidence in everything she does seems sweet honest nicejust like she is in real life so is that acting yes indeed shes sort of a rebel once again this time shes not bad shes too good and a bit afraid to do things that seem above the law but she doesnt do things the normal teenager would do instead she spends her time reading detective mags and solves crimes a cliche abounds shes sort of avenging her fathers death in a different way than vigilantestyle at the time alicia seemed to be playing the same characters rebellious seductive without a parent a loner this happens here too but shes a bit nerdy this time around that doesnt matter shes still cool as a nerd check this out soon or else giordano will be investigating why you havent
6,if you have trouble dreaming you may give this movie a low rating but you just have to realize this movie was not made to please everyonebr br just people with a sense of humorbr br for those people the movie is great it plays on old science fiction movies and radio shows long gone most of witch where brated themselves along the lines of spaceballs and airplane you may need to stretch your imagination a little bit to get the jokes but it is well worth it
0,the only way to get anything out of this film is to approach it as a comedy seen in that light it does deliver br br if youre looking for a serious movie look somewhere else this film has absolutely no depth and offers little more than a cursory and one dimensional examination of issues with no insight whatsoeverbr br making a movie about stereotypes and then making every single character in your movie a stereotype is an extremely poor strategy  especially when those same characters only break their hackneyed molds in predictable stereotypical ways br br busta rhymes and ice cube make the film almost watchable and michael rappaport turns in a good performance but the script is so awful and the social commentary is so trite its hard to find anything redeeming
0,excellent film that reveals how people are connected to the taken for granted ordinary beads exchanged during mardi gras the film is much more than a commentary on globalization in fact it humanizes the workers in china the owner of the factory the bead distributor in new orleans and even the revelers in new orleans what stands out the most is the directors ability to tell a tricky story with complicated details in such a simple and seductive way his amazing access to the factory is another aspect thats intriguing and i only wish i knew how he got inside its a beautiful story without sentimentality or guilt associated with it and the conclusion provides hope without leaving people feeling alienated
0,i have seen miracles still happen now at least four times i never tire of this fantastic movie from the very beginning it holds a persons interest as the movie progresses and the plane crashes the story becomes very intense as we watch this young girl trying to survive alone and frightened in the amazon following a plane crash in which she was the only survivor losing her mother in this plane crash as well makes this movie even more dramatic as we see the perils this young girl had to endure during her ten days in the amazon to think this really did happen is just unreal and to think that anyone could actualy survive this is unspeakable as we see the wild animals snakes and other reptiles the enormous forests and wildlife as well as countless insects as the movie progresses we see the many dangers this girl has to face as she tries to follow the river in hopes of it leading her to a town remembering what her father told her about how a stream will always lead to a river and then into an even larger river and this means it will eventually lead to a community this young girl keep track of the tiny stream which eventually lead into a huge river all throughout the movie at times having to swim in dangerous waters alone frightened injured she always managed to keep going towards the end of this movie it was obvious she would not have been able to continue much longer as she had not eaten in ten days and only had water to drink and was very sick and tired from her perils eventually as she sees a canoe she realizes there has to be a village and men find her and they take care of her and then take her to a hospital where her father comes to see her after fearing she was dead along with the many other passengers such a dramatic movie and so heartwarming to see her fathers face when he sees his daughter is actually still alive after all this time in the amazon movies like this arent made much those days i will still see it again and i know i will never tire of it to think this girl was the only one single survivor of this airplane is just unspeakable also the fact she only maintained a few very slight injuries was even more remarkable whereas everyone else on this airplane perished in the horrific crash into the wilds of the amazon a brilliant movie superbly acted out indeed and one i will treasure forever and love to continue watching strongly recommended by me for sure
0,a fine martino outing this is a spirited and enjoyable giallo with fine performances from good looking cast and principally the two leads george hilton and anita strindbergbr br for me the jigsaw puzzle of a plot is so convoluted and confusing you just sit back and enjoy rather than try to anticipate just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a further series of twists enjoyable twists it has to be saidbr br sexy with plenty of gory kills this a well paced movie with london athens and greek coastal locations a super finale set upon aegean rocks wraps things up and much fun was had by all
0,have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of characters from beverly hills 90210 were thrown into a thai jailif so this is your movie this is midnight express for the mtv crowd that would be ok but the story was poorly executed contrived plot twists poor dialogue and unresolved issues abound this slight film did not earn the right to be as cryptic as it ends up being potential spoiler and impossibly preposterous plot linethe faux tension filled moment when the hotel employee discovers the girls do not have a room there and is about to kick them out this moment is innappropriately played with the same solemnity and gravity as the moment when they are arrested at gunpoint later the same hotel employee is somehow foundand bangkok is a big city mind you ive been there and testifies against the girls as if a couple of free mai tais warrant 40 years in prison cmon rent another day in paradise instead
7,this is an entertaining look at the gospel as presented by johnny cash adorned in black of course who sings a lot and narrates a bit also if you like johnny cash this film is quite enjoyable also note the blonde depiction of jesus in this workjust for fun try to think of five jewish men who have blonde hair anyway its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all
1,how anyone can say this is bad is beyond me i loved this show before i even saw it for reasons the story intrigued me jessica alba and james cameron please ignore the bad comments and please watch the whole first season before you decide that its bad because i know that if you watch the first season you will love it and go out and buy season as well as season on dvd and then join the campaign to get season madebr br i hate fox and im sure a lot of you dark angel fans hate them too they have a thing for canning good shows dont you all agree
1,edward montagnes tattooed stranger is supposed to play like a crime thriller with a little film noir mixed in for flavor instead its a poorly acted witless look into low budget and uninspired film making the plot is absurd and the acting excruciatingly stiff and amateurish john miles who had a rather thin resume in the industry grins and guffaws throughout and everyone else acts with the same verve as characters in a governmentmade filmstrip about driver safety the movie anticipates shows like leave it to beaver and father knows best in its unnaturally wholesome view of new york in 1950 why the viewer doesnt even get to see anyone light up a cig until some shapely woman is interviewed in a flophouse halfway through the movie the only thing the movie has going for it besides its brevity is the excellent location shots coordinated by william steiner the low budget of the film works in the cinematographers favor as the viewer is treated to wellframed shots of new york citys interiors and expansive exteriors unless you wish to enjoy the film for the choice of settings and camera angles i suggest watching practically any other movie
0,crime boss is directed by alberto de martino an italian crime drama partially filmed in hamburg germany an easily forgotten movie even in spite of a good car chase sequence this flick seems to lumber on almost aimlessly a new don takes over a powerful mafia family and finds himself fighting for his own life unwritten laws and ethics of the mafia code make it hard to trust in anyone especially when millions of dollars are at stake brutality and violence breed the same in return this can not be put on a shelf with the real gangster epics just the look of the film brings back memories of american drivein fare even the popular american actor telly savalas cant boost the calibre of this crime drama antonio sabato also stars withpaola tedesco guido lollobrigida serio tramonti and piero morgia
5,when friendship kills in my opinion is a very touching and kind of heartbreaking drama about the consequences of being anorexic or bulimic anytime lexi katie wright or jennifer marley shelton threw up i wanted to vomit myself its kind of hard to explain why if you ask me they should have been more cooperative about things however i did enjoy seeing them do things together as well as get lectured by their parents before i wrap this up id like to say if you ask me when friendship kills does indeed show you how being anorexic or bulimic can affect a persons body  now in conclusion i recommend this movie to everyone who hasnt seen it youre in for some tears and a good time so the next time its on tv kick back with a friend and watch it
5,a beautiful piece of childrens cinema buried in a world of archaic celticism setting the story around the famous book of kels believed to have been comprised by monks from the small island of iona off the western coast of scotlandbr br telling the tale of a young abbots apprentice who goes off into the forest in search of cromcruic the fierce headless horseman of pagan mythology in hopes of recovering a lost artefactbr br the films true beauty lies in its animation cell shaded in a bright and inspirational style of deep complexity resulting in a look of seem less simplicity deriving much from the artistic style of the brilliant cartoon network series samurai jack for its genius use of mark making and background depth the secret of kels creates a consistently affective celtic world living under the shadow of viking invasionbr br the history may be intensely inaccurate and the ways of life portrayed lacking realism but these facts are utterly irrelevant as the film sets itself in a world of fantasy and celticrevivalist mysticism the girl of the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion makes the picture what it is as she glides from branch to branch appearing and disappearing like a mysterious nymph with qualities resembling the legendary cheshire cat from alice and wonderlandbr br the secret of kels is an absolute treat for all genders all ages its a lovely piece of family cinemabr br dont expect to be awed but instead pleasantly impressed
4,interesting to read comments by viewers regarding omega code many of the overwhelmingly positive comments were lifted almost word for word from tbn broadcasts the movie looks as if it were made to go directly to video to be stocked besides the threepart rapture series that was done by some other religious group in the 70s dont remember it you wont remember this one either in a year or two this is the first movie i have ever seen where it was implied that it was your religious duty to go to it and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls very shameful this just goes to show that if you are a televangelists son you too can play highroller hollywood producer with lil ole ladies tithe money
7,this is the prime example of low budget winning over what would be a good story line lets bring back samaire armstrong having seen her work on the oc i know she can do better then find a better script and budgetbr br the special effects were so bad and mostly badly computer generated that it almost lost me with the first time the wolf was seen onscreen and samaire armstrongs alertchanging into a werewolf was done by reducing her at first to a bad gcif figure before she even begins to changefinal fantasys humans as well as pixars made these laughable think of the figure as a nude barbie dollbr br the story of was interesting though the idea of bloodline in werewolves is nothing new as it also got into the balance between evil maybe not so evil and the possible end of humankind should the two lines mate the subplot of a book of werewolf linage which effected some of the other characters in a spelllike manner for a while was effective but could have been expanded more in explaining what had happened in the past br br bring in a better script and direction and id come back again
4,the plot is so manipulative counting completely on the most uncredible and unthinkable decisions of the adults in each and every parenting decision the children are super as far as charm and delivery of the lines but as i say the whole plot depends on each and every adult being complete idiots and therefore in that case making more sense out of their actions and at the same time being the only way to explain the boys actions of total mistrust why would sweey charming little boys take a baby from the shore how did the baby get to the shore and at the same time account for it being the last place to be searched why would the boys never be informed an instead at the same time a baby is missing nobody gives a fig about them running around with food and diapers with all that commotion going on and literally every other place it searched there is just no possible justification to ask the audience to believe this asking to believe it would then do to trial even the informal setting is too insulting to bare
0,the second care bears movie is immensely better than its predecessor it has a deeper plot better character development and the tunes especially the closing song are both catchy and warmhearted sure the movie tends to over stress caring but come on it is a care bears movie this movie is a great picture to show to kids because it emphasizes friendship love and again caring not to mention the care bears are just too adorable
3,this movie has got to be one of the worst i have ever seen make it to dvd the story line might have clicked if the film had more funding and writers that would have cut the nonsense and sickly scenes that i highly caution parents on but the story line is like a loose cannon if there was such a thing as a drive thru movie makerthis one would have sprung from thatit reminded me a lot of the quickie films that were put out in the 1960s poor script writing and filming br br the only sensible characters in the whole movie was the bartender and beaver the rest of the film could have easily been made by middle school children i give this film a rating of as it is truly awful and left my entire family with a sense of being cheated my advicedont watch it
2,the third and last part of the bourne trilogy duh is lacking a bit in the story department but covers it with extensive action scenes twi in particular take up quite some of the running time and make this movie betterbr br the director and star damon themselves agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part because the end of the second movie was quite  advanced storywise how they got around that the action scenes for once but they did another thing too which i cant reveal because that would be a spoiler but if you watch the movie than youll notice it funnily enough i read that this adaptation of the bourne books is the least accurate of all three films  if that means anything to you o
6,its the nature of businesses to try to capitalize on others success here we have a movie taking elements from the earlier dracula 1931 and frankenstein 1931  in a germanic town the village leaders believe that vampires in the shape of bats have been the cause of recent deaths of bloodless victims even though shot at universal and at the bronson caves its a poverty row feature its not fair to compare it with those earlier more expensively made and superior filmsbr br from the familiar and exciting chilling music of the main titles which must have been by mischa bakalienikoff through the talky but well done opening sequence we anticipate the arrival of lionel atwill fay wray and dwight frye to give us a good 30s mystery film unfortunately it doesnt happen thats the disappointmentbr br we get little more than the formulaic elements of such films but with slow pacing low budget not enough of dwight frye the overdone presence of maude eburne aunt gussie and the premise for lionel atwill dr von niemann to require human blood or how he exhibits mind control over his servant emil robert frazier never made very clearbr br do not watch the technicolor dr x 1932  which also stars lionel atwill and fay wray but as father and daughter  before watching this the way i did its an oscar winner by comparison so watch this one first structurally the vampire bat still isnt that good it plods along with too much talking or unnecessary comic relief without focusing strongly on the vampiric villainybr br besides dr x and mystery of the wax museum both 1932 and co starring fay wray lionel atwills most famous appearances are as the one armed gendarme in son of frankenstein 1939 and as moriarity in sherlock holmes and the secret weapon 1943 dwight frye steals all his manic scenes in dracula 1931 as the young lovers melvin douglas and fay wray have a nice kissing scene but thats about it he can be seen in the old dark house 1932 and fay gets dragged around by joel mccrea in the most dangerous game 1930 then theres her 1933 classic screamer too bad more time money and rewrites werent available for this film to better showcase the talents and chemistry of lionel atwill fay wray and dwight frye sadly then this drearily disappointing film only gets a
6,i gather from reading the previous comments that this film went straight to cable well i paid to see it in a theatre and im glad i did because visually it was a striking film most of the settings seem like they were made in the early 60s except for the shrinks office which was dated in a different way and if you leave the neve campbell sequences out the whole film has a washed out early 60s ambience and the use of restaurants in the film was fascinating for a firsttime director whose background i believe is in writing he has a great eye within the first ten minutes i felt the plot lacked plausibility so i just willingly suspended my disbelief and went along for the ride in terms of acting and the depiction of fatherson motherson husbandwife parentchild relationships the film was spoton william h macy a pleasure to watch seems to be filling the void left by the late tony perkins if this and magnolia are any indication tracey ullman as the neglected wife was quite moving to me it was a threedimensional depiction of a character too often viewed by society as twodimensional of course donald sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable portrayals the depiction of the parents bainsutherland reminded me in an indirect way of vincent gallos buffalo 66 although toneddown quite a bit i would definitely pay money to see a second film from this director he has the selfdiscipline of a 50s bcrimefilm director something ptanderson will never have yet he has a visual style and a way with actors that commands attention
3,another channel great canned long before its time compelling acting from phil davis and the rest of the cast sexy intelligent and funny i remember watching it at the time and even then asking around noone had really heard of it but trying to find someone now who can recall it is even harder perhaps channel dont do their job well enough in drumming up the enthusiasm needed either that or the general public is too interested in the tv vomit that is big brother i suspect the latter downloading of garth merengies dark place prompted channel to release a dvd of that series lets hope the same can happen with north square
6,i got myself a copy of this film thinking it was the 1964 film with zombie bloodbath as one of its alternative titles perversely this film actually has a better rating on this site than the aforementioned title which may mean that the other one is really bad this film is pretty bad too obviously you cant go into a film that calls itself zombie bloodbath and expect to see a masterpiece and in fairness it does live up to the title with the amount of gore on displaybut it all feels very old and tired which isnt helped by the atrocious acting and stupid plot line its just your average nuclear spill causing people to turn into zombies etc etc the film kicks off with a sequence that sees people melting and that pretty much lets you know what youre in for low quality zombie garbage theres plenty of gore in the film and its a real good job otherwise the film would have been really boring zombie bloodbath looks really cheap too and was clearly put together by inexperienced filmmakers the main influence seemed to be romeros superior day of the dead although it could really be just about anything that features zombies and gore it all boils down to a typically predictable and pointless ending and overall i cant say i was impressed with it
6,i will stat of with the plot alice having survived the previous instalment of the nightmare series finds the deadly dreams of freddy krueger starting once again this time the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of alices unborn child his intention is to be born again into the real world the only one who can stop freddy is his dead mother but can alice free her spirit in time to save her own son this movie did start of really well as we see alice dreaming of being amanda kruger who get stuck in room and get raped by 100 manics then she being rushed to hospital but then she not longer the pregnant lady but then she amanda giving birth to freddy againbr br alice and dan are the only two people to return from the 4th movie and then have gotten some new friends its no long before freddy start to kill again i did like the first dead it okay not as good as the other deaths or dreamsbr br freddy himself didnt seem to be scary in this movie at all the nightmare were just boring really they were not scary or creepy at allbr br acting in movies was okay for a 5th movie in the series but overall i think this movie was really dull still not worst movie of the series freddy dead is the worstbr br 410
0,the best laurel and hardy shorts are filled to the brim with mishaps accidents and destruction mostly caused by stan but with ollie receiving the bulk  of the punishment see the great the music box 1933 or towed in a hole 1932 as some some classic examplesbr br here however for some reason is it because it was based on a sketch by stans father the boys play it straight in a comedy built around jokes and supposedly funny situations it doesnt come off its merely another thirdrate tedious 30s comedy heightened only by the personalities of stan and ollie who never really display any of their trademarked gestures ollies finger wiggling stans blank stares etc or comic abilitiesbr br the film begins with them running from the police since we never see or know why its hard to believe or accept their fear of being caught and thus hiding in colonel buckshots mansion the premise for the humor ollie passing himself off as the colonel and stan passing himself off as both the butler and the maid are never very engaging they are not playing stan and ollie in this film their parts could have been played by any of the pedestrian studio actors and it would be just as poorbr br stan could mime and make whatever he would do funny but he doesnt get the chance to do any of that here hes constrained by uttering too much dialog to move the plot but none of it rises much above the silly we are treated to endless third rate comedy chestnuts such as the running gag of not correctly pronouncing lord plumtrees name the call me a cab okay youre a cab joke cops losing their clothes and being seen in long johns and a nonsequiter ending of stan and ollie as the two parts in a painfully obvious horse costume as they make their escape on a bicycle for two and james finlayson is still doing his silentera full body takes and keystone kop jumping jacksbr br stan and ollie do much better in a situation comedy in sons of the desert1933 where we get to see them do what we love about them  be themselves in fact 193234 seem to be their best yearsbr br since this film does not play to any of their strengths why bother with it i have to give it a
1,i dont know what this movie is about really its like a students art school project they never say why the world is dark but it is always darkness except for seconds a day there are long interrupting shots of insects of all sorts for no reason what little dialogue there is in the movie is as inane and nonsensical as the images a black woman enters the main characters apartment somehow she becomes pregnant overnight then gets shot in the head the main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges i have never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movie can be honestly i would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think its about but i wouldnt wish this level of hell on anybody else
0,i was really hoping that this would be a funny show given all the hype and the clever preview clips and talk about hype i even heard an interview with the shows creator on the bbc world today  a show that is broadcast all over the worldbr br unfortunately this show doesnt even come close to delivering all of the jokes are obvious  the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame  and they are not given any new treatment or twist all of the characters are onedimensional the acting is  well  mediocre im being nice its the classic cbc recipe  one that always failsbr br if youre muslim i think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters and if youre white youd probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted ignorant or both not that making fun of white people is a problem  most of the better comedies are rooted in that its only a problem when it isnt funny  as in this showbr br canada is bursting with funny people  so many that we export them to hollywood on a regular basis so how come the producers of this show couldnt find any
0,supposedly based on the life of domino harvey a model turned bounty hunter id say 95  is fabricated i always keep an open mind when it comes to movies however this movie lost its chances when it became apparent it had narration throughout the film something i cant stand and to top it off the heroine of the story is so hateful and depicted as an arrogant bch i just wanted it to end with her being shot in the head its too incoherent too flashy and way too boring its a who gives a crap kinda story and i really think that big time directors need to make movies based on their own or a writers own imagination not something based on some ignorant snobby brats life
0,yet another die hard straight to video rip off with cardboard villains how many more of these god awful cheaply and badly made rip off of the more popular action movies of the late 1980s and early 1990s are there still lurking out there for the record not that you will care really this one is yet another blatant rip off of a combination of die hard under siege and speed complete with a full complement of clichs and predictabilitybr br the non descript villains are the usual selection of cardboard cut out gun toting thugs who are dispatched by various means as the film progresses the hero naturally is an ex cop or something that has family and attitude problems and of course he brings along to the party not only the usual emotional baggage but also a matching piece of eye candy and his annoying sonbr br the supposed luxury cruise liner that is running between florida and mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry  this goes someway to explaining how come they appear to be larking around on a rusty cross channel ferry  in new zealand the acting is as wooden as the deck the script woeful the one liners predictable the villains utterly inept and the plot has holes in it you could sail a boat throughbr br there seems to be a never ending tide of this sort of rip off straight to video rubbish polluting the late night slots of television and the dvd bargain bins of supermarkets everywhere although even this film is so bad it has yet to see a dvd release yet but give it time is there any chance of something at least half decently made semi believable and most important original no i thought not

7,the british production company amicus is generally known as the specialist for horror anthologies and this great omnibus called the house that dripped blood is doubtlessly the finest amicus production ive seen so far admittedly there are quite a few that i have yet to see though the house that dripped blood consists of four delightfully macabre tales all set in the same eerie mansion these four stories are brought to you in a wonderfully gothic atmosphere and with one of the finest ensemble casts imaginable peter cushing christopher lee cushing and lee are two of my favorite actors ever as well as denholm elliott and the ravishing ingrid pitt star in this film  so which true horror fan could possibly afford to miss it no one of course and the film has much more to offer than just a great cast the house that dripped blood revolves around an eerie rural mansion in which strange things are happening in four parts the film tells the tales of four different heirsbr br the first tale method for murder tells the story of horror novelist charles hyller denholm elliott who moves into the house with his wife after moving in the writer suddenly feels haunted by a maniac of his own creation the first segment is a great kickoff to the film the story is creepy and macabre throughout and the performances are entirelly very goodbr br in the second story waxworks retired businessman phillip grayson peter cushing moves into the house and suddenly feels drawn to a mysterious wax museum in the nearby town the great peter cushing once again delivers a sublime performance in this and the rest of the performances are also very good the tale is delightfully weird and the secondbest of the film after the thirdbr br the third tale sweets to the sweet is by far the creepiest and most brilliant of the four john reed christopher lee moves in with his little daughter the private teacher and nanny mrs norton whom mr reed has employed to instruct his daughter is appalled about her employers strictness towards his daughter and is eager to find out what reason the overprotective fathers views on upbringing may have this best segment maintains a very creepy atmosphere and a genuinely scary plot christopher lee is as always superb in his role nyree dawn porter is also very good as the nanny and my special praise goes to then 11yearold chloe franks this ingenious segment alone makes the film a mustsee for every true horrorfanbr br in the fourth segment horroractor paul henderson jon pertwee moves into the house with his sexy mistresscostar carla ingrid pitt this fourth story is satire more than it is actually horror it is a highly amusing satire however and there are many allusions to other horror films at one point henderson indirectly refers to christopher lee who stars in the previous third segmentbr br all four segments have a delightfully macabre sense of humor and a great atmosphere as stated above the third segment is by far the creepiest and greatest but the other three are also atmospheric and often macabrely humorous horror tales that every horror lover should appreciate an igenious atmosphere a macabre sense of humor genuine eerieness and a brilliant cast make this one a mustsee in short the house that dripped blood is an excellent horroromnibus that no lover of british horror could possibly afford to miss highly recommended
7,how this movie got made with a supposedly 70 million budget and without being completely retooled is beyond me the storyline and dialogue are beyond amateurish characters say things no real person would ever say and almost never react to things that were said before no one seems to be grounded in the real world the acting of the leads is fine given that the writing is such a dudbut several actors in supporting roles really drag the production down the heros hair probably shouldve gotten its own credit it was so oddly attention grabbingnot to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the pic finally for a movie about la being besieged by giant reptiles this film is shockingly boring what a shame if you do see this your mind will be constantly racing thinking up ways that you could have taken the sfx scenes and built a far better movie around them sadly it wouldnt have taken much
0,what a perfect example of less is more kurt russell sgt todd only has 72 lines and something like 104 words what a challenge like a black and white photo when your minds eye has to fill in the blanks the facial expressions the physical drama the emotive gesture all combines to make a stronger impact this is one of those top movies i cant live without right up there with the classics like road warrior if you liked this check out mad max the road warrior and braveheart both starring mel gibson also gladiator with russell crowe and connie nielsen who was in soldier also the thirteenth warrior starring antonio banderas and blade runner starring harrison ford
3,the late great robert bloch author of psycho for those of you who werent paying attention scripted this tale of terror and it was absolutely one of the scariest movies i ever saw as a kid i had to walk miles just to see a movie and it was usually dark when i emerged from the theater seeing a horror movie was always unnerving but particularly so when it was as wellexecuted as this one when i had the opportunity to see this one several years ago on videotape which should always be a last resort i was surprised at how well it held up take the terror test watch it at night alone and then tell me its not scary
5,when viewing a movie as silly as hot rod one must sit back relax and alter ones intellectual capacity to a like state  which is in this case a state dimwitted enough to endure brainless drivel that has somehow been mistaken for comedy with a brief runtime of 88 minutes this film was long past drawnout and buried itself beneath a bundle of repetitive jokes  jokes that came at a minority and werent even funny in the first place hot rods base material is as superficial and irrelevant as 2004s cult hit napoleon dynamite though its much more contrived and comes without any of the laughter in fact the movies blatant desperation to be compared to napoleon dynamite is scornful and offensive and left me ticked off instead of just being annoyedbr br the movie if one were compelled enough to call it such poses a paltry story that puts selfproclaimed stuntman rod kimble before us with the trifling intention of jumping fifteen buses one more than his idol evel knievel jumped so were told by rod and raising 50000 dollars for his stepfathers impending lifesaving heart operation all so that he can fight his stepfather once recovered and gain his respect because in order to gain ones respect one must first fight them huh whatever each character is no more interesting than rods stickon mustache and from the films opening joke to its ridiculous conclusion each scene played like a nonsensical and terribly unfunny snl skit  which with the addition of an extra 85 minutes is essentially what hot rod strives to bebr br the films star andy samberg contributed an effort to the screen that observably exerted every last dripdrop of his comedic capabilities unfortunately  rather realistically  his humorous talents are no more admirable than a fiveyearold retelling his own exhausted joke that somewhere includes the innocently crude poop and peepee gags and if thats disappointing pull a chair hide your face in your hands and brace yourself for the real blow he is the films humor to rescue them of their mortification ill willingly omit the ghastliness of sambergs costars roles and leave the second third of the lonely island team director akiva schaffer to his nonexistent talent as a director or a comedian basically every thing one could possibly do to further trample a crashcourse comedy is perfectly portrayed here and done so arrogantly as though the film would be funnier that way trick yourself into believing that theres even a single laugh in this heap or treat yourself to another movie  any other movie
5,scarface has a major cult following even now 22 years after its releasebr br it has also been widely criticized as being very tacky unrefined overthetop and all bloated up these are people who compare scarface to the godfather movies it is true that on the technical front cinematography screenplay direction etc scarface is way behind the godfatherbr br but it is also true that what scarface has and some other gangster movies lack is the rawness the sheer crude approach of the gangsters the latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished italian or irish gangsters from other gangster classics like the godfather or goodfellas this is one of the major winning points of scarface and i strongly believe that this fact has been written off as tackiness by most critics i have seen the original 1932 scarface and i must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the remake br br al pacino has been criticized to be overthetop and loud in this movie but how about considering that that is precisely the way the filmmakers wanted tony montanas character to be he is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute he is not the calm michael corleone here he is tony montana a very tacky uneducated individual who doesnt really think much and gets angry all the timebr br there is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie the soundtrack is all 80s i love some of the songs including gina and elviras theme push it to the limit and the title track instrumentalbr br there are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences including the famous chainsaw scene the rebenga hit the first meeting with sosa and tonys visit to his mothersbr br about the performances al pacino is brilliant as the angry cuban refugee he has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing tony montana the most in his entire career and it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes one wonders what scarface would be like without pacino i just couldnt imagine anyone else portraying tony montana and in all probabilities the film wouldnt be as effective without himbr br steven bauer shines as tonys friend mannybr br robert loggia is wonderful as tonys boss lopez so is f murray abraham as omar in a small rolebr br then there is some eyecandy in the form of elvira played by michelle pfeiffer she looks beautiful and is adequate in her rolebr br the director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax without revealing anything i would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handlingbr br scarface is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out enjoy it for what it is a raw portrayal of the drug lords and their gangland
1,chuck joness hare conditioned is a fast paced often hilarious cartoon pitting bugs bunny against a strange yellowskinned apartment store manager who wants to have him stuffed hare conditioned takes full advantage of its multipurpose setting the chase takes bugs and his pursuer through a variety of departments leading to an inspired gag in which they quickly emerge from various departments wearing whatever clothes are associated with that part of the store this great gag is trumped however by a truly inspired sequence involving elevators in which bugs disguised as an elevator boy tricks the store manager into relentlessly getting on or off elevators at the wrong time its a brilliant climactic set piece which unfortunately gives way to a not very funny final gag by that time however hare conditioned has made its mark as one of the great chase films bursting with wild energy as bugs was becoming more refined in some of the other cartoons from this period hare conditioned showed that he could still be just as appealing as a more anarchic character
7,la teta i la luna the breast and the moon describes the life of a 910 year old boy named tete who is obsessed with breasts growing up in catalunya i love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human like all the characters in bigas lunas movies also director of jamon jamon tete reminded me of how intriguing and exciting life can be at that age also being from catalunya northeast of spain it brought lots of memories to my mind this movie shows how beautiful catalunya is nice people nice life and specially lots of nonuptight people
4,has to be one of the worst wastes of 35mm movie film ever unleashed on the public the sequel to the at least entertaining pseudodocumentary original film the legend of boggy creek bad script worse acting etc etc dawn wells had to be hoping that gilligan would come rescue her and take her back to the island just to escape from this piece of claptrap
5,this show probably wont appeal to everyone sarah does what she wants she doesnt ask for permission and she doesnt apologize this is a sitcom with zombies robot dinosaurs flying cars and a team of walletstealing male cheerleaders the star of the show is not a hero she is a spoiled bigoted pervert if you cant appreciate the offbeat humor it offers the show probably isnt for you everyone should at least give this show a chance it brings together the comedic styling of sarah silverman brian posehn the comedians of comedy jay johnston mr show steve agee bobcat goldthwaits stay and the creative energies of rob schrab and dan harmon heat vision  jack monster house it also showcases the best talents of the burgeoning online community channel101com if youre into this show keep an eye out for the department of acceptable media on vh1 this march itll be drawing from the same talent poolbr br watch sarah silvermans show this kind of stuff is the future of entertainment
5,unless you are between the ages of 10 and 14 except for the r rating there are very few things to like here one or two lines from kenan thompson david koechner we really should see him more and sam jackson are humorous and julianna margulies is as good as she can be considering her surroundings but sadly thats it poor plot poor acting worse writing and delivery the special effects are dismal as much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke the significant individual embedded situations are all equally terrible if we consider the action portions well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you giddy and there are some that make you groan this movie only contains the latter kind this leaves little left im so glad i did not pay for thisbr br despite any hype i can read and think so as i sat down to watch i did not expect anything good i had no expectations but was somewhat worried going in yet like a train wreck one cannot merely look away and even with no expectations i was let down bad not even so bad its good material im _very_ tolerant of bad movies but this makes six string samurai which i liked oscar worthybr br no this piece of over cgid rubbish is in the same company as battlefield earth little man and gigli how this is currently rated a 72 completely mystifies me brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all that i can think of as answersbr br i could go on and on but suffice to say that tonight i witnessed a train wreck i need to go wash my eyes of 10
5,at what point exactly does a good movie go bad when does a movie go from watchable to wheres that off switch thank goodness for dvds like this one that can be borrowed from the library  for free likewise thank goodness for the fast forward switch on the dvd player i feel sorry for those people who were duped at the box officebr br at one point ive forgotten exactly when because now its all just a blur our hero luke wilson starts running through traffic i think he was looking for a cab it was at that point when i gave up realizing i couldnt care whether he found his ride or got run over by a garbage truckbr br the last time the movie was interesting was when luke wilson climbs out of the dumpster hair dryer in hand and first meets the heroine uma thurman that scene ended with the pursesnatching criminal dangling helplessly from the fire escape far far above the departing luke and uma that was the last time the movie was funny and when was that scene ten minutes into the flickbr br every time the movie tried to become funny it couldnt every time the movie approached excitement it fizzled out heading in the opposite direction when a musical score might have helped squeeze life out of this dullard the sound track stayed empty and silentbr br the sex scenes were not needed and were beyond lame the damage to sets and props unnecessary and childish when uma turns into the crazy exgirlfriend i felt like i was watching the 40 year old virgin meets pulp fiction thats when i realized that there was no turning back because i thoroughly disliked the 40 year old virgin and pulp fictionbr br luke wilsons sidekick rainn wilson also seen in the dreary the last mimzy adds nothing but insult to injury in this awful movie rainn wilson the king of television boredom should stay with that equally awful medium hey rainn wilson leave fulllength motion pictures alone every time umas rival anna faris came on screen i expected jason or freddy or some fright flick monster to jump out from behind the scenery once you see anna faris in scary movie thats all you ever see no matter the movie no matter the medium the character played by wanda sykes was just plain awful and was so out of place in this flick
7,you know what kind of movie youre getting into when the serial killer main character is being transported to the electric chair in what seems to be a bakery truck only to have the prison vehicle collide with and im not making this up a genetic engineering tanker truck the goo which spurts forth melts him and fuses his dna with the snow creating our protagonist the killer snowmanbr br my favorite portion of the movie however is an overtheshoulder shot of the snowman thrashing some poor schmuck in which his hands look suspiciously like a couple of white ovenpotholder glovesbr br mmmmm schlock
0,yet another example of what british cinema can achieve a simple story told and acted well brenda blethyn gives a layered and warming performance as the recently widowed and financially straitened grace ably assisted by a solid supporting cast the quirky small town card gets played to the hilt similar to many tv series and films that have come from the british isles in recent years ballykissangel hamish macbeth and others come to mind like the forementioned this film makes use of some ravishingly beautiful rural scenery in this case the wet and wild cornish coastbr br some viewers might find wholesale acceptance of cannabis use a bit challenging others might find the ending just a little too cute and safe but its an enjoyable spliff to be sure
0,i love this movie very much i watched it over and over i dont see why anyone would think this movie wasnt good maybe you have seen better or whatever it is i personally love it it is one of my favorite movies and i am not hindi at all but i do love it it might be a little like pretty woman but i havent seen that and i dont think its any better than this i dont know why you are all trashing about it but maybe you have a good reason but i think i have said it enough but i absolutely love this movie and to those who say its not good at all well then i wonder why you watched it and what movies you consider good as for everyone else that i watched it with they enjoyed it too so it surprises me that this many people dont like it as for rani mukherjee  i think thats how you spell her last name she is very beautiful and my favorite actress ever
3,this film had so much promise i was very excited about this film in the end it was laughable at best painful at worst the acting styles ran the gamut from really really flat the angels the wife and daughter to overanimated caspers character i felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other pay special attention to the scene regarding the bug its pretty much an insult to the audiences ability to figure things out in defense of that scene though it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie i had read that they spent alot of money traveling to various overseas locations too bad they didnt make use of it i didnt feel like i was transported to exotic locations anybody could insert stock footage of the coliseum in rome however to end on a positive note i thought the sets were pretty good i really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers it is my opinionand thats all it is that if the schmaltz factor would have been much much lower and the action factor would have been greatly increased this film would have been good
3,i can remember this movie from when i was a small child i loved it then and i still do now i managed to get it on dvd for my 18th birthday and was over joyed because i had found it so difficult to find it previously and it had only be rented when i was younger my favourite character is charlie because he learns to be a good dog the movie is filled with fun songs and music the animation is brilliant and the character voices are perfect this movie has always been a tearjerker for me but i think that if i hadnt seen the movie when i was small then i would not find it as brilliant and fascinating as i do although i still believe that i would still like it because i am really into animated movies
2,poor will would be rolling over in his grave if he could this this horiible germantv adaptaion of his classic play its obvious that very little money was spent on it a stage riser a catwalk and some randomly placed columns pass off as a set the movie was ineptly dubbed into english with the english voice actors occasionally mumbling their lines the whole production had an incredibly dark and dreary feel to it and just where was fonterbras in this movie anyway mst3k gave this sorry production the treatment it justly deservedbr br to be or not to be i wish this movie never was in the first place
5,just resaw this movie after thirty seven years i was eleven years old and caught this flick on south beach at the long gone cinema theater on washington avenue in 1969 i thought where its at was a very good movie now however after almost forty years its not as good as it was times have changed and this movie is now a tired old rehash of the war between the generations it did however catch a place in time which is just a memory its really interesting to see the mod fashions the old vegas a slim don rickles chain smoking and a hip opening song the acting was decent the script somewhat outdated but the memories were still fresh where its at may not be where its at for you but for me it was still a nice and entertaining trip down memory lane
4,if you watched this movie you know why i said jesus jesus jesus hehehe every time they said jesus jesus jesus i laughed thinking jesus jesus jesus why did i rent this movie i cannot believe how oscar winners like freeman and spacey appeared here in the background while timberlake and ll cool j grabbed the screen wtf is timberlake dreaful acting i think someone like joshua jackson could have done a much better job this job was perfect for joshua jackson and believe me i am not a big fun of him but i really prefer an actor not this android called timberlake and his girlfriend was shallow hollow and annoying as hell i was happy when they both were popped in the streetbr br the story was ok and i think dylan mc dermott did his bad guy role very well the movie was entertaining but i think timberlake ruined it all it would have been much enjoyable without himbr br by the way the music was ok but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a mtv video clip with flashes low motion and things like that something misplaced for this cops movie i thought maybe they wanted to make a mtv video clip for timberlake
0,cillian murphy and rachel mcadams star in this actionthriller written and directed by the master of suspense wes craven himself the whole movie starts with some trouble at the lux atlantic a hotel in miami the problem is all fixed by lisa reisert the manager of the hotel then she goes to the airport and thats where all of the trouble begins she meets jackson rippner who doesnt like to be called jack because of the name jack the ripper if you know you him and i mean then they board the plane and crazy enough rippner and reisert sit next to each other for the next halfhour lisa is terrorized tormented and terrified by rippner i wont give anything away then we move on to where jack is chasing lisa in the airport then lisa goes to her house to see if her father is okay and crazily enough rippner is already there there is nearly twelve minutes of violence and strong intensity throughout that entire scene in total about 25 minutes of intense action comes at the endbr br not only was the movie intense but it had a great plot to it like i said i will not give anything away because its so shocking and thrilling and somewhat disturbingfrightening and the acting from every single character in the movie even the ones with no lines at all were all pitch perfect it was incredible everything was awesome in this movie the acting the music the effects the makeup the directing the editing the writing everything was wonderful wes craven is definitely the master of suspense red eye is definitely a mustsee and is definitely worth spending your money on you could watch this movie over and over and over again and it would never ever get boringbr br red eye i have to say is better than 10 out of 10 starsbr br original mpaa rating pg13 some intense sequences of violence and languagebr br my mpaa rating pg13 some very intense sequences of violence and languagebr br my canadian rating 14a violence frightening scenes disturbing content
5,the odd couple outta starsbr br like most people i will always feel that jack klugman and tony randall are the definitive odd couple their incredible work on the tv series from the early to mid70s was a highwater mark for television at the time easily surpassing the stage and screen versions of the tale nonetheless how can you go wrong with a jack lemmonwalter matthau pairing matthau is in especially good form as oscar the slob lemmon takes a bit of getting used to as felix particularly if you have previously seen tony randalls outstanding performance the script is good definitely neil simons best i will go on record here as stating that neil simon is probably one of the worst most overrated playwrights of american theatre the storyline is simple felix a neat freak and newly separated from his wife moves in with oscar the slob who needs some help saving money for alimony payments their living arrangement becomes much like a marriage as well culminating in some amusing tiffs and spats lots of fun and some great oneliners
4,this movie is the first of the six infamous guinea pig movies and is one of the best at the same time it looks realistic and unrealistic just knowing that the movie is fake the story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways a man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address and it includes a manga video showing the torture the men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die some scenes are shocking such as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking like the girl being punched 100 times because you see punches in nearly every movie this movie has a lot of gore so i would recommend this to people 17 or olderbr br 910
7,it could have been a morbidly fascinating look at the life of one of americas most notorious serial killers but sadly it doesnt even come close terrible editing direction bad acting you name it this movie is literally about 10 minutes of plot stretched into 100 the only redeeming quality is bruce davidson as the father but thats not nearly enough to save this stinker a out of 10
7,i have complained to abc about the cancellation of six degrees if enough people do the same then it could be enough to bring this fabulous show back to life just go onto the official site and the rest is simple enough i do not understand why this show has been cancelled what a fantastic show cast and characters the whole concept is gripping viewing i am astounded that my favourite show is over after just one series why is this six degrees is phenomenal its better than so many other tv programmes out there until i heard they were stopping it from a friend it hadnt even occurred to me that this might happen
2,i ended up watching this whole very long movie because i was fascinated by the sheer stupidity and naivity of it it seems difficult to believe that so many famous people anthony quinn lawrence olivier john gielguld vittorio de sica etc would have willingly participated in this farce but maybe in 1968 people really were so naive the plot seems written by some confused latin american marxist priest with an agenda there is a superpower conflict and the russians are actually the good guys with the communist party general secretary being a nice and spiritual man who suddenly after 20 years sees the light and feels compelled to ease his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner priest from a siberian gulag the priest then promptly becomes the pope by a series of coincidences we are allowed to see the secret vatican papal voting process which is portrayed in the most hillariously pious form you can possibly imaginebr br meanwhile the communists in china achieved the usual socialist economic miracle of starving half of their country to death to solve this minor hiccup on the relentless shining path towards communism they want to start a nuclear war in order to justly distribute the western capitalist riches to the poor workers of chinabr br our good old comrade general secretary gets a bit worried and calls the pope just before his coronation to ask him to broker peace they meet with the chinese leader comrade peng who looks and acts like a 15 year old boy you will roll on the floor laughing about what people in 1968 thought the chinese looked like comrade peng demands that the western capitalists must pay which is quite logical after all dont capitalists always have to pay for the madness of the socialists and that the pope needs to sacrifice something too for the common altruistic cause of equality and social justicebr br so when the pope gets crowned in rome he pledges the entire wealth of the catholic church worldwide to feed our poor chinese brethren in christ and thus he saves the world from nuclear holocaustbr br apart from this there are also some minor subplots which alas provide little to redeem this incredibly bad movie id give it three oscars for stupiditybr br by the way anthony quinn looks quite unlikely as a pope he is much more plausible as zorba the greek
1,im not quite sure if the term serious comedy applies to this movie im not even sure if this can be applied on the last few years movie theaters have become filled with comedy movies which are way too stupid to even make us grin therefore i considered the movies which do not fill these requirements as serious comediesbr br does the 40 year old virgin fit into this guild that is finally up to you but in my opinion this is a very funny movie you get to laugh a lot plus it delivers a social commentary through some really great characters and situationsbr br im pretty there is more than one 40 year old virgin out there and even the people whom do not exactly fit this specifications may feel identified by one of the characters in the movie especially menbr br the story as the title says it is about andy a shy silent guy whom collects action figures watches survivor with his octogenarian neighbors and whose favorite band is asiabr br kal is andys coworker at smarttech he believes andy to be a psychopath until andys secret is revealed kal is clearly a sexual pervert but yet he seems to get what he wants with the opposite genrebr br david is the passionate guy who is still in love with his exgirlfriend whom ran away with another guy and jay a man in a relationship which seems to be affected by his continuous cheating and getting caught actsbr br im pretty sure most youngsters from 13 to 21 have already watched this film but it really does not have an age limit to be able to enjoy it so in case you havent seen it and will enjoy a little laugh with social commentary than go to your video store and rest from those deep and depressing independent filmsbr br it also includes dvd bonuses which youll really see from top to bottom
1,i think ive seen all of the grisham movies now and generally theyre all very poor except for the rainmaker but this one is so bad its unbelievablebr br warning spoilerishbr br its one of those movies where the character does the stupid irrational things that no one would ever do hes a lawyer for christs sake why when his children go missing does he not call the police oh yes its because all the police hate lawyers so theyre just ignore him and let him be attackedbr br when hes arrested for murder they just let him go free he would be locked up in a cell pending a bail hearing br br why would you drag your kids halfway across the country when you could easily protect them at homebr br the police dont bother to try and find an escaped mental patient they dont bother to interview his daughterbr br as for the ridiculous endingbr br in summary silly very unrealistic and a complete waste of timebr br 010  one of the worst films ever made
1,theres never a dull moment in this movie wonderful visuals good actors and a classical story of the fight of good and evil mostly very funny sometimes even scary a true classic a movie everybody should see
2,three daring daughters is a sickly sweet rosecolored look at divorce remarriage and singleparent living obviously social issues and economic difficulty have no place in the picture perfect life of a single parent mother who feels exhausted takes a cruise and then dates and marries a band conductor even when the its just a movie phrase excuses the script from addressing reallife problems daughters suffers from too many incoherent highnote songs children whose personalities are not based on real children and band leader hose iturbi playing himself isnt it bizarre that any real person would star in a film in which their supposed real self gets married br br admittedly this movie was released in the nineteen forties only a love for old style hollywood romance and comedy could make daughters a tolerable film
6,this is a great film from reading other reviews i can see that im not the only one who shed a tear tamilyn tomita acted with such skill and conviction she made the ending heartfelt and memorable in the hands of a lesser actress her last scene would have seemed trite and corny one would never guess this film was done on a tight limited budget the cinematography is gorgeous and there are a number of big name actors the script is so wonderful i can see why they all wanted to be in it if you watch the long long list of credits at the end youll see that half of hawaii pitched in to make this film happen and for good reason the soundtrack available on cd is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood throughout the film my only complaint is that i almost didnt want the film to end
0,this film is not funny it is not entertaining it does not contain one single second of originality or intelligence nor does it lead you to take the slightest interest in the characters or situation added to that its about as juvenile a movie as anything in recent memory its as if a group of 14 or 15 year old high school kids who had never actually met or had any type of relationship with a real girl had sat down and wrote a movie based on their incorrect fantasies about what being an adult man would be like this movie is boring obnoxiously mindnumbing and at times offensive and disgusting at most it contains one or two moments that make you laugh also it seems twice as long as its 85 minute running time
2,across the country and especially in the political landscape people with any kind of political ambition should take time out to see this film the movie is called  city hall  and with little imagination its synopsis can take place anywhere in america it just so happens to open in new york here we have the story of a popular politician named mayor john pappas al pacino with enough savvy to run a major metropolitan city with very little effort his righthand man is none other than deputy mayor kevin calhoun john cusack an equally bright individual whos ambitions are tied to his mentor and both seemed destined for higher office everything points in that direction until a police shooting ignites an investigation spearheaded by marybeth cogan bridget fonda who believes the guilt points towards city hall and the mayor a six year old boy and a police officers death are blamed on a career criminal whos questionable freedom leads to an apparent coverup by political payoffs and city corruption involving union leaders like danny aiello played by frank anselmo corrupt judicial officials like judge walter stern martin landau and mafia bosses like paul zapatti anthony franciosa who are deeply involved also implicated are party officials like larry schwartz richard schiff who works for the probation office of new york but it is the bond between the mayor and his deputy which is taken to task by the accidental shooting a great vehicle for cusack and a sure bet nominee to become a classic 
6,this was a disappointing film the people seem to have no substance the lead protagonist martin cahil has zero redemptive values in fact everyone in it including jon voight epitomizes sleeze i would not recommend this film to anyone the violence is distasteful though artfully done the filming is to black at least the print i saw fit this category a disappointment
4,so this is what actress kim basinger has succumbed to mmm to tell the truth the films title is something quite eye grabbing to getting your interest and plot outline reads so basic but simplicity can have its strengths anyhow by the end of while she was out i was left feeling rather indifferent not the worse despite being engulfed by negatives but theres easily way better in what is an causally lukewarm but compact and unbalanced latenight survival fable of a feeble suburban housewife stranded in the woods trying to fight for her life after she witnessed the death of a rent a cop that came to her aid when she provoked an ugly exchange with some punks in a shopping car parkbr br the problem here falls on the misguidedly erratic and foreseeable material taken from a short story along with the very variable performances the flimsy script was poorly thoughtout which isnt so good when your plot has a slight structure to hang off so many wretched inclusions and dubious actions just go on to find its way in this endless chain of events as for the bunch of stereotypical goons led by an unconvincing lukas hass as a loose canon terrorizing basinger well they were less than threatening but hopelessly clueless watching basinger scrounging around in the dank wilderness with a red tool box in her hand dont ask me why knocking off these wannabe punks one by one became ridiculous because it didnt elicit tension or emotion but instead clumsy jolts that were absurdly daft because of the stupidity of the lead up basingers performance is stoutlike but doesnt craft much empathy craig sheffer shows up as her hotheaded husband strangely i couldnt keep my eyes off the screen thinking to myself that red toolbox is hypnotic why would she be constantly carrying it and what tool was she going to use to dispatch the next thug her choices were quite disappointing watching her transformation through the traumatic situation when things are finally turned around is rather empty due to its unsure tone and the ending is something you could see miles aheadbr br susan montfords soberly slick direction lacks cohesion and energy as it pretty much chugs along i liked the opening credits though with its hauntingly sullen score which is the most effective thing throughout the feature and polished photographybr br no great shakes doesnt ask much of your time but i wouldnt care to see it again however with the inclusion of a joy division song it made me grab a couple of their albums for a listen
0,this movie is definately one of my favorite movies in its kind the interaction between respectable and morally strong characters is an ode to chivalry and the honor code amongst thieves and policemen it treats themes like duty guilt word manipulation and trust like few films have done and unfortunately none that i can recall since the death of the policial in the late seventies the sequence is delicious down to the essential living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake no such scenes are present or needed the argument is sand honest to the spectator an important asset in a genre that too often achieve suspense through the deception of the audience no this is not miss marble a note of congratulations for the music is in order a film to watch and savor every minute not just to see
6,this movie represents the times it was made in as much as the original i suppose which is really sad because at a deeper level the title vanishing point the original is so ironic im sure it wasnt intended that way but the original was filmed in 1970 and released in 1971 the real vanishing point was the end of an era which pretty much ended in the early 1970s br br in this remake all the countercultural elements have been stripped away and been rendered more pc in an attempt to reach a broader audience presumably sanitized for your protection br br inserting the american indian scenes was gratuitous and the idea of a noble purpose to the trip was subtraction by addition im glad i watched it however it made me appreciate the original that much more the original is a cult classic and golden this remake is dreadful
1,for a film with so much promise it was disappointing thinly plotted and the acting ranging between horrendous and unbelievablethe plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese and its the worst clichd ending ive seen in a movie for some time the final scene would have ripped my heart out if the entire movie hadnt been so painful to begin with i was numb from the very first scene  one was left wondering if the sister was trying to reach out to her twin for help or simply scare her to death which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hours of the worst acting ive seen to date it was a horror in the true sense of the word
7,theres nothing quite like watching giant robots doing battle over a desert wasteland and robot wars does deliver sure the acting is lousy the dialogue is subpar and the characters are onedimensional but it has giant robots the special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period they are certainly not as polished as todays standards but it contains a minimum of computer graphics and instead uses miniatures so it has aged fairly well its shortcomings are easily overlooked given the films short runtime and it does have a certain tongueincheek humour in parts that make it quite enjoyable i would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or cheesy scifi who is looking for a lighthearted hour of distraction
1,imagine turning the american national anthem into a cartoon throw in a couple of cute animals some terrible puns and a pair of roller skates and youd find yourself with almost an exact replica of this filmbr br i remember seeing this when i was younger i made my mother rent it from the video shop about times the story itself isnt too bad its just that any marxists watching would certainly have something to complain aboutbr br if you dont like america you wont like this film
0,nina foch delivers a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun little gothic nailbiter she accepts a position as secretary to a london society dowager played imperiously by dame may witty and her creepy son the effete and bothersome george macready before she knows it she awakens to find herself in a seaside manor shes never seen before where witty and macready are calling her marian and trying to convince the servants and the nearby townspeople that shes macreadys mad wife of course this pair can only be planning dastardly deeds and even though we know julia has to eventually escape her trap director joseph lewis builds real suspense in answering the question of just how shell manage itbr br my name is julia ross has nothing stylistically to set it apart from any number of films that came out at the same time period but i was surprised by how well it held together despite its shoestring budget and bmovie pedigree there are quite a few moments that just may have you on the edge of your seat and i found myself really rooting for julia as she caught on to the scheme underfoot and began to outsmart her captors in any other gothic thriller the heroine would have swooned screamed and dithered waiting for her hero to come and save her so i cant tell you how refreshing it was to have the heroine in this film use her brain and figure out how to save herselfbr br well donebr br grade b
2,this was one of the worst movies ever it was so bad i was laughing through the whole movie the plot was so cheesy especially the end this movie turns from an endoftheworlddisaster to savetheeels i mean cmon and i sweari think they use sock puppets for the eels and there was this horrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters who happened to be divorced how predictable it was so terrible that my mom my sister and i couldnt finish it and when we did finish it it was about a year later the second time we watched it and we finished it this time we did mst3klike comments throughout the moviebr br summary only watch this if youre a movie basher make hilarious comments watch this at a sleepover for laughs and i mean huge laughs also watch for mockery the metaphor that explains this movie this movie is a very shallow field full of cheese and sock puppets
2,on the back burner for years so it was reported this television reunion of two of the most beloved characters in sitcom history started off badly  and went straight downhill from there mary richards mary tyler moore and her best friend rhoda morgenstern valerie harper meet in new york after a long estrangement and catch up on each others lives what a novel concept but sad to relate nothing worth talking about let alone making a movie about has happened to either of them in the intervening years so instead the script contents itself with throwing out one hoary old plot device after another most having to do with older women in the workplace while completely missing the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner the supporting cast is instantly forgettable the humor is nonexistent and the chemistry which moore and harper once had together is gone moore allegedly stalled this project for years waiting for just the right script before committing herself if this was the one she considered right what on earth were the ones she turned down like its not the age of the characters that does this in for time inevitably marches on but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with a blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work at one time this was intended as a pilot but all to obviously it failed to generate any interest among potential sponsors or for that matter among potential audiences quickly and mercifully forgotten the film is a travesty and an insult to a classic
2,i had seen lady with red hair back when it appeared and didnt remember it as something to cherish the truth is that notwithstanding its base in a true story its screen play is silly and unbelievable the real merit of the picture is the cast a constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 30s and 40s make a background for the delicate intelligent work of the always underrated miriam hopkins and the wonderful spectacular performance of claude rains who as usual is the best thing in the picture what an actor he never won an oscar but he is in the good company of chaplin garbo and hitchcock perhaps lady with red hair contains his best work in films see it and enjoy himbr br 
7,studio 666 aka the possessed in the uk is another subpar slasher that has the appearance of a straighttodvd moviebr br whilst many of the straighttodvd movies are fastpaced or unintentionally hilarious in the sobaditsgood sense studio 666 is a lamentable failurebr br at the time of writing every comment on the first page includes a negative rating and a negative review every one of these people have hit the nail on the headbr br the two people at the time of writing who wrote comments with a rating of 10 out of 10 should not be taken seriously obviously theyve seen few slasher movies and have an even more limited understanding of horrorbr br the only really positive point i can make about this movie is that it does fare better than the choke and one of them two extremely mediocre slasher movies that i would not wish on my worst enemybr br the plot of this movie must have been done hundreds if not thousands of times the movie only has a slight twist and one that is badly handled to the usual expectations a depressed singer commits suicide soon after her spirit returns to possess one of her surviving friends the said possessed friend goes on a killing spree the rest of the plot really is too bizarre to sum up youll just have to see it for yourself providing your interest has not yet waned to the point of extinction of coursebr br the acting in the movie is very poor for the most part the actress who played dora was an exception to this her character was always interesting and seductive when she was on the screen she helps to elevate the movie above similar contemporary efforts unfortunately some of the lines she was given to say were badly written to put it mildly and thus prevent her from saving the moviebr br the direction was equally poor the villains did not seem the least bit menacing every killing was totally devoid of suspense or tension atmosphere was nonexistent and the camerawork was incredibly basic some of the special effects if you can call them that reminded me of the tv series ghost stories unfortunately for the producers of this movie ghost stories had intelligently written scripts believable performances and made superb use of camera angles maybe if the producers had watched that tv series closely theyd have picked up some more techniques that might have saved this excuse for a moviebr br the music is completely unsuited to the tone of the movie its just rock music and not the best examples of this type either dont get me started on that awful song played at the beginningbr br some aspects of the movie particularly dialogue are unintentionally funny unfortunately they are not funny enough to move the movie up or should it be down to the sobaditsgood levelbr br overall studio 666 is a mundane mediocre slasher with very little noteworthy aspects i recommend this only to those who are fans of straighttodvd movies and have a desire to see every single slasher ever made
1,i saw this movie in the theater when i was a kid and always remember it as my first experience with getting ripped off by a horrible movie with a good commercial the commercial was great but it i found out later that it had every explosion or special effect in the entire movie about and even some that werent in the movie there was some sort of plot relating to the aliens but the aliens were never actually shown in the movie as far as i remember it was clearly a case of someone making a buck off a cheap movie designed to scam people i guess my world of innocence ended that day when i found out there were bad people out there who make bad bad movies
2,whats inexplicable firstly the hatred towards this movie it may not be the greatest movie of all time but gimme a break it got 11 oscars for a reason it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason its a damn good movie which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters ive rewatched it on tv and video and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen twice or maybe three times actually but that might be it the appeal of it its a movie yes capital m there its an epic its a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur now ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama not that titanic has none of that well the acting was actually very good the melodrama was quite heavyhanded at timesbr br but the reason titanic works is that its such an emotional ride i usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind or give me a visual thrill this movie isnt exactly dumb but its not cerebral at all the visual thrills are simply means to an end to fuel the emotions of the audience i didnt cry when bambis mom died i dont react to tearjerkers but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million an emotional rollercoaster that if it were a regular one would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl and im sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it and have a ready supply of cynicism then you can thoroughly dislike this movie but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt youll enjoy it completely and look at the top ten grossing films of all time is a single one of them bad is a single one of them worth a score of out of 10 no not even the phantom menace and this movie made 18 billion dollars worldwide it cant be bad not possible 1010br br ps how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman spiderman was a fun movie but it was a total 911 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did it simply wasnt anything all that special no one will remember it in 50 years but im pretty sure titanic will be remembered
0,i cant believe how anyone can make a comedy about an issue such as homelessness of course brooks has not made a comedy about _real_ homeless people no mention of drugs prostitution or violence on these streets the people we meet in this movie are homeless in fantasy land so the only difference between them and us is that they dont eat quite as often brooks movies have become worse and worse over the years this is just another nail in the coffin 
4,the fine cast cannot uplift this routine tale of a secretary murdered by her married paramour in fact there are more questions than answers in this onesided tale of romance and murder and since we are only provided with the prosecutions side none of these questions will be answered this is the type of fare that appeals to the he woman man hater clubs of america as presented it is the tale of an innocent woman who just happens to be caught up in a romance with a married highprofile attorney is it possible that if she had not been two timing her boy friend and having an affair with a married man the whole nasty murderous sordid incident could have been avoided when you watch this dont worry about going to the fridge you wont miss anything
2,its die hard meets cliffhanger when a ski resort is besieged by terrorists and its up to one cop jack crackerjack to stop thisbr br a baction movie that borrows from other films and is quite good with pretty good action a ridiculous plot as always in these movies and three fine stars thomas ian griffith as the cop and nastasja kinski and christopher plummer as terrorists if you dont like stupid baction movies this is not for you
5,apart from helen bonham carter there is nothing worthy about this movieand the surprise ending the thought of a sequel is even more annoying save your money wait for the video and ignore that too
4,a good cast is appallingly wasted in this slower than molasses and haphazardly connived comedy peter ustinov tries hard here to bring something to life but the result is a dour bore that misses all the right beats that might have made it watchable regardless of the favorable comments here this film is awful badly directed badly edited badly acted badly written you need to sit through a hundred movies to come across one this badbr br the muddled and excruciatingly laggard plot concerns ustinov conning his way into an american insurance company in order to hack their computer and embezzle millions of pounds how he does it is beyond lameness and credibility he just learns his computer skills seemingly overnight by reading some pamphlets and hoodwinks computer expert robert morley into going to south america and stealing his identitybr br as a side plot ustinov romances fellow loner maggie smith who just happens to become his secretary by chance after he gets a flat in her building she ends up sharing scenes that have sexual undertones with bob newhart that go nowhere while ustinov goes about grafting the money bit by bit and trying to keep one step ahead of newhart and karl malden then he marries smith and they fly off to brazil which has become the staple finale of almost every british caper comedy since nuns on the run a fish called wandabr br the surprise twist of an ending is more laughable than everything that came before by the end i was thinking i must be truly off my rocker to stick out drivel like this even a cameo by cesar romero didnt help it one of the most unfunny poorly paced comedies ive ever seen and certainly the worst caper dont waste your time if you love this you need to see better films
3,i like many people saw this film in the theatre when it first came out in 97 it was a below average film at best defiantly not the masterpiece that all these titanic fanboys like to make it out as first off dicaprio is a terrible actor no matter which way you look at it people just like him because of his looks his acting skills essentially consist of saying a lot of cheesy lines and trying to act sexy second the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot girl falls in love with guy ship theyre on sinks lots of crappy love scenes thereafter anyone with an iq above 50 will realize this isnt ingenious in any way whatsoever nor is it original plus the director felt the need to drag it out for hours i could compress it into a hour block without losing any of the plot in conclusion titanic is the most overrated movie to date why it got so much attention and money is beyond me
6,dire just dire the script is contrived the acting painful and the story just drags along it is without a doubt a celebration of sally potter and little else this wouldnt be so bad but shes the director writer and star of the film and so is just selfglorification i found myself not caring about the developing romance between the principal two characters and the ending came not a moment too soon it has two redeeming features first is that a lot of the shots are really quite lovely particularly in paris and look rather good in black and white secondly whether youre a fan of tango or not the music is by and large excellent except where sally starts singing watch this film at your own risk or if you need an unintentional laugh i am sure it appeals to someone statistically it has to
2,the movie was a suspenseful and somewhat dark look at the severe results of a genuinely human mistake connery and fishburne work very well together in this thriller about murder and redemption keep your boots on for the strange turnaround at the end of the movieyoud never expect it
1,never cast models and playboy bunnies in your films bob fosses star 80 about dorothy stratten of whom bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her sister after her murder at the hands of her lowlife husband is a zillion times more interesting than dorothy herself on the silver screen patty hansen is no actress eitheri expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la orson welles but instead got audrey hepburn cavorting in jeans and a godawful poodlesque hairdovery disappointingpaper moon and the last picture show i could watch again and again this clunker i could barely sit through once this movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding ms strattens tawdry death i think the real reason was because it was so bad
6,much of over her dead body is so painfully unfunny that i was actually squirming in my seat out of embarrassment for the actorsbr br eva longoria proves that she cant carry a film in this terrible romantic comedy and further that she doesnt really even have any comedic timing shes grating and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep a cooky psychic from dating her widower fianc the fianc is played by paul rudd drippy and charmless while the psychic is played by lake bell bringing the movie whatever anemic energy it has i felt most sorry for bell as she appears to have some comic abilities and was working overtime in an effort to make the material work unfortunately she is up against the insurmountable task of making any movie that features jason biggs tolerable and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast like leo dicaprio at the end of titanic br br over her dead body actually pied me off because of its laziness and utter lack of effort i started to think of all the interesting projects that cant get funded because vast amounts of money are being funneled into bland crap like this seriously does hollywood think movies like this are good enough how stupid do they really think the moviegoing public is br br grade f
7,the case of the scorpions tail has all the elements that are necessary in order to make an effective giallo movie the story is standard giallo when a man dies in a plane crash his wife ida galli collects a million life insurance policy the widow heads to greece for the payout but a series of gruesome murders follow her there are plenty of suspects including a tenacious investigator george hilton from the insurance agency and the widows lover director martino keeps the story moving at a fast pace while the viewer tries to guess the identity of the killer anita strindberg also memorable in your vice is a locked room and only i have the key and who saw her die is a stunninglooking heroine its one of martinos best films
1,i liked this movie very much because it is a true story set in the amazon a part of the world that always has intrigued me i believe a condensed form of the book was published in readers digest soon after the actual event occurredbr br because i am a baby boomer the character and the actress are my contemporaries and for this reason i related to the film i also believe the movie is valuable for teaching survival skills if the viewer observes the characters following the streams that lead to the river and to the coastal settlements where she can get help as well as other survival techniques most important was her will to survive and to maintain a positive attitude in conclusion i hope viewers learn something from it in addition seeing it for entertainmentbr br i do wish the movie would be released in vhs and dvd soon as i should like to add it to my video collection it also should be shown more often on the satellite movie channels
3,i think that it was just pointless to produce a second part of a movie like my girl my girl was a very good movie but it is ridiculous making a second part of a movie in which one of the main characters macaulay culkin as thomas j dies the story was over after the first movie i wonder why someone tried to find a way to make the story going on that was senseless
3,this is a great ending to the show the fact that adm janeway was able to do a double switch on the borg was great the fact that she allowed herself to be infected thus infecting the queen with a poison that in essence ended the borg was great the way they ended it also left some not a lot for a reunion movie however they did bring them home and the way they did it was fantastic it was sad to say good bye to a part of my family ending it with tom and blanna having their baby just as they enter the alpha quad was a great way to show a new beginning it would be nice to have a reunion movie of some type  just to see where their characters would be today
0,what i liked best in this film is that like the films of hitchcock it is a thriller that does not take itself too seriouslybr br hitchcock understood that people go the the movies to have a good time something that hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years this is a thriller but it has plenty of laughs and always has one eye winking at the camerabr br rachel mcadams is wonderful as always cillian murphy is creepier than he was in batman begins in the old days there were guys who always played the bad guy we dont see much of that these days because i suspect the hollywood agents consider it a bad career move but cillian murphy is really good at being badbr br the directing is surprising stylish the story is good but the dialog could have used some sprucing upbr br red eye is a really fun film and people were applauding when the closing credits started rolling if you are in the mood for an enjoyable escapist thriller red eye might be your ticket

5,i disagree with much that has been written and said about this supposed masterpiece of the german new wave br br there are major flaws in simple exposition in the basic communication of critical plot points as relating to marias abortion and the secret contract between oswald and her husband how many viewers understood that the husband agreed in exchange for substantial financial remuneration not to return to and reclaim his wife until oswald was deadbr br the ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental the original screenplay called for maria to commit suicide after the reading of oswalds will on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to oswald in the final version however maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide maria is then summarily blown up rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her selfdelusion and moral compromisebr br fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private the political on the personal contrary to what the critics and experts assert i dont think it works merely intruding historic radio news or the sound of the jackhammers of german reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama br br the selfish ambition of marias rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the socalled economic miracle of postwar germany maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific women have been asserting their independence by using sex for selfadvancement for ages br br lastly there are several instances of inexcusable sloppiness and amateurishness  fassbinders drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect unknown people talk off screen without ever being seen music is clumsily intrusive in places and melodramatic posturing sporadically substitutes for actingbr br strangely for a movie condemning a country for willful collective amnesia of the holocaust it itself never mentions it once
3,unremittingly bleak and depressing the film evokes as well as could be desired the legendary misery and emptiness that characterised houellebecqs controversial novel of the same name like many french films its manner is one of wistful profundity but it is painfully slow  or should that be slowly painful while this is an excellent and challenging film it is not an enjoyable one and its difficult to think of any time when one might be in the right mood to see it
4,i first saw this movie when i was about 10 years old my mom bought it at our local kmart because it was on sale for on vhs she thought that it would be a nice christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch this movie however scared the hell out of me you may be asking yourself how could a movie about santa clause scare anyone the plot of the movie revolves around satan sending one his minions pitch to earth in an attempt to kill santa and ruin christmas thats right satan sends a demon up from hell to kill santa clause pitch stalks santa throughout christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on christmas day for if santa doesnt make it back to his home in space he turns to powder dont get me wrong the movie is funny and fairly entertaining however the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell which occurs at the beginning of the movie is just downright creepy
1,if i hadnt been forced to watch this for work reasons i never would have made it past the first 10 minutes and even then i admit i fast forwarded through parts the 63 film version was vastly superior in all regards yes ive read this one is more faithful to the original play but what a wise thing it was for the writer to change the script in 63 its overlong it drags the songs that are in this version and not in the film version are boring and unimaginative the version of kids in the 63 version was very funny and a true classic of sarcastic parent humor in this version the kim is way too old the conrad is absolutely horrible to behold when someone ripped his shirt off him i shuttered in disgustthe director of this version has no idea what sexy is this conrad cant dance cant sing he cant even stay in tune and is simply repulsive if elvis presley had really been like that his career would have been over before it began as for the other actors well i kept waiting for alexanders toupee to fall off as he danced and daly was totally over acting as momma see stapletons performance in the film version to see the same role properly executed by someone who understands comic timing this tv version is nothing but a total waste of anyones time
6,near the beginning of the godfather part iii michael corleones son wants to drop out of law school and become a musician michael corleone does not want this but his estranged exwife kay manages to convince him to let anthony corleone pursue music as he wishes so he doesbr br that seems like an odd way to start a review as it is a minor plot point and has nothing really to do with the major action just bear with me here youll see where im going with this eventually now let me tell you about the major plot it is about michael corleone wanting to quit crime for good he has largely abandoned all criminal elements in his family business but then along comes vincent mancini an illegitimate nephew who is involved in a feud so of course michael must endure yet another brush with criminality and gun violence and all that good gangster stuff meanwhile vincent has a semiincestuous affair with michaels daughter mary oh and michael and kay are trying to patch up all the horrid things that happened at the end of part iibr br it is like a soap opera one horrid awful 169minute soap opera gone is any sort of the sophistication romance and emotional relevance that made the first two movies hit home so hard after a 16year break in the franchise francis ford coppola delivered a mess of sop and pretentiousness entirely incongruous with the first two films once again proving his last great work was apocalypse now back in the 1970sbr br whats worse the godfather part iii isnt even a logical followup of the godfather part ii michael is a completely different person he hasnt just gone to seed which might be legitimate even if itd be no fun to watch hes become a goodygoody thats trying to fix all the tragedy that made part ii such a devastating masterpiece his confession to the priest was bad enough but that little diabetes attack in the middle pushed it over to nauseating he also gets back together with kay for heavens sakes there is absolutely no way that should happen as the 2nd movie made abundantly clear she aborted his baby and his sicilian upbringing made him despise her for it didnt francis ford coppola even think of these thingsbr br and dont even get me started on mary and vincents affair for a romance so forbidden it was shockingly unengaging sofia coppolas acting did nothing to help she made the smartest move of her life when she switched from in front of the camera to behind it because she was possibly the worst actress i have ever seen in a best picture nominee every line she delivered was painfully memorized and every time the drama rested on her acting abilities all she elicited was inappropriate giggles in the climactic scenei wont go into detail but youll know which scene im talking about whenif you watch itshe looks at michael and says daddy i think i was meant to cry but the line was delivered so poorly i burst out into long loud laughterbr br now we get to the climax and now you will also realize why i took time to start the review with a description of anthony corleones musical ambitions after 140 minutes of petty drama and irrelevant happenstances anthony corleone returns with an opera so michael kay mary and vincent go to see it and for about 1015 minutes a couple killers walk around trying to assassinate michael about this climactic sequence i must say one thing it was really good but not because of the killersthey were pretty boring i just really liked the opera it had some great music and real great set pieces and from what little it showed us it seemed that the story had echoes of the corleone familys origin ill bet it was one swell opera and ill bet michael corleone was glad he let his son switch from law school to musicbr br my biggest wish is this that francis ford coppola had merely filmed anthony corleones opera for 169 minutes and ditched the rest of the soggy melodrama better yet i wish he hadnt made the godfather part iii at all part ii gave us the perfect ending this spin off was selfindulgent and unnecessarybr br ps this is not a gut reaction to the film i watched all godfather films over a month ago though i was rewatching the first one not only does this mean that my expectations for part iii werent screwed in fact i had set the bar rather low for it after what i heard but it also means ive had a good time to think about all three films while i was a bit disappointed with part ii at first the more i thought about it the better it seemed but with part iii it was bad to begin with then got worse the more i thought about it the sad thing is that many people will stop with part i but if they watch part ii as well they will most likely go on to part iii if you have the will watch parts i  ii and pretend like part iii never existed
7,this is without a doubt the greatest film ever made it is nearly incomprehensible even with many repeated viewings in an attempt to figure out what exactlys going on the film was almost entirely improvised and includes random musical numbers commercials contests one enters by mail and a host of other innovations besides what other movies have cameos by martin luther king jr to decipher the film hunt down the directors book entitled i was curious itll all become clear its a grand and bold experiment in improvised recursive filmmaking a triumph now if only someone would put out a version with the subtitles in a color other than whitethe white subtitles tend to wash out and become invisible
6,it was hard to watch this film and be totally fair and objective since i am a big fan the original 1944 movie that to me and many others is one of the greatest film noirs ever made realizing this is simply a shortened madefortv film and that most people had trashed it i didnt expect much but you cant help but compare this with the 44 film scene after scene i found myself comparing what i was looking at it and remembering how it played out with fred macmurray barbara stanwyck edward g robinson and others now i was seeing these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by richard crenna samantha eggar and lee j cobbbr br when it was all over i found it wasnt as bad as i had expected but its no match for the 1944 original the two main areas in which this madefortv film wasnt as good were the electricity between the two leads was missing and being only 90 minutes they rushed the story with hardly time to develop the plot characters and chemistry between those leads crenna and eggar were flat and simply no match for macmurray and stanwyck as walter neff and phyllis dietrichson respectivelybr br where this remake held its own was in the other characters such as barton keyes and edward norton cobb was terrific as keyes and robert webber as norton head of the insurance company it also was somewhat interesting to see the time frame changed so the houses cars telephones dictating machines etc were all early 70s instead of mid 40s otherwise the storyline was very similar just rushedbr br however one viewing was enough and i will happily go back to the original version for the rest of my viewings of this classic story and film
6,well awful is just the first name this movie is a clichridden piece of junk a high school comedy setup in a military training camp im sorry i had to give this star which it did not deservebr br this may contain spoilersbr br just about everything is totally forced unconvincing and unrealistic the hepo military police will not come to get you if you dont make your appearance especially not on your wedding day the actors were pretty embarrassed during this scene because the scene didnt work as it was so highly unlikely you can sense it in their voices even if they were not such bad actors they wouldnt have been able to save the scene br br next the guy has to exercise in his wedding suit no there was no time to get him an uniform first man this is great cinematography i will remember this scene for the rest of my lifebr br there are also girls in the campexcitingone ofem even a model though not looking that greatand the baddest actress ive ever seen i doubt in hollywood they would let her say a single line in a b movie br br okay girls in the military now this is getting fun the girls are even placed on the same floor so we can sneak to their room at night in reality they would be placed in a different building a quarter mile away separated by two fences with barbed wire br br there are tanks available we can use for a fun ride in our spare time of which we have plenty no the tanks are not locked and the ignition keys are inserted no one will notice the engine sounds especially not at nightbr br there is a bunch of sex scenes and references and all are below the waste line we need those so the sexually obsessed germans will like the movie as well switzerland is too small a market for any feature film well donebr br one sex scene takes place in the kitchen surely none of those facilities are ever locked the military routines are as sloppy as they can getbr br in the end of the brainless flick the mafia hit men are about the take revenge on the poor guy trying to shoot him because he deserted his fiance sure i buy that the italians are that waya jealous bunch not br br the bad guys attempt to do this in open daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses not at night in a dark alley again military training grounds where there is shooting with live ammo are open to the public anyone can freely drive or walk in there there are no such things as guards or fences br br the deed however is prevented by the good captain timely launching a rocket into the italians car the explosion knocks the hit men and the enraged fiance off their feet no one in 40 feet distance is hurt when the car is blown to smithereens its a comedy rememberbr br okay its a comedy i got that and i can live with that no realism needed filmmakers can easily get way with this if it is hilariously side splitting funny or entertaining interesting challenging unfortunately it is none of those its just embarrassing a ripoff from brainless american comedies the latter are at least done professionally with no amateur actorsbr br it is pretty boring and predictable a waste of time and energy especially to those sitting through the entire movie as i unfortunately did yawn
1,i saw the mst3k version of deathstalker iii and loved the movie so much  even unmystied  that i decided to watch the entire series of deathstalker films i bought i and ii and settled down for a laughbr br nothing about deathstalker i was funny on any level and when the credits rolled i was embarrassed and regretful that i had bought it too much ugliness and nudity i guess either ds was a much cleaner production or mst3k really edited a lot because i expected something similar ie stupid and carefree and simple i was wrong even at 699 it seemed a waste of money i didnt even open ds as i will return it tomorrow now ill probably just throw away this dvd as i cant return it and no one wants it  including myself so really dont bother with this one even the nudity lots of it btw is uninspiring and icky
6,as big as a texas prairie and equally as boring even liz taylor james dean chill wills and dennis hopper cant float this overbloated boat taylor actually looks badwrong wardrobe wrong hair and wrong makeupa unique accomplishment in her remarkable career hopper gives the only believable performance and dean in the climactic scene displays remarkable talent as something we usually dont remember him fora comic actor rock hudson is his usual prototype of barbie doll ken and makes one wonder what a say redford could have done with the male lead there is no discernible plot that provides any tension until the final twenty minutes just a pastiche of milestones that have little relationship to each other except for hopper there is no character development only a collection of cardboard cutouts that pop up periodically for no discernible reason like random targets in a shooting gallery to its credit the film does tackle racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo subjects and it does have size making it an excellent choice for ridding yourself of unwelcome house guests those with the dvd version can spare themselves some of the tedium by starting with the second disk you wont be missing anything of interest
0,the premise of the movie has been explained and if youve gotten this far you dont me to pretend that im a movie critic with that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low im a fan of takashi miike but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with doa and and some others manybr br the movie seems to get a free pass because it is a takashi film and nothing takashi does can be wrong this is a highschoolers approach to cinema for the rest of us well find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying and yes this does take away from the film the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis and the actingwellhmmm br br if one is a takashi fan youll see it regardless to peak your interests it lacks any originality see the neverending story or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one br br as it has been pointed out this is the first film miike has been credited with cowriting but that doesnt mean much as non of what wed hope would be miikes personality would spill over into the screen all we get are some of the token miike shots vis the director of photographybr br the movie had the potential to be something great the premise is not a difficult one to run wild with but this one seemed to have been run into the groundbr br my suggestion is if youre just getting into miike is go with some of the standards like gozu ichi and audition then movie into his works like blues harp fudoh rainy dog bird people of china
0,show people is an absolutely delightful silent directed by king vidor and starring marion davies and billy haines what gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl peggy pepper whose acting is the talk of savannah trying to make it on the big screen though shes a success in comedy what she wants to do is make art so she moves up to high arts studio soon she becomes patricia pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend billybr br many stars of the silent era have cameos in show people including davies herself without the curly hair and makeup im sure when people saw the film in 1928 they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene sadly nowadays its not the case even for film buffs in one part of the film however she does meet charlie chaplin in another author elinor glyn is pointed out to her and vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film other stars who pop up in show people are john gilbert douglas fairbanks william s hart leatrice joy bess flowers renee adoree rod laroque aileen pringle and many othersbr br davies was adorable and a lively comedienne its a shame william haines quit the movies  he was cute and energetic deservedly an enormous star back in the daybr br show people is a simple story told in a witty way its also a look back at an exciting era in hollywoods history and contains performances by two wonderful stars

5,movie comedies nowadays are generally 100 minutes of toilet humor foul language and groinkicking modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator the undemanding and slow of brain sure an occasional good comedy will come along but theyre becoming rarer all the timebr br mr blandings buildings his dream house shows what 1940s hollywood was capable of and its just screamingly funny jim and muriel blandings cary grant and myrna loy decide to build a house in the connecticut suburbs the film follows their story beginning with house hunting trips the houses riotous construction all the way to the finished homewith its zuzzzuzz water softenerbr br grant and loy are perfect for their roles of course grant is particularly funny as he watches the houses costs zoom out of control however the film is stolen by the blandings wise attorney played to perfection by melvyn douglas managing to steal every scene hes in douglas is understatedly hilarious while he watches the blandings lurch from crisis to crisis reginald denny as the blandings harried architect and harry shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderfulbr br ive watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh i think its a good film to watch when you need a lift whether youre building a house or not
3,yes this gets the full ten stars its plain as day that this fill is genius the universe sent trent harris a young wonderfully strange man one day and harris caught him on tape in all that true misfit glory that you just cant fake too bad it ended in tragedy for the young man if only an alternate ending could be written for that fellows story the other two steps in the trilogy do retell the story with sean penn and crispin glover in the roles of the young men respectively the world is expanded upon and the strangeness is contextualized by the retelling giving us a broader glimpse into growing up weird in vanilla america recommended for anyone and everyone
5,ok so it was written in 1996 before 911 so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world is prescient thats it thats the good stuff the actingfair the plotsilly the twist unnecessary dooooooooooom it isnt as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated dont you think bureaucrats have a manual for plagues and how to contain them proper execution of such a plan is always a problem as we saw after katrina but they have a plan it isnt to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania and if the virus is carried in the air why was the plane door open and the shooters standing there with no protection in fact did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs that would stop her but not as dramatic im a sucker i always watch a movie to see the end once i started it but this was a waste of time and for the most part predictable i saw it using a recorder so i didnt have to watch all the ads that was a plus its a good example of why i watch so little network tv rubbish
0,this is the best emma in existence in my opinion having seen the other version 1996 which is also good and read the book i think i can safely say with confidence that this is the true interpretation and is the most faithful to jane austens masterpiece the 1996 movie with g paltrow is good too its just that its almost like a different story altogether its very light and fluffy you dont see the darker edges of the characters and if you just want a pleasant movie that one would do fine but the intricacies of some of the plot points such as the churchillfairfax entanglement is so much glossed over as to be virtually nonexistent but if you want the characters fleshed out a bit more real and multidimensional the 1996 tv version is the superior emma is a remarkable person but she is flawed kate beckinsale is masterful at showing the little quirks of the character you see her look casually disgusted at some of the more simple conversation of harriet smith yet she shows no remorse for having ruined harriets proposal until that action has the effect of ruining her own marital happiness at the ending you see her narcissism and it mirrors frank churchills in that they would do harm to others to achieve their own aims for emma it was playing matchmaker and having a new friend to while away the time with after having suffered the loss of her governess to marriage for frank churchill it is securing the promise of the woman he loves while treating her and others abominably to keep the secret in the book she realizes all of this in a crushing awakening to all the blunders she has made both kate beckinsale and gyneth paltrow are convincing in their remorse but paltrows is more childlike and stagnant while beckinsales awakening is rather real and serious and you see the transition from childlike selfish behavior to kind and thoughtful adult both versions are very good but i prefer this one
0,once when i was in college and we had an international fair the russian section had a sovietera poster saying ne boltay meaning dont gossip i translated it for the generation of tv watchers as dont be gladys kravitz in reference to the nosy neighbor on bewitchedbr br however when you see the result of gossip in the pvt snafu short rumors you see that its not quite a laughing matter in this case the perpetually witless soldier overhears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the axis powers have attacked the united states so he tells it to someone who tells someone else who tells someone else and it continues as in the russians are coming the russians are coming the story gets blown more and more out of proportion each time so that when it gets back to snafuwell you know what i mean yes its mostly wwii propaganda  complete with a derogatory term for the japanese  but i have to say that the pvt snafu shorts were actually quite funny of course since they had dr seuss writing and mel blanc providing the voices its no surprise that these came out rather cool worth seeing
0,1st watched 1262009  out of 10 dirwalter lang disappointing musical from a character development standpoint in my opinion from this muchheralded rodgers and hammerstein piece there a couple of good songs and a decent comical portrayal at times of the king of siam by yul brynner  but the movie doesnt really do a good job of presenting the situation and the settings i can only blame the screenplay and possibly some of the acting as to why we dont fully understand the characters and their situations i know it might be a little too much to ask of a musical meant for the enjoyment of the songs and the dancing but even this part didnt stand out a lot for me the basic storyline is about an english woman coming to siam to teach the children about upscale european things we find out later that the king is actually the biggest pupil there is a side forbidden romance between the kings newest wife played by rita morenoa latino as an arabcome on and a former lover that causes some complications but nothing really mesmerizing added though deborah kerr as the main female character annie  is ok but not that convincing either the king learns some things because of her presence and then the movie fades away as he does this is really a miniscule story with some songs and dancing but not that great of an experience for a viewer really
0,this film is about a man who has been too caught up with the accepted convention of success trying to be ever upwardly mobile working hard so that he could be proud of owning his own home he assumes this is all there is to life until he accidentally takes up dancing all because he wanted to get a closer look of a beautiful girl that he sees by the dance studio everyday while riding the subway on his way homebr br his was infatuated with her at first going to the dance class just to idolize her but he eventually lets himself go and gets himself into the dancing it eventually becomes apparent to him that there is more to life than working yourself to death there is a set of oddball characters also learning in the studio giving the film a lot of laughs and some sense of bonding between the dejectedbr br there is also revelations of various characters including the girl he initially admired giving some depth to them by showing their blemished past and their struggle to overcome itbr br the dancing was also engaging with the big competition at the end but it is not the usual story where our underdog come out at the top by winning it instead there are downfalls revelations and redemptionbr br all these makes it a moving and fun film to watch
0,as usual sean connery does a great job lawrence fishburn is good but i have a hard time not seeing him as ike turner
0,if you are looking for a film the portrays the pointless and boring existence of middle class lives caught in a web of noncommunication and false ideals then this is the film for you if you also what the film to be engaging and keep your interest then you should probably look elsewhere there are many films that do this far better for example try some of the darker films by bergman the filmmaker felt that in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class he should subject the viewer to one agonizingly dull and vacuous incident after another until the film finally comes to its tortuous and pathetic end if you value your time there are far better ways to spend two hours like cleaning your house for example
0,dont get me wrong  i love david suchet as poirot i love the series as well as the movies but enough already re death on the nile everyone has done this one we know who dies we know why they die we know who the killer is we know how it was done so i say enough already mr suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of agatha christies novels i will say that the acting by all the actors was superb the sets were terrific and very realistic i especially liked david soul but i was surprised at how awful he looked i hope he doesnt look that way in real life i honestly cant remember from other movies whether the very end was the same somehow i dont think so i thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not ms christie wrote it that way i would much rather have that ending then wasting away in prison
0,this movie is the perfect illustration of how not to make a sci fi movie the worst tendency in scifi is to make your theme an awful sophomoric pseudoorwellianhuxleyanwhateverian vision of the human futurebr br science fiction filmmakers and authors as geeks take themselves very seriously given the high craptogoodstuff ratio of their genre i think other genres with a high ctgsr yes i just made it up relax like horror or action or even romantic comedy seem to have a little better grasp of the fact that they are not changing the world with some profound messagebr br sci fi can certainly be successful on a serious level as numerous great filmmakers have proven but there is an immense downside to the whole concept which is represented by robot jox with its lowrent construction of the future lone good design element the bizarre slicklooking billboard ads all over the place that encourage women to have more babies and its painfully heavyhanded iliad parallels hes named achilles for gods sake i actually didnt pick up on this until i saw the film for like the tenth time but i went to public school so the filmmakers are not exoneratedbr br of course if youre a crazy movie freak like me this downside has a great upside i absolutely love movies like this because bad movies are quite often more fun and sometimes even more interesting than good ones its kind of a lester bangs approach to movie viewing i guessbr br note the lead in this movie gary graham is that his name i refuse to go check is really not that bad he makes a go of it hes kind of cool especially when hes drunkhung over
7,this is a very good movie do you want to know the real reasons why so many here are knocking this movie i will tell you in this movie you have a black criminal who outwits a white professor a black cop who tells the white professor he is wrong for defending the black criminal and the black cop turns out to be right thus making the white professor look stupid it always comes down to race this is an excellent movie pay no attention to the racist if you can get over that there are characters who are played by blacks in this movie who outsmart the white characters then you shouldnt have any problems enjoying this movie i recommended everyone to go see this movie

3,this is an interesting left turn for reel 13 indies two harbors is a bw 75 minute film from minnesota that features nonactors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life i applaud the boldness of the reel 13 programmers of thinking outofthebox when selecting this film i just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with as a matter of fact i wonder if the choice had more to do with the uniqueness of the film than with the actual quality of the film itself not that two harbors is completely without merit but ill get to that a little later br br as is common with independent films two harbors is limited in terms of location there are only two real locations  a large junk dealership market and a very teeny trailer which is the home of the middleaged main character vic played by alex cole writerdirector james vculek uses the market setting to provide exposition about vic who is one of the dealers there he has various people walk up to vic and start very long conversations that provides us with just two pieces of information  vic sells space toys he prefers to call them outer space action figures and he is a caustic asshole this is emblematic of one of the two key problems with two harbors  all the chatting ive said it before and ill say it again  we are dealing with a visual medium and filmmakers need to work harder to tell their stories visually there are exceptions of course but generally endless patter is not so engaging on film  particularly if the dialogue is being used as exposition pretty much all the conversations in the film are long and unnecessarily verbose a notable example would be a few scenes which feature vic trying to play himself off as a boy scout leader in order to get a discount at a store he argues with the clerk back and forth and these scenes dont even advance the plot one iota this is the kind of thing that makes even a 75 minute film feel longbr br the other problem with two harbors is the acting i may be a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to performance in film but i really dont feel like theres a good excuse for not having good actors in your films there are plenty of good actors out there many of which willing to work on lowbudget projects  even in minnesota many filmmakers eschew the importance of acting ability as being secondary to their visuals but that is nave in narrative filmmaking next to the story nothing is more important than the actingperformances if you dont believe the people enacting your story your audience is lostbr br originally i thought vculek was using nonactors but as the film went on i decided that they were probably community theatertype actors it wasnt that they were uncomfortable on camera its that they were overly theatrical ie big granted the best of the actors were the two leads  cole and catherine e johnson as cassie a lonely young girl that gets caught up in vics extraterrestrial hunt they seemed to have the most training but they were still a little rough around the edges the eccentricities they displayed seemed to be surface only  not coming from a real organic place within ms johnson in particular is an interesting case she definitely has a presence  a midwestern charm about her but that charisma belies the multitude of issues her character is supposed to have she struggles to portray the idiosyncrasies that stem from a supposed life of solitude and slave labor relying on stock gestures like eye rolls lip biting and stammering to suggest her discomfort with the outside worldbr br i mentioned in the first paragraph that two harbors is not completely without merit and heres what i mean without giving too much away there is a fade to white an hour into the film after that the story takes a stunning turn which allows the last fifteen minutes to be evocative and downright powerful  its like a sucker punch to the gut but in a good way its almost a huge relief to feel something after so long with these characters the last five minutes of the film dont have any dialogue at all and the result is the best part of the film  subtle detailed cole does his best work of the film and most importantly cinematic then with the closing credits comes the most staggering revelation of all  that its based on a true story which got me to thinking with all the dialogue the minimal locations and the lack of cinematic qualities it occurred to me that with two kick ass actors and a tightening rewrite two harbors might make a really kickass stage play  maybe even a oneact if there are any bold theater producers out there reading this i definitely recommend seeing if you can get a hold of the film and contact the filmmaker reel 13 or whomever there might be something to this story after allbr br for more information on this or any other reel 13 film check out their website at wwwreel13org

0,having read another review i thought this movie would actually be good i do enjoy the b movies but this couldnt even be classed as such the photography is probably the only halfway decent thing in the movie but the editing left much to be desired it was very choppy and staccato whoever chose the music and sound did a terrible job the music was awful specially anything atmospheric or scene setting if the acting had been better they could have pulled the movie off unfortunately ive seen better acting in porn flicks if you want to see a b vampire movie check out blood ties youll be much more entertained
0,amazing movie that in theory should be boring but is delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that i have long despaired of ever finding instead of relying on clichs and overly dramatized moments the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments the lead characters are not perfect and so relating to them as people you could know is easy the movie is not trying to pull laughs or push an ideal onto the audience but simply showing us the possibility of true love in any circumstance br br i am now restless waiting for the weekend so i can see the sequel a moving thought provoking funny look at love that i think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with casablanca and breakfast at tiffanys will soften even the hardiest heart
6,this is one of the best comedy ever  the writing of this parody of soap is brilliant and the cast well just look at the names of the cast and youll understand why it is so great if youre a kevin kline fan he does as always an fantastic performance and robert downey jr is perfect if you dont laugh while seen this movie you dont have any sense of humor
0,well what i can say about this movie is that its great to see so many asian faces what i didnt like about the film was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role the asian girl without confidence who has to play someone else to get ahead the white guy infatuated with asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind for the land of yellow and the keeping it real black cab driver plus all the coke shanghai tang and dunkin donuts product placement was a bit too obvious the story plot itself was fun but pretty much how i thought the story would unravel then again when watching romantic comedies you cant expect much but then again i would have been wanted to just be surprised at least once the parents are the best part of the flick

7,im sure that the folks on the texaslouisiana border must have had a a good laugh or two when paramounts b picture unit inflicted this one on the war time public very simply the area along the sabine river where the film opens is cotton country just like the rest of the deep south or at least the deep south was post civl war no big cattle empires there theyre much farther west in texas farther than richard dix and preston foster could ride to set up their empirebr br the film begins with the two of them partners in a riverboat and when leo carrillo tries a theft of their services by not paying them for hauling his cattle they keep the cattle and thats the beginning of the big ponderosa like ranch they startbr br along the way foster marries dixs sister played by frances gifford and feuds with his much smaller neighbors they also have some further run ins with leo carrillobr br anyway us easterners who like westerns usually dont bother with geographical trifles and its still a good western from the production mill of harry sherman who produced all those hopalong cassidy westerns for paramount the climax is a blazing and i mean that literally gun battle that should have maybe been used on an a productionbr br but i wouldnt have any but western fans look at it
3,after reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews i decided that i would add my ten cents worth to say i thought the film was excellent not only in the visual beauty the writing music score acting and directing but in putting across the story of joseph smith and the road he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in god the way he felt and knew to be his path i am very pleased indeed to have had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man i recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself no matter what religious path he or she may be walking this only instills one with more determination to live the life that we should with true values of love and forgiveness as the savior taught us to do
3,it takes a little while to get used to nick noltes nebraskan locutions before we can easily accept him as a famous intercontinental playwright once you get past the bar it turns into a fascinating story of a man who loses everything while trying to do goodbr br nolte an american moves to germany marries a famous actress and is a satisfied success in every respect until war is about to break out hes visited by a jovial american john goodman who persuades him to accept a post as an antisemitic radio broadcaster for the nazis nolte has no politics but thinks its a challenge to write a role thats almost impossible and then play it himself another american secret agent will modify noltes radio scripts  inserting a cough here a sneeze there  that will serve as a code for the transmission of intelligence to the allies theres a catch though nobody will know about noltes real role as an american agent except goodman donovan and roosevelt himself if hes ever uncovered hell be refused recognition by the americansbr br nolte plunges ahead and his vicious broadcasts are wildly popular in germany his adored wife sheryl lee knows nothing of whats going on nor does she care nolte and lee live in what he repeatedly refers to as a nation of two the war ends and the trouble begins hes captured by americans who are bitter because of his betrayal they beat him and leave him in the mud hes rescued by goodman his fairy godmother who sends him to an anonymous existence in greenwich village and sends him a little cash now and thenbr br by 1960 he manages to cultivate a friendship with his neighbor the painter alan arkin who has also lost his family and claims the two now belong to a secret brotherhood but his location and his identity somehow leak out and he is more or less adopted by a group of ancient aryan racists  led by a dentist and a priest his house front and mailbox are painted with swastikas and accusations hes beaten senseless by an exgi but  miraculously  his beloved wife is returned to him by the ancient aryans another catch it turns out later that its not his wife but rather her younger sister who has loved him since adolescencebr br the ending has him typing his memoirs in an israeli jail in 1967 before his trial for crimes against humanity its not a happy endingbr br nolte can talk with but not see the occupant of the cell above his in jail its adolf eichmann eichmann seems pleasant enough he advises nolte that its a bad habit to type for fifteen straight hours its important to relax you must learn to relax nolte laughs out loud and shouts thats how i got here the film is filled with such ironies at one point in their relaxed conversations arkin tells him that in spite of everything i still think people are good at heart i dont know if the movie was a commercial success but if it wasnt thats the sort of thing that might have torpedoed it for a younger audience of theatergoers who may never have heard of anne frank let alone that supposedly final statement in her diarybr br the fact is that its a movie for adults and patient adults at that the story moves slowly theres very little violence no car chases no shootings and people dont seem subject to manic speech pressure a lot of it will probably slip past viewers who dont open themselves to its deliberate approach nolte refers to the wartime relationship between him and his wife as a nation of two this is a pretty compact phrase no doubt anyone could come up with a glib definition but it takes a little concentration to grasp its emotional importbr br its a story of a man who loses everything  his ability to write his identity his wife twice his sole friend his country his self respect at one point he stops walking along a crowded new york street and simply stands there until after dark when he is moved along by a curious cop the reason he stopped is that he simply has no place to go what vonnegut is describing is far more than depression i dont mean to sound condescending but its the sort of feeling thats hard to understand in your youth adolescents might like to think they know whats holding nolte in that one spot but it really requires maturity and the quickened sense of finiteness that only maturity can bringbr br remember robert frosts line about home being the place that when you go there they have to take you in well no place will take nolte in
2,2003 was seen as the year of the matrix with the release of two sequels and a computer game that actually linked to the plot of the film also released was a dvd of short animated films most written and made in japan and made as anime japan makes some of the best animation in the world sadly most of these shorts are disappointing the best of them is the first part of a prequel to the first matrix filmbr br the second renaissance is made as a historical file it tells how humans made machines in their own likeness humans live the high life whilst machines are the grunts the workers of society second class citizens in the year 2090 a machine bi66er was put of trial for murder after killing his owners who wanted to deactivate him the machine does not have a fair trial and riots start around the world the governments of the world order to dismantle machines many machines leave human society and form their own country in the middle east o1 01 has a productive economy and easily undercut the human nations forcing them into economic crisis the human blockade 01 and reject the machines requests for peace thereby it was the humans who were responsible for the war that enslaves thembr br the second renaissance is a interesting watch with excellent traditional animation style and sets a compelling world it shows how the machines were mistreated and that humanity sowed the seeds of their own destruction there is a political and social world and the short tells a lot in it short running time the short shares themes and a style to the classic silent film metropolis partly the beginning with the underworld they are the themes of slavery the mistreatment of the working class and racism the short also has some religious themes and religious iconography mainly that men saw themselves as god and created the machines in their own likeness seeing themselves as the rightful masters of the machines the machines too use religious iconography mainly forming their nation in cradle of human civilisation and the machines coming to the united nations dressed as adam and eve offering an applebr br the animation style is beautiful done in the traditional anime style like akira the set designs are great combine futuristic with historic cities eg washington dc there is well down future scene and surprising violence which is key to the film the director mahiro maeda also directed the anime sequence in kill bill vol so has good credentials to hollywood he is willing to use violence and know how to keep a story goingbr br the only real complain is a continuity error to the first matrix film because morpheus mentions that the humans have no historical records or know who started the war but its a good watch
0,the japanese run lola run his is one offbeat movie which will put a smile on just about anyones face fans of run lola run tampopo go and slacker will probably like this one it does tend to follow a formula that is increasingly popular these days of separate seemingly unrelated vignettes all contributing the the overall story in unexpected ways catch it if you see it otherwise wait for the rental
7,when i first saw a glimpse of this movie i quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of lucille ball rachel yorks portrayal of lucy is absolutely awful lucille ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent to think about a legend like lucille ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous i cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better lucy the producers decided to get rachel york she might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of lucille ball is tough it is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble lucille ball but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent if you noticed yorks portrayal of lucy in episodes of i love lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin nothing is similar in any wayher expression voice or movementbr br to top it all off danny pino playing desi arnaz is horrible pino does not qualify to play as ricky hes small and skinny his accent is unreal and once again his acting is unbelievable although fred and ethel were not similar either they were not as bad as the characters of lucy and rickybr br overall extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told if people want to understand the real life situation of lucille ball i suggest watching ae biography of lucy and desi read the book from lucille ball herself or pbs american masters finding lucy if you want to see a docudrama before the laughter would be a better choice the casting of lucille ball and desi arnaz in before the laughter is much better compared to this at least a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing
6,a surprisingly complex and well crafted study of the first serial killer in the ussr set in the days of perestroika this intense piece is brought to full life with the performances of stephen reah and donald sutherlandbr br this examination of cicatillo as a killer is well rounded and by hinting at some of his behaviors while out right showing others there is a subtlety that is compelling without being overtly graphic not for the weak of heart however as its subject matter is often disturbing but necessary to its full development of the main participants in this fact based storybr br hbo has furnished us with an excellent film in an unusual manner congrats to the director and editor of this great piece it is in my top 10 must see list
4,it was disgusting and painful what a waste of a cast i swear the audience 12 full laughed twice in 90 minutes this is not a lie do not even rent itbr br zeta jones was just too mean to be believablebr br cusack was ok just ok i felt sorry for him the actor in case people remember this messbr br roberts was the same as she always is charming and sweet but with no purpose the romance with john was completely unbelievable
0,reese witherspoon first outing on the big screen was a memorable one she appears like a fresh scrubbed face tween slight and stringy but undeniably reesebr br i have always liked her as an actor and had no idea she started this young with her career go figure i actually gained some respect for reese to know who she was so early on i say that because whenever i have watched her perform the characters thus far in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character quite nicely in factbr br anyway my first film experience with reese was the little red riding hood parody reese did with kiefer sutherland somehow i assumed that was her first time up at bat not so well done reese
0,in the movie several references are made in subtly to blade runner but one of the most obvious is the fact the cain 607 and his unit are all genetic constructs breed to be expendable warriors but as favorite quote of mine from the movie is  you should have made them smart as well as fast kurt russell did a incredible job his facial expressions or lack of in the movies gave more in the way of relating the story then the rest of the cast combined even when he falls in love with sandra but does not know how to deal with these emotions and his tears after being expelled from the group or his shuddering when he is given a hug and his attachment to the mute young boy who in many ways reminded todd of himself and what he could have been if not for his selection to be a soldier
1,this hardhitting often violent western in the peckinpahleone tradition is surprisingly directed by andrew v mclaglen whose previous westerns particularly those that starred john wayne were mainly in the john ford mode it is both surprisingly traditional good guysbad guys and incredible uptodate as wellbr br heston portrays a former captain of the arizona territorial police who has been in retirement for a year having turned over the law enforcement reins to a reformminded sheriff michael parks and finding his ways of enforcing the law being taken over by autos telegraphs telephones and the railroad in the first years of the 20th century but soon he is confronted with a menace from his pasta halfbreed outlaw coburn that he put away more than a decade before for a train robbery that killed four guards in a subsequent shootout coburns wife was killed and so coburn is out for a most nasty sort of revenge it involves the kidnapping and eventually the rape of hestons daughter hershey by him and his gang the result is a taut and violent pursuit through the mountains and deserts of southern arizonabr br the last hard men based on brian garfields novel gun down is violent in many places including the showdown between heston and coburn and the rape scene involving hershey and two members of coburns gang quade paull is probably every bit as questionable as similar scenes in straw dogs and deliverance but that doesnt detract too terribly much from the films psychological approach to the western genre mclaglen is able to handle the bloody story with significant panache and hestons performance as an aging lawman was probably the best one he ever gave in any of his 1970s films coburn makes for an especially coldblooded heavy and both parks and chris mitchum as hersheys intended husband do good turns as well the music here is cribbed from jerry goldsmiths scores to 100 rifles and the 1966 remake of stagecoach but it still works herebr br wisely filmed totally on location in southeastern arizona and utilizing the old tucson set the last hard men needs to be released by fox on vhs andor dvd soon it is a western that deserves nothing less
7,probably the worst bollywood film ive seenbr br no plot line very little character developmentsbr br full of silly and pointless humor the whole film was chaotic and directionless there was no proper ending to the story the airport was filmed in a shopping mall br br same story chewed over and over again until you want to say please just move on with it even the song and dance was pointless and badly choreographedbr br the only good thing about this movie is that there were hot bods all around but then most of the bollywood movies have that anyways these daysbr br btw im not from an indian backgroundbr br 210
0,i hate to sound like an old person but frankly i havent seen too many movies that i like that were made after 1960 generally movies just seem to get worse and worse although i quite enjoyed the scott baio vehicle the bread my sweet except for the de rigeur sex scene which added nothing of value to that movie this movie makes the mother a former las vegas chorus girl seem to be incapable of surviving on her own although she is clearly in her 50s though hinted at being in her 40s i didnt buy it im 57 and like all the women i know in their 50s and 40s more than capable of surviving on my own as i have been doing since i graduated from high school at 13 got legally emancipated and set off on my own lifes journey br br the daughter is not believable in her job role  she gets a promotion she doesnt deserve a great opportunity and drops that ball too but when another female employee steps up to the plate and is ready to deliver the writers shoot her down as an opportunist when she was just doing what any careeroriented person would do  taking advantage of a wideopen opportunity created by the lack of selfdiscipline of her coworker a girl who apparently doesnt understand the concept of honoring her promises to her boss in this casebr br the daughter grudgingly allows her mother to stay with her on a temporary basis but then treats her mother the woman who gave her life and raised her to adulthood like a pariah apparently the writers of tripe like this do not understand that it is not the common thing for parents to act like children and then be treated as children by their children that is just more of the societal baloney that hollywood keeps trying to force down our throats as though we their public were stupid for desiring to be entertained by their creative offeringsbr br this is a sad movie with a stupid ending if the young male restauranteur had been real and not a twodimensional tv character hed have stayed with the mother who was not that much older than him and quite attractive but in the end he falls for the daughter a shallow rather uninteresting girl who has that cuteness of youth but in an ordinary bland way the opportunist young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive physicallybr br there was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the restauranteur preferred the daughter who was an uptight selfish selfcentered btch who treated her mother with unbelievable disrespect to the mother  a woman who was kindhearted sweettempered humorous and had a joie de vivre the daughter could not even begin to comprehend of course the mother had her own flaws she had reacted to her husbands demise by drinking herself into a stupor for a year or two afterwards which supposedly created the rift between her and her smarmy daughterbr br regardless of the way the characters were or were not developed this is a baloney movie and a waste of your valuable viewing time unless you actually like baloney wheres the mustard
1,originally i rented this film for my daughter since she is keen on soccer  and i was not disappointed that way except the plot interfered with the soccer scenes as a dad i suppose i was a little surprised at the introduction of the topic of lesbianism  but i have to admit that as a parent these issues are completely available to children nowadays as uncomfortable as i feel with the topic in a way this emotion was a segue right into the main premise of the film  that at some age you must trust your children to make their own choices this dilemma is introduced by a young britishborn teen girl  jasminder jess  of eastindian heritage who dreams of playing professional soccer the pending marriage of her older sister in a traditional hindu marriage provides many rich opportunities for her to explore in a nice way her hopes and fears for her future br br the multicultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore jesss frustration with her parents expectations for her  again no different in substance than most childparent relationships br br in summary the soccer scenes are great lots to learn in slowmo and while i didnt need the storyline  something was needed to keep the movie going
1,okay i know this doesnt project india in a good light but the overall theme of the movie is not india its shakti the power of a warlord and the power of a mother the relationship between nandini and her husband and son swallow you up in their warmth then things go terribly wrong the interaction between nandini and her father in law  the power of their dysfunctional relationship  and the lives changed by it are the strengths of this movie shah rukh khans performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to the believable desperation of karisma kapoor it is easy to get caught up in the love violence and redemption of lives in this film and find yourself heaving a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax the musical interludes are strengths believable and well done
7,the strange people living in a town go about their lives theres the licker a guy who licks everything a dumpster diver that finds a body which he takes home to live with him a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her a guy who wants to cleanse girls of their wicked waysoffbeat in the extreme this shot in black and white movie is better with out the color the monochrome takes the edge off the two steps up from home movie feel like a troma movie this movie is fun in fits and starts but mostly its weird for weirds sake and soon becomes a crashing bore since one you see the set ups you can kind of guess where its going a lot of the timenot always but enough for it not to be funthough i didnt see the cleansing coming worth a shot if youve nothing else to watch and youre waiting for the next set of golden girls to come from netflix
0,i am a major fan of the horror genre i love horrorslashergore flicks of all kinds some of my favorites are the really good bad horror flicks but this movies has nothing to warrant its viewing im not going to spend a lot of time talking about everything thats wrong with itbr br the script is horrid the acting is horrid the fx are not even worth discussing the set is an absolute joke the sad thing is i think there may be some real potential in a couple of the actors but this vehicle left them nothing to work withbr br suffice it to say i saw it for free  feel i was robbed the time youd waste watching this would be better spent flossing your cat
7,it was considered to be the swiss answer to the lord of the rings but it is much more than that it isnt an answer to anything its in itself something new something funny and sometimes its downright stupid and silly  but was monty python any different than sillybr br the beginning immediately makes the statement that this film is low budget and not meant to be taken entirely seriously cardboard clouds on strings knock into the airplane in which the main character is seated but to compensate the missing special effects the landscape does the trick it is absolutely beautiful and stunning  who needs new zealand switzerland has it all br br what i liked about the film was the simple approach and the obvious passion and energy that went into it it isnt brilliant yet its got some good humorous parts edward piccin as friedo is absolutely convincing it would be enough to go and see the film because of himthere are some good jokes some of them are very lame some of them wont be understood by people outside of switzerland i liked the idea of having urucows instead of uruk hai i loved the scene where friedo decides to take pupsi a telehobbie with him on the journey also very funny is the scene when rackaroll the swordfighting knight decides to show off with his sword  and subsequently smashes it into a wall breaking it and there is this one scene where the nazgulish characters do a wonderfully comic scene that includes a toilet brush i didnt approve of the idea of the ring being used by schleimli the gollum character in order to seduce the ladies that was a bit far fetched the idea of lord sauraus wanting to cover the lands with fondue wasnt that brilliant either original certainly but not brilliant but most of all did i dislike the idea of a gay dragon that really wasnt necessary all in all i recommend to see the film simply because it is so crazy and totally trashy dont expect a lotr parody like spaceballs was for star wars but if you go to the flicks thinking that this is going to be an amusing evening out with absolutely no ambitions then youll enjoy i am not sure if it works in other languages because it does live from the swiss dialects as well as from the jokes and actorsbr br all in all hat off to the courage of the swiss crew who did that
1,david duchovney creates a role that he was to replicate somewhat in californication  the troubled talent and it is a role he plays wellbr br this thriller starts off at a good speed and carries you through to the end timothy hutton plays a fine villain and angelina jolie pouts the story of a disgraced doctor finding his way into a criminal world is well scripted drug addiction and a desire for the sultry jolie mix a heady cocktail unfortunately towards the end the story gets a little weaker and the relationships between villains and the fbi is muddled and rushed as if it was created only to develop the final scene but that aside a movie worth seeing
0,this movie starred a totally forgotten star from the 1930s jack pearl radios baron munchausen as well as jimmy durante however 712 decades later its being billed as a three stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful edna may oliver as well as zazu pittsbr br as for the stooges this is a film from there very early daysbefore mgm had any idea what to do with the team at this point they were known as ted healy and his stooges as healy was the front man fortunately for the stooges they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man read up on himyoull see what i mean and the rest is history within a year they were making very successful shorts for columbia and executives at mgm were soon kicking themselves for losing the team this sort of thing was a common occurrence at mgm a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy such as the films of buster keaton laurel and hardy abbott and costello and others in fact up until they left for columbia mgm put them in a wide variety of odd film rolesincluding acting with clark gable and joan crawford in dancing lady and oddly in this film they didnt act as a teamthey just did various supporting roles such as larry playing the pianobr br this particular film begins with pearl and durante lost in the african jungle when they are rescued and brought home all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety showpunctuated by scenes with the leads here and there as for pearl i could really see why he never made a successful transition to films as he has the personality of a slug but slightly less welcome as for durante i never knew what the public saw in himas least as far as his films are concernedhe was loud andloud he apparently took time off from helping mgm to ruin buster keatons career to make this film together pearl and durante rely on lots of verbal humor and vaudevillestyle routines that tend to fall rather flatbr br in this film the stooges they didnt yet have the right chemistry seeing healy doing the job that moe did in their later films is odd what they did in the film was pretty good but because all the segments were short they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines stooges fans might be very frustrated at this though diehard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their lifelong goal of seeing everything stoogeeven the rotten joe derita and joe besser films oh and did they got bad after the deaths of shemp and curlybr br overall the film is rather dull and disappointing however there are a couple interesting things to look for in the mess at about the 13 minute mark you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing look carefully as this is walter brennan in a role youd certainly never expect another unusual thing to look for in the film is the clean as a whistle song starting at about 22 minutes into the film this song and dance number is clearly an example of a socalled precode scene that never would have been allowed in films after 1934 when the production code was strengthened despite the word clean in the title its a very titillating number with naked women showing lots of fleshenough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything its quite shocking when seen today though such excesses were pretty common in the early 1930s finally at the 63 minute mark see jimmy durante set race relations back a few decades see the film youll see that i mean
2,i originally caught this back in 1996 in its one week run at a movie theatre i was under impressed by it and my feelings havent much changedbr br documentary about the infamous edward d wood jr covering his life and movies there are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him they include vampira dolores fuller bela lugosi jr loretta king gregory walcott and paul marco interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations it is interesting somewhat but was this really needed ive seen all of woods films and theyre just terrible wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out i wouldnt say he was the worst director ever but hes down there do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker i do like the fact that they didnt try to make wood out to be some sort of saint more than a few of those interviewed especially lugosi jr pretty much hated the man and it comes through loud and clear also they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s still its of interest if youre a wood fan the best interviews are with vampira who tears wood apart and dolores fuller a long time girlfriend
2,lot of silly plot holes in the film first we see him watching his master practice kungfu and die in the midst of his practice thats fine with me and then at the end of the film we see him use the kungfu that he learned just by watching his master when he was still a kid is that even possible i dont think sobr br this show is purely for jay chou fans and the film lacks a depth in terms of character development cinematography styles and unfolding of plotbr br anybody notice that the captain of the basket team forgot his name and the idolized player li xiao look so similar to each other to the extent that youd think they were the one and same person long hair sunshineboy look tall and strong the two of them looked like they came out from a mass production factory designed to churn out products that makes teenage girls scream wild in orgasm not that those two actors had anything of value to contribute to the movie as a whole for the movie industry at allbr br the jokes were lame and not funny at allbr br the scene with regards to the masters of jay chou coming back to help him out in the basketball court degenerated into a pointless plot when they started bashing their opponents ala royal rumble style worse of all when the masters won the fight the crowd began cheering and the match continued it was truly a wtf momentbr br at the end of the show when they win the match all thanks to jay chous excellent kung fu skills how he acquired those kungfu skills is a mystery because the show somehow shows him acquiring the skills just by observing his masterbr br and then his longlost father comes out of the woodwork to acknowledge jay chou as his longlost son seemed just a tad too quick of the director to wrap up the filmbr br in short this is a jay chouflick instead of the usual chick flick watch it only if jay chou is your fan if you are one of those whose tastes in movies coincide greatly with those in the list of imdbs top 250 films of all time then this film is not for you
7,ten minutes worth of story stretched out into the better part of two hours when nothing of any significance had happened at the halfway point i should have left but ever hopeful i stayed and left with a feeling of guilt for having wasted the time acting was ok but the story line is so transparent and weak the script is about as lame as it could get but again stretching out the ten minute plot doesnt leave a whole lot of room for good dialogue
7,i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with meto tell the truth i think that the younger kevin dillon was hothahahahabut i also thought the girl was stupid to go along with the cop and that was wrong what he said to her before his deathi was inside youi think thats what she gets for doing what she did with him and how is he going to tell her that shes too young when he never cared how old the other girls werenow i dont think i myself could ever trust a cop like thatbut to tell the truth it was pretty obvious it was him even if he was wanting to become a cop i would still be suspicious of him either wayand that was funny when she sprayed him in the eye in the storehahahahahashe was still stupid for going into the warehouse again by herself and so was the cop who died hello its called backupsometimes these movies make me mad when people act stupid and do stupid thingsbut thats what i think an thought about the movie
3,ive said this in other reviews without a story you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want still no one will give a damnbr br the director seems to have a great eye for 30s art deco which i love and i think the idea of using all digital backgrounds and such could indeed be the wave of the future in movie making however its obvious the director got so interested in the digital rendering of his movie he forgot to film many scenes which would have enormously helped this surprisingly thinnedplotted film spoiler for crying out loud they forgot to have a villain in this thing ok they have one but hes been dead for 20 years by the time the movie takes place conran misses the point of having a villain as far as action goes well lets see sky captain law shoots down one robot two or three of the flapping wing airplanes before dex ribisi tells him to stop shooting them down and a couple robots but mostly spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight his battles for him paltrow as polly or peggy or punky or whatever is totally wasted in this movie the reviewer who comments on hers and laws lack of chemistry is so right and i for one got a little sick of seeing repeated shots of the top of her camera showing she only has two shots left both of which she wastes subsequently in the movie one uncomically one quite funny although i saw it coming from 70 years away no one except law and paltrow have any significant time on screen and thats the movies real flaw an audience doesnt identify with robots they need a hero to root for and a visible despicable villain to hate without that plus a good engaging story all the cg in the world wont help
5,only once in a while do we get an rrated comedy that gets everyones time and attention its an even rarer case when the critics will like it i just came back from the 40 yearold virgin and i can honestly say it was one of the biggest laughs of my life i went to a 1035 showing and every row was filled not only that everyone laughed their ass off the whole time through its two hours of nonstop laughing i dare you to see this film and to not laughbr br the plot is simple a man is forty years old and he is a virgin yet behind this simple five second joke we are given a deep complex story that is not only one of the funniest youll ever witness but has genuine lessons behind it steve carell stars as andy stitzer the 40 yearold virgin we have known steve carell as in my opinion one of the best scene thieves of all time stealing hilarious scenes from bruce almighty and especially anchorman steve carell has come a long way as finally and proudly is given his moment to shine as the star no one will forget his name once they witness this pervasively funny gutbusting rollintheaisle hilarious comedybr br the beauty about the film is it isnt 100 stupid the brilliant writing of judd apatow and steve carell genuinely has purpose and its not just one hell of a story to tell behind the crudeness and vulgar nonstop ride of the film comes an important lesson to be learned although not presented in the best way possible the film gives us more than a purely enjoyable time its gutbusting attitude will have you laughing the whole time through while we simultaneously see the real life struggles of people like andy and his fellow coworkers the end couldnt have been better not only does it deliver what we are promised but it gives one of the most memorable finishing numbers a comedy has ever seen it would have been perfect if there was vince vaughn and owen wilson in there cameoing somehow but you cant win em all now can youbr br finally i think as roger ebert put it catherine keener gives an unexplainable perfect performance as trish the one woman andy has his heart truly for not only does she also give us laughs but it is crazy to see how brightly she fuels the story she was cast perfected in the role and her and carell have terrific not to mention hilarious chemistry on screenbr br canadian ratingswise once again ontario slips away with a 14a while british columbia alberta and manitoba all slapped the 40 yearold virgin with an 18a the same thing happened with four brothers in my opinion the second best film of the year and i can honestly say that i love ontario more and more so for that to all you fellow teenagers out there in the states good luck sneaking in br br overall steve carell gives one of the funniest performances ive ever seen and just about everyone in the cast distributes to the nonstop laughter everyone will love the 40 yearold virgin this summer and i encourage everyone to see it as fast as humanly possible it is the best comedy of the year hands down it beats all over the longest yard the wedding crashers and of course apatow and carells last memorable comedy anchormanbr br it is a comic masterpiece and deserves the remarkable amount of praise from the critics who have been loving it every single one of my favourite critics loved it and it deserves a spot on the imdb top 250 right away steve carell is a huge star watch one of the brightest ones of the summer right nowbr br my rating 910 br br objectively  910 br br subjectively  1010 br br eliason a
1,i saw his film at the ann arbor film festival i am a film student at the univeristy of michigan so i know a thing or two about film and crispin glovers film is outrageous he basically exploits the mentally challenged not only is shirly temple the antichrist which i admit is a little funny telling the mentally challenged to kill each other but there is an obsession with killing snails crispin also plays with the idea of being in love with one of his actors who is as they all are mentally challenged peta and human rights should be all over this thing its not counterculture as crispin stated at the ann arbor film festival its exploitation
2,although it got some favorable press after playing at the toronto intl film festival there were a number of reasons not to expect too much from this one  its an ultralow budget canadian film two  its written directed and starring the same person usually a bad sign unless its woody allen george clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers but despite my watching it with lowered expectations it still turned out to a far bigger disappointment than i thought possiblebr br in a nutshell  bad script bad acting terrible directing dont waste your time or money on this turkey it claims to be a comedy but i only laughed twice plus there is awful music blaring throughout how this got any attention ill never know
6,not that hed care but im not one of simon peggs friends if i was theres a good chance wed fallout if he continued to make dross like this the trouble is he found a successful formula as the bumbling ordinary guynextdoor type in shawn of the dead run fat boy run etc but its starting to wear thin here his character has no discernible qualities hes rude and obnoxious and thinks hes funny when he frankly isnt when transferred to new york from london and i presume this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the atlantic he proves equally out of place with his new colleagues still is it any wonder when amongst his jolly japes he hires a transvestite stripper to appear at an editorial meeting an act of revenge for his boss yet somehow kirsten dunst starts to warm to him even though hes done nothing nice oh and because hes a superficial male he falls for megan fox at first sight possibly because her character is as shallow as his it all makes for a predictable film conclusion although i cant see any viewer expressing how this mirrored their life the shame is that on paper this is a cast supposedly worth watching pegg though plays himself kirsten dunst seems to just go though the motions creating no on screen chemistry and megan fox isnt stretched at all the one huge plus is miriam margolyes as peggs new york landlady  now if she had been on screen longer
1,there are some wonderful things about this movie marion davies could act given the right property she is wonderful in comedic roles william haines could act and you can see why he was one of the screens most popular leading men until a potential scandal forced him from the businessbr br the story is a bit trite but handled so beautifully that you dont notice king vidors direction is one of the principle reasons for this the producer the boy genius irving thalbergbr br its about movie making and you get to see the process as it was done in 1928 the cameras sets directors directing and actors emoting you get to see briefly some of the major stars of the day even charlie chaplin does a turn as himself seeking an autograph you also catch glimpses of eleanor boardman elinor glyn claire windsor king vidor and many others who are otherwise just names and old photographsbr br please even if youre not a fan of the silents take the time to catch this film when you can its really a terrific trip back in time
1,definitely one of my favourite movies the story is good acting is great all technicals especially cinematography are sharp and the script is cleverbr br heath ledger is terrific as edward ned kelly he is gripping as the legendary outlaw and is supported well by geoffrey rush naomi watts and orlando bloom all action sequences are on pointbr br the film is edgeofyour seat stuff right up to to the end one of my favourite films from the late legend heath ledger who has been the highlight of every film he has starred in and makes no mistake herebr br an excellent film all round
3,well after long anticipation after seeing a few clips on bravos the 100 scariest movie moments i had long awaited to see this film the plot was simple beautiful model alison parker cristina raines moves into an apartment building thats a gateway to hell the sentinel is a down right creepy film even if its a bit slow its a mix of the omen and rosemarys baby the acting is fine and there are some truly disturbing bits such as the awkward orgy scene with the dead father and the chubby woman in the middle of the orgy eating cake and laughing the ending is a weird mix of deformed people and cannibals its a very odd campy but in the end i truly believe a great film one of my favorites from the 70s even if its nothing greatly original its wacky and extremely creepy probably one of my all time favorites 910
7,oh dear while chevy chase and the gang at snl set new highs with the sketch show format this fails miserably at every level fortunately chevy is barely in this at all and cant be blamed for this utter tripe it seriously is very very bad while meant to be a political comment on usa at the time of its release 1974 it still remains neither funny or acutely observed the sketches are all way too long and any satirical impact they may have had is lost as theyre all drawn out to the point of complete boredom this is credited as chevys movie debut and im pleased to say that everything he did after this bettered it avoid even if curious
7,baldwin has really stooped low to make such movies the script the music just about everything in this movie is a waste of timebr br the sound fx do not sound real they stick out way too much technical gadgets etc if they are trying to make a movie about things like this at least try to get real with it and drop those extra bleeps and beeps because those gadgets dont really make loud sounds like that natural sounds like footsteps and such are nonexistent which gives it a voidlike atmospherebr br directing seems to be ok for such a low budget film i sure hope it was a low budget production although it does seem fairly amateurish at timesbr br most characters seem empty and false they simply havent casted this movie very well id imagine it wouldve been a better idea to make baldwin speak some spanish than to make spanish actors speak english when we all know that theirs is the language which is more vibrant and alive that is why the actors performance can suffer greatly if an odd language is used i mean could finally someone realise how stupid it sounds to make international actors speak english with a bad accent its shouldve a long ago buried corpse in movie production the production team ever heard of subtitles this movie again manages to depict european police as lazy and corrupt the societies as vulnerable and helpless i mean if the plot again goes like the interpol cant do jack so lets call one american to bring down this international syndicate or whateverbr br sony pictures treads on the same path as columbia before it just producing movies for the hell of it id imagine them to have some self respect also are buyers supposed to buy every dirty title just because sony puts out something good a few times a year maybe they shouldve used the same team as who were making di que si  say i do its spoken in spanish and paz vega and santi millan do a decent job keeping the movie afloat looks and sounds much better come on sony wake up produce less sell more
0,first this film is not a thriller neither is it gripping taut it might have been so based on the script but the directions slow pace makes it difficult to get intobr br the plot itself is very interesting and ingenious unfortunately we only get a sense of how ingenious after the picture is over that leaves us with over two hours of long sequences with music playing over them punctuated by some action scenes that dont grab the viewer and cunning vixen scenes that inject a little more overt intelligencebr br i wish this had been the fastpaced thriller the box promised it wouldve been an outstanding film instead spike lee made it plod along through the end
7,a scientist and his girl friend are out driving when his speeding causes a car crash he escapes unharmed but she is decapitated he saves her head brings it to his house and keeps it alive  he then proceeds to search out models and strippers for the perfect body for the head his crippled assistant watches over the head which starts talking and has a telepathic or telepathetic link to a deformed monster kept in the closetbr br as you can see this is pretty stupid stuff but i had a certain fondness for it when i grew up in the late 1970s a local tv station showed this movie about 20 times each year no exaggeration they showed it always on saturday afternoon tvuncut seeing this on tv back then was great explicit blood and gore along with a gruesome monster and sleazy sexploitationwho cares if it was good seeing it now i realize how lousy this really isbr br the acting is perfectly wretched the production values are nonexistent the script is pretty dumb and aside from the still pretty disgusting gore this is dull stuff theres also a mild cat fight between two women and the admittedly great monster at the end also add in an ending which leaves tons of loose ends on one hand this is an interesting example of a 1960s exploitation film on the other its utter trash either way its not a good movie but is a mustsee for one time only for horror and gore fansbr br also the heads laugh is pretty creepy note the end credits which gets the title wrong calling it the head that wouldnt die
1,sandwiched in between san francisco and captains courageous two of spencer tracys greatest parts is this very curious film about war and the effects it has on some people they gave him a gun stars spencer tracy and franchot tone in the only film they ever made together and gladys george as the woman who loves them bothbr br tracy and tone are a couple of world war i draftees tone is a weak character who almost goes over the hill in boot camp but tracy stops him tracy is still playing the lovable blowhard younger wallace beery type that mgm envisioned for him when they signed him away from fox br br over at the front tone gets an opportunity and takes it when during a fight he manages to get to a church tower that peers down on a german machine gun nest hes learned to shoot by now and he does a sergeant york but alvin c york was never changed by the war the way tone hasbr br wounded in the fight tone convalesces at a hospital with gladys george looking out for him tracy goes awol himself to visit his pal and he and george get something going later on when tracy is reported missing in action tone and george marry tracys brokenhearted when he comes back and learns of the marriage but takes sit in stride br br the rest of the film is dealing with tone applying the the wartime skills hes learned to the gangster trade hes a hitman now and george doesnt really know what he does for a living i think you can figure the rest outbr br the part of the film that gave me some trouble is that i cant believe gladys george couldnt figure it out shes a street smart girl her part is very much like the one she played in the roaring twenties opposite james cagneybr br speaking of the roaring twenties humphrey bogarts character development there is similar to tones although he was not the central character of the movie in fact there are elements of they gave him a gun that are to be found in taxi driver and in clint eastwoods classic the unforgiven br br the world war i battle sequences are very well staged by director woody van dyke for some reason leonard maltin panned this film i think its a lot better than he gave it credit
4,band camp was awful the naked mile was a little better and this third straight to dvd in the american pie franchise seems the same quality as the predecessor basically erik stifler john white split from his girlfriend after losing his virginity and now him and mike cooze coozeman jake siegel are joining eriks cousin dwight steve talley at college with the promise of many parties plenty of booze and enough hot chicks at the beta house they only have fifty listed tasks to carry out to become official privileged members but a threat comes into sight with the rivals gek geek house led by powerhungry nerd and sheep shagger edgar tyrone savage offering bigger and better than what beta have to settle it once and for all beta and gek go into battle with the banned for forty years greek games to beat each other in with the loser moving out the last champion of the games noah levenstein aka jims dad the only regular eugene levy runs the show which sees the people unhooking bras a gladiator duel floating on water catching a greased pig russian roulette in the mouth with cartridges of aged horse spunk wife carrying and drinking a full keg of alcohol with puking not disqualifying it all comes to the sudden death with a guy getting stripper lap dancing and they have to resist cumming beta house win when edgar cums with a girl dressed as a sheep on his lap also starring flubbers christopher mcdonald as mr stifler meghan heffern as ashley dan petronijevic as bull nic nac as bobby christine barger as margie italia ricci as laura johnson moshana halbert as sara coleman sarah power as denise andreja punkris as stacy and jordan prentice as rock the nudity amount is very slightly increased as is the grossness of the jokes and i could guess it being rated one star out of five but i like it adequate
0,yes i did as i sit here redfaced remembering having felt almost guilty as i watched it a couple of weeks back while my wife chose to watch something as inconsequential in comparison as mommie dearestbr br how does one explain the appeal of batman and robin  i mean the only ones who ever really counted adam west and burt ward it was a terrible show with terrible plots and terrible acting  and oh yes it was terribly funny and the same applies to this reunion and flashback movie adam and burt are invited to an auction where the old batmobile is going to be sold off for charity but it gets stolen and our pals as themselves jump into their old characters personas if not their costumes and head off to find out whats happened along the way they reminisce about the series and we see how it all came together in flashbacks with jack brewer and jason marsden playing the young adam and burt of the tv series it really was quite interesting to get some behind the scenes looks at the old series and adam and burt just stepped perfectly back into character even though they werent really in character  well youd have to watch it to see what i mean it was also great to see julie newmar and frank gorshinbr br if youre not a fan of the old series youll hate this if  heaven forbid  you actually thought michael keaton and george clooney made acceptable batmans then youll hate this even more but if you grew up with adam and burt and are still willing to admit that you never missed an episode  well this ones for youbr br yes its true  910
0,this movie is little more than poorlymade fetish porn and this is saying a lot considering the similar crap that was made in that era this was recommended to me by friend as a unique film experience he was right i suppose he meant that as a joke not disgusting not even that shocking just mediocre acting and poor attempts at shock art a little bit of camp value though i dont believe the makers of this film intended this and yes as a previous reviewer mentioned its sex with a guy in a bear suit dont spend a lot of money on this try to borrow it if you must see it or contact me id be happy to sell you my copy for half pricebr br i may have to see another of this particular directors films as he seems to have a certain following but if its anything like this i will again regret another hours of my life gone forever
5,really an amazing pile of pap br br a predictable slow moving soul destroying mind numbing movie to which slitting your own wrists with a rusty bread knife seems well almost necessarybr br the acting is over done for the thin dialogue every scene is at least twice as long as it needs to be the intricate details of how this career is collapsing or that career is rising is just far too dreary and mundane for words the music would be good if you didnt have to sit through the movie but really three good songs is not enough reward for the effort required to watch the moviebr br watching this film i prayed to god for narcolepsy or for someone to shoot mebr br never ever ever again
0,one of the worst romantic comedies nay worst movies ive ever seen boy who works as a phone psychic must pretend to be gay to move into apartment with woman of his dreams hilarity does not ensue boredom light gaybashing and horrible dialogue do if you read brad meltzer and like his crappy dialogue youll like this moviebr br be smart avoid this if you see it destroy the copy
1,the exploding zeppelins crashing down upon sky captain jude laws base present an adequate metaphor to describe how truly terrible this movie is first off let me state right off the bat that i sincerely doubt that paramount will ever recover any money from this film a cult hit it might become but only because it is so remarkable for what it failed to achieve i can see the studio pitch now lets combine 1920s german expressionism and a 1940s globetrotting adventure with a modern action flick and use computer animation to dominate every scene wow wont that be a success  skycaptain bludgeons the viewer with its sheer excess there are too many fake explosions too many unconvincing dogfight scenes and too few real moments where the characters are anything but painfully twodimensional after all why shock and awe with one floating airship when you can have three or five or one hundred moreover what could have been a groundbreaking film seamlessly combining computer generated imagery and human actors in a stylized and intriguing setting will instead become a flop in no small part because it fails to meet the most important requirement of any flick using cgi quite simply the graphics are amazingly poor from the movement of the cars to the physics of the aircraft in the dogfights everything seems to be just a little off im not being nitpicky here in any way an infant could notice that a car doesnt glide along the road like a maglev train unless its a mercedes s500 and for those of you raising your voices in protest crying out this is a stylized film its not supposed to be like reality let me just say this lord of the rings has set the standard for integrating reallife actors with cgi starship troopers has set the standard for ironic science fiction films the rocketeer did a solid job reintroducing the decade of the 1920s back into the hollywood film portfolio and tim burtons batman created a unique picture of new york citygotham that has yet to be repeated sky captain falls so short of all these films it is hard for me to mention them in the same sentence plus the acting is so poor it makes me positively ill so there you have it i spent to see this film and you get my review i hope it might dissuade you all from making the same mistake that i did
2,this ones a romp many trek fans dont rate this as high as the wellknown alltime classic episodes because it lacks the deep meaning or undertone of those really great ones but this one is so well executed for what it is so successful as pure entertainment it always makes my personal list of the top half dozen episodes no matter what mood im in several well known future movies westworld and tv shows the more bland fantasy island took their cue from the premise of this episode then of course the tng show revamped the concept with the holodeck technology beautifully filmed especially evident in the restored version and on dvd and directed it takes place in the nice parklike setting of a planet which the enterprise has just arrived to its odd that no animal life even insects seems to exist here how are flowers pollinated for example but things turn really odd when members of the landing party start seeing people from their past kirk has a peopleheavy past it turns out as well as figures from other wellknown fantasy stories sulu even finds an oldstyle police revolver adding to his collection of swords no doubtbr br by this point in the trek series halfway thru the first season the main characters had pretty much solidified into the old friends wed come to know over the many proceeding years here we get to really see them relax converse and work together to figure out this episodes puzzle the strong narrative is a mystery again of sorts and the audience is along for the ride as kirk  friends seek to unravel a very bizarre series of events which have a decidedly amusing flavor to them its almost whimsical following up on the carefree style established up on the starship as kirk was finally maneuvered into beaming down after showing definite signs of stress and fatigue the enterprise had its suggested just completed a harrowing mission then dr mccoy is killed by a knight on horseback yes this is dr mccoys final episodejust kidding but its no joke to the rest of the landing party at this point in the story mccoy really is dead for all intents and purposes and like the best trek episodes the 2nd half of this adventure escalates to a more frantic more desperate tempo of action and suspense this is all signaled by kirks resolute response to sulu who voices his lack of understanding about any of these events just after mccoys death  kirk will get to the bottom of all this come what maybr br but it doesnt get much easier for kirk what follows is probably the longest staged manoamano fight for the series as kirk tussles with his nemesis from his academy days a struggle that seems to take place over half the planet yet this is counterbalanced by scenes of extraordinary tenderness with another of kirks past acquaintances this episode runs the gamut of all human experience rather fitting in light of what we learn about the actual purpose of this weird planet its gratifying that the script really does explain all of whats happened as opposed to some nonsensical approach which permeates many other fantasy  scifi series with similar plot lines unexplained appearances by persons who could not possibly be there and there actually is a subtext to the story  that we humans need to work off our tensions and fatigue in a particular fashion or we just dont function in a normal natural way also note the appearance of the very cute yeoman barrows and the sudden absence of yeoman rand who did not return until the first trek movie in 79 i believe that after this episode even more trek fans couldnt wait for the next appearance of all their favorite characters but i leave this episode with a final perhaps tantalizing thought if mccoy was killed verified by spock how do we know it was our real mccoy who beamed back up to the ship perhaps this explains why this mccoy was still inspecting starships about a century later and getting along very well with data
6,i love this movie my friend marcus and i were browsing the local hastings because we had an urge to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled across this fine film we had no idea what it was going to be about but it turned out spectacular thumbs up i liked how the film was shot and the actors were very funny if you are are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think i highly suggest you quickly run to your local video store and find this movie i would tell you some of my favorite parts but that might ruin the film for you so i wont this movie is definitely on my top 10 list of good movies do you really think nothing is bouncy
1,i rented zero day from the local video store last week i had never heard of the film and i had my reservations about it just from looking at the box i knew the film was an indie film and therefore the quality was going to be less than a mainstream film br br i can tell you that after i finished watching zero day i immediately started it from the beginning again the film was clearly following the basic outline of what happened at columbine high school of april of 1999 but what struck me was how believable the two lead actors were my first time through watching this film i wasnt entirely sure if what i was watching were actual tapes left behind by the shooters at columbine in the back of my mind i knew what i was watching could not be real but at the same time the acting was so convincing you had to keep giving your head a shake br br is the film disturbing absolutely are you going to see things that will make you question the merit of the film probably i think what most people will find disturbing is they will actually have feelings for the two lead characters calvin and andre played by cal robertson and andre keuck why is that problematic for some people calvin and andre are planning a massacre at their high school i know for myself i felt an immense sadness for andre and calvin i had empathy for them because their lives had come to such a horrific point they had fallen so deeply through cracks that they had begun a journey down a road which could have been stopped if only people around them had taken notice to their plight br br zero day is a phenomenal film it gives you an up close and personal look to events that most of us will only ever see the conclusion to on the news it leaves you thinking about the lives involved and it leaves you perplexed how people get to this point a week after seeing this film i still think about itbr br those of you who have not seen zero day please keep in mind the following the film is an independent with little to no budget and the film is shot on camcorders the material in the film is disturbing this is not mainstream hollywood and there is no happy ending br br but if you can put all that aside zero day is a film that will stick with you and just maybe help you to open your eyes a little
6,one of the those coming of age films that should have nostalgia for adults and promise for the kids this movie has neither it is a poor excuse to let sylvia kristels body double frolic with a dorky eric brown to make matters worse the movie is either silly or stupid when it tries to be funny sexy or dramatic laugh awkwardly as we are supposed to believe that a teenager would go alone with burying a dead woman in his front yard ponder vigorously on why a woman famous for emmanuelle needs a body double as the movie went on and on i started to imagine a hybrid of private lessons and little miss millions that had sylvia kristel seduce jennifer love hewitt as howard hesseman makes us nostalgic for wkrp watch this to laugh at other peoples stupidity or for ed begley jrs committed performance or to wonder what sylvia kristel would look like with jennifer love hewitt but i can give you an idea of your lesson stay away from movies staring sylvia kristel that are not emmanuelle
2,i dont remember the last time i reacted to a performance as emotionally as i did to justin timberlakes in edison i got so emotional i wanted to scream in anguish destroy the screen readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism timberlake is horribly miscast in fact casting him is like casting andy dick to play the lead role in patton or nathan lane to play jesus but that is almost beside the pointbr br timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role i used to have problems with ben afflecks acting talent but timberlake makes affleck look like sir ian mckellen or dame judi dench with his metrosexual lisp read lithp his boyish glances and emotional expressions which derive from something like the 25 clich expressions for actors he poisons the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly and no matter how you slice it i do not and will not buy his role as an amateurturnedcrusaderforjustice journalist it simply will not flybr br however timberlake alone isnt to blame for his failure director david j burke puts him not only in the essentially primary role but also places him aside morgan freeman kevin spacey john heard dylan mcdermott cary elwes and im surprised he was as good ll cool j i can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with timberlakebr br there is an upside to this of course the moment any of these actors interact without justin there it feels like a double relief a pleasure if you will freeman and spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time alone together but that ten minutes is blissful in contrast to their scenes with our socalled hero dylan mcdermott is also a breath of fresh airbr br but enough of timberlake bashing  words arent enough in this particular case to do the trick edison is a very very runofthemill corruption story its plot ranges from clich to simply preposterous i do however admire the motivation behind making it which i interpret as an homage to films like serpico or donnie brasco or maybe even chinatown dont get me wrong  edison is not even in the same ballpark as these films but i can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence perhaps to justify my sitting through itbr br the script in and of itself features some surprisingly bad writing yes it has some decent interchanges but any conversation between piper perabo who is wasted here and timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a dawsons creek episode its your typical fartooglibforreality letsimpresstheaudiencewithhowwellwearticulate and fail dialogue this dialogue mind you is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments  sometimes it feels like edison wants to morph into a music video where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting but precisely through the badly chosen music and variant film speeds read slowmotionbr br thinking about it edison is a curiosity its sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by timberlake who simply doesnt work in film as in most art if one thing is off the whole thing feels off directors must make tough choices david j burke missed the mark here some of the scenes play well in and of themselves but as a whole they dont seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into one incoherent picture and its not particularly an exciting puzzle to begin with
5,for people interested in business and the corporate world this show is simply the best of the best as one of the former contestants of the show wrote in his blog about this innovative show people in business finally had an audience the whole idea is perfect having a group of businesspeople competing against each other in businessrelated tasks set in the best place in the world new york city donald trump is perfect as the boss even though his ego is bigger than the whole universe times infinity he also makes a lot of questionable decisions about whom to fire which is one of the negatives about the showbr br season great season overall the best season of the normal ones this season was the one that was most about actual business skills later on the series almost drowned in marketing related tasks with way too many product placements great and interesting contestants overall with the most likable character ever in this series troy i know im not the only person who suspect that the trump world towerepisode where he got fired was rigged to have amy and nick win this particular taskbr br season also a great season the tasks were still pretty much ok and it had many interesting contestants jen m was terrible and should never had made it to the final imo also this season had the worst firing ever pamelabr br season terrible actually i liked the concept of book smarts vs street smarts but the cast was so utterly terrible it turned out that trump hated the cast as well that the whole season was a total disaster best moments was the second episode motel renovation with pm brian fired a guy who added nothing but huge amounts of comedy valuebr br season an excellent season much because of the interesting and entertaining contestants this season especially randall alla marcus and the total disaster whose name was toral the take me out to the boardroom episode is one of the absolute classics of this show ending with the wellremembered quadruple firing sadly i think we got robbed for the randall vs alla final i think trump was afraid that she could have won and prevented that from happeningbr br season a boring season with really no special things to it brent was just an embarrassment and obviously only there to create drama the tasks were terrible overall how has creating a jingle anything to do with business at all i guess the best man won but personally i couldnt care lessbr br season i can see why they wanted to try out la as a new location for the show but looking back it was a mistake new york will always be the place for this this season added so many new things most of them terrible like losing team having to sleep outside in tents winning pm continues to be pm for example the tasks were terrible and trump also chose the wrong winner james deserved it no doubtbr br season celebrity edition best season ever totally different rules like the use of rolodexes but all fun and entertainment the biggest problem was that many of the contestants were not real celebrities at all especially the women where everyone were unknown to me except for omarosa who is a total disgrace to everything she takes part in this looked to be gene simmons season but after he made a complete fool of himself during the kodak task  another man emerged from the shadows piers morgan never has anyone dominated a season like he did he crushed his opponents and also came across as a guy with a great sense of humor although some uptight americans not all americans of course dont take me wrong sadly didnt have the social skills to understand it way to go piersbr br for fans of this i highly recommend the uk version starring sir alan sugar as the boss in fact the british version is way better and that says something since the american and original truly is a great show one thing about the uk version is that the contestants normally tend to behave like decent human beings in the boardroom unlike the constant yelling and rude behavior that takes place in the us version
5,margret laurence probably didnt intend on having any of her novels adopted for film let alone the stone angel hagar as a character was one who constantly challenged the social norm gainsay who dare anyone and ended up nearly sacrificing her humanity in the process the symbols in the book the stone angel silver thread etc etc are constant reminders of this struggle of the old and new and the carnage so to speak along the waybr br while the film is reasonably faithful to the plot of the book but it isnt really a plot kindof storytelling is it i think it missed the point on capturing the spirit of the film hagars defiance for the sake of defiance was not there bram could have been a lot more crude than portrayed and hagars father could have been played more traditionally so to speak if the filmmaker would insisted on stronger portrayals the film would drive the point straight to homebr br along the same vein why should we see cell phones organic produce and other modernizations are we trying make some points for the sake of making some points eg the muslim girlfriend and the native people hagar and co are everything but politically correct in the book so why should we see that in the film version modernization may be an excuse for a lowbudget operation but using that as an excuse to send subliminal politicallycorrect messages that are totally irrelevant to the novel and the film seems like throwing punches below the intellectbr br there is also the audience it seems that we have been conditioned to see bitter old people as cute and lovable why should be laugh every time hagar is at her tantrums i doubt magaret laurence wanted her readers to laugh at or with hagar these people are frustrated and are full of angst and all we do is to laugh at them i dont think it did hagar and other folks in her situation any justice
0,sadly marry harron decided to do a fictional account of bettie pages life to go along with her own issues with men as typical in all her work every major male character is portrayed as weak bumbling or twisted to add to her fiction she projects ideas and issues that are not true according to bettie page herself bettie did not leave the biz because she thought it was morally wrong or had religious issues though she became a bornagain later in life through the influence of her 3rd husband a minister she left it because she was in her late 30s her acting career had gone nowhere and she felt she was losing her looks the hints of molestation and rape are unvalidated and denied in betties own words and are the directors attempts to claim that any woman who did what bettie did must have been victimized by men harron fails to point out that bettie designed her own clothes in almost all her shoots not handed to her by sick fetishists harron also fails to make a point that bunny yeager who did many famous photo shoots of bettie also did many naughty shoots with bettie and was not the morally upright professional photographer portrayed in the filmbr br the only saving grace is gretchen mol looks very much like bettie otherwise there are other movies and documentaries more accurate and honest to her life and the people in it
7,this movie is a great way for the series to finally end peter the boy from puppet master iii is all grown up and is now the puppet master well this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn toulons secrets but instead she listens to the story about the puppets most of this movie is footage from puppet master ii puppet master iii puppet master puppet master curse of the puppet master and retro puppet master sorry but i guess paramount wouldnt let them use scenes from personally i wish puppet master vs demonic toys would finally be made but the way this movie ends they basically say this is the final movie in the series
2,at the point in time that the lady from shanghai was being made the marriage of orson welles and rita hayworth was disintegrating the film was as much an effort by welles to rekindle the old flames as it was to make a classic noir not received well at the time the lady from shanghai has gotten more and more critical acclaim as years pass gotten better with age so to speakbr br welles is irish seaman michael ohara who on a fateful night rescues the beautiful rita hayworth from three muggers in central park sparks do fly but then comes the rub turns out the lady is married to crippled but brilliant criminal attorney everett sloane nevertheless sloane takes an apparent liking to welles and hires him to skipper his yachtbr br so far this film is starting to sound a lot like gilda if orson had seen gilda and was not at this point thinking with his male member he would have skedaddled back to the seamans hiring hall in lower manhattan instead he gets himself involved in a lovely web or intrigue and finds himself pegged for two murders and sloane as his eminent counselbr br welles for whatever reason decided that his wife would be a blond in this film supposedly harry cohn hit the roof as rita was internationally known for her coppery red hair this may have soured him on the picture as he joined the legion of studio bosses who saw welless vision of independent film making a threat to their powerbr br stage actor glenn anders plays sloanes partner grisby who is one slimy dude he winds up a corpse the other corpse to be here is ted decorsia a bottom feeding private detective who tries to go in business for himselfbr br its a good noir thriller showing rita at her glamorous best even if she was a blond here the final shoot out in the hall of mirrors is beautifully staged but i wouldnt recommend seeing it if one is on any controlled substance
1,the problem is that the movie rode in on the coattails of the 60screated concept that comic books could only be done as camp ie the 60s batman show for tv and movie thus you have combat sequences with subtitles come on a cluelessly unromantic doc savage he was uncomfortable around women in the pulps not an idiot monk mayfair in a nightsheet a scene guaranteed to give you nightmares for several nights and the totally hokey ending with the secondary bad guy encased in gold like a herve villechez posing for an oscar statute and when theyre not doing booming sousa march scores the tinkly little funny music undercuts much of the dramabr br even as such this movie isokay its fun and when it stays serious its a very accurate representation of the pulps except for monk as has been mentioned before hes hugely muscled not obese and long tom who is supposed to be a pale scrawny guy with an attitude not paul gleason with an inexplicable scarfbr br the green death sequences for instance are remarkably gruesome and not something id recommend for children but they are very close to the feel of the pulps when the writers and producers get it right they do get it right  ill give them thatbr br but if the producers had done doc with the loving care and scripting of say reeves first two superman movies think what we might have had then i think the problem is the movies schizophrenic theres a definite sense of trying to do a 30s homage but theyre also trying to give in to the heroes must be camp attitude that batman created one gets the impression there was a sober pulpstyle first draft and then someone came in and said hey lets make it funny  it worked with the batman show years agobr br but doc lives on thanks to earl macrauch and buckaroo banzai if macrauch aint doing a homage to doc savage in that movie the man is truly demented so when the series actually gets on tv allegedly midseason in 9900 doc savage updated to the 90s will live once more
1,as the summary says you just made the most ignorant comment i have ever heard on an rpg you seriously thought they were gay are you retarded if you went to go save your best friend and someone decides out of the goodness of his heart to help you then you are in a serious debt to that man lavitz was a good person and each time they helped each other it made them closer as friends they werent gay lovers like your bitching about and to let you know the game is set in a medieval time period back then women did just prepare meals while the men fought do you even know your history do you know how long it took for women to be accepted in the army in present day this game contains a lot of realism even though your too damn slow obviously to catch it and you really need to spit out some solid proof instead of ignorant assumptions based off your misguided act to interpret the story
2,if this is a 2008 product from one of the biggest production houses of indian film industry yash raj then i am afraid it is a very long ahead for us to reach the right standardsbr br if you can go wrong to this length with such an enormous star cast of anil akshay saif and kareena then movie making is still to be studied much harder by everyone associated with this film the film lacks in almost all departments except cinematography and akshay kumar he has a few good dialogues to render but that alone cannot make you enjoy a flick with huge expectationsbr br the first scene of a car going down into a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon film that itself was a clear indicator of the directors vision every actor who otherwise is an asset to a movie is simply wasted anil kapoors gimmick of attempting good english falls flat most of the times and saif will surely hit himself thinking why he signed this moviebr br in short its the biggest waste of resourses after jhoom barabar jhoom i would say that even aaja nachle was a better enjoyable movie than thisbr br one cannot understand how and why this kind of script was written and approved the most unwanted was the flashback sequence of akshays love story after the faulty script the weakest point of the movie is its music vishal shekhar have given just some filler tunes to each song the songs start off very well and suddenly the tunes drop drastically only one song falak tak chal is somehow good of all in the lot an opportunity wasted by vishal shekharbr br regarding the continuity intelligence of the makers just sample this  akshay and saif are on the road in the hilly area of a foreign location probably ladakh in the next scene they are searching for kareena in haridwar and then back in the hills with kareena in the dicky of their car i am still thinking who wrote thisbr br if you manage to sit till the last then the climax is too long with silly and unnecessary stunts you can see all the heroes walking through the storm of bullets not hurt as if they are god are we still seeing a 2008 movie with all these technical heights achieved so no more words on this pathetic and downgrade movie but a sincere request to senior actors from their fanbr br dear anil kapoor  akshay kumar if possible please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out as artists of such stature you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers people still clap for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively i think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it hampers the reputation of all associated with the movie the actors and the production house both

7,this movie really is a mixed bag on the one hand the story and concept of the movie are really good tense and have some nice plot twists in it but than again on the other hand it all is told very slow without style and uninvolved still i regard just cause as an above average thriller simply because of the fine castbr br maybe sean connery was miscast in his role i mean he isnt really that believable as a the main hero and father of a young daughter played by a still very young scarlett johansson by the way and husband of kate capshaw i feel that he simply was too old for the role to be really credible in it however sean connerey is of course a great actor and that is the only reason why he is still able to carry the movie as good as he does but he of course is helped by a very solid supporting cast that consists out of actors like laurence fishburne blair underwood ned beatty hope lange lynne thigpen and ed harris all actors are really good but some of them are highly underused at the same time which is a real shame as well as a missed opportunity especially ed harris is just totally great in his role as a psychopathic serial killer hes truly chilling and acting superbly normally he doesnt play this ruthless chilling sort of roles in movies so he really surprises with his role in this one his performance alone is already more than enough reason to watch this movie however due to the fact that the story is told without much style and too formulaic none of the characters in the movie really work out well because it feels all too distantbr br it really is the way of storytelling that kills all the movie its fine potential arne glimcher directs the movie with little style and keeps the pace too low at times because of this we as viewers never really get involved with the story or any of its charactersbr br it really is too bad for just cause had more than enough potential a fine cast and a slick story with some unexpected twists and turns in it in which nothing is what it seems the cast and story are the only reason why this movie is still an above average thriller that will probably still please the fan of the genre it however is an eternal shame that the movie is lacking in its story telling and style or else this movie could had been a real classic in its genrebr br 710

5,a 14 year old girl develops her first serious crush on the 17 year old boy that lives near by while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy in comparison to her older sister that is the simple premise of this beautiful poetic coming of age film from director robert mulligan mulligan is famous for previously directing summer of 42 in 1971 and to kill a mockingbird in 1962 two giants of the coming of age genre here he directs newcomers in the principal roles reese witherspoon in her film debut as the 14 year old girl emily warfield as the older sister jason london as court the 17 year old boy reese witherspoon is astonishingly good in her film debut displaying every emotion that a 14 year old girl feels in experiencing young love and hurt never striking a false note warfield and london are both equally good as well the film accurately depicts each adolescents thoughts or feelings in regard to love with heartfelt sensitivity never crossing over into maudlin excess even once kudos to the autobiographical screenplay from jenny wingfield this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally dishonest or sensationalist the music is wonderfully simple accentuating the tone and mood from scene to scene but never becoming intrusive the beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director freddie francis who was in his 70s when this was shot tess harper and sam waterston play the girls parents with dead aim accuracy for 1957 caring strict and emotionally simple gail strickland is good also as the boys mother there are feelings to sort out lessons to learn and truths to face in this sweetnatured film that packs an emotional wallop to date this is robert mulligans last film this is one of the very best films of 1991  of stars
7,evening is the beautiful story of the flawed love of a mother the movie split in time is magically shot amazingly acted and has a touching script vanessa redgrave plays anne grant lord a woman sunsetting out of life lying in her bed her mind remembering and misfiring she recalls her first mistake claire danes plays the young anne giving a youthful vitality to dying bed ridden woman daughters nina toni collette and constance natasha richardson try to decipher the real story from the disheartening dementia her first mistake revolves around harris arden patrick wilson the man her best friend lila mamie gummer deeply loved the daughters must come to terms with their mothers past and their futures the cast is glowing in evening the collective acting energy of this movie could have powered the equipment for the production of this entire film i am so glad to see claire danes working again especially in this role she is so young and alive fully living the joys mistakes and heartbreak of young annes first mistake this is a true feat when you realize she is playing a woman dying in bed when her life overwhelms her you can feel her desire to crack and her hopeless hope that she wont some of her facial expressions grinded on me a little but over all her performance was so radiant i was left with that only as a side note toni collette continues to prove that you can be a powerful actress without being a super model she plays the black sheep of the family a little lost nina finds a great deal of strength in her mothers mistake collette delicately avoids creating a cruel character who revels in the mistakes of her mother instead choosing the wiser path of learning from her mothers mistakes there is a great deal of infighting between nina and her sister constance their fights remind me of ones i have with my sister all the time mamie gummer who plays annes youthful best friend is wonderful her character is stuck between her heart and her status in society even when she is crying and her heart is breaking she is incredibly regal and charming i cant wait to see her act in something else in the future vanessa redgraves performance is very hard for me to describe her talent at making her mental status ambiguous without being wacko or even especially tragic is why it is so powerful the audience does not know if she is making up the story because she is slipping away or if these events truly happened physically and emotionally speaking redgrave is acting in a box not much physical space and limited emotional range might have been a stunner to a lesser actress but she makes the limitations work for her i was constantly amazed the movie is definitely womanfocused but the men in the movie are not just accessories patrick wilson is mesmerizing as harris it is no wonder that everyone in the movie is in love with him i sure was buddy wittenborn is lilas brother spiraling out of control hugh dancy spirals buddy out of control without sending his acting down the drain glen close has my favorite scene in the movie it reminded me of the famous scene from monsters ball it is terrible and jaw dropping grief i was utterly stunned the one acting disappointment was natasha richardson while her fight scenes were memorable most of her acting reeks of melodrama it would have suited her to take an acting bath before we had to breathe her stink its a good thing she wasnt in charge of the visuals the visuals of the movie are sparkling cinematographer gyula pados couldnt make a film richer in color light so perfectly matched to mood and emotion the visual concepts of the flash back sequences are powerful and resonating there were many scenes that could have been stopped printed mounted and sold as art i admit it i cried evening is a powerful movie evening is defiantly a chick flick but a really great chick flick if you want to impress a woman with a movie choice pick evening
7,as a young boy i always sort of hated cinderella since i was outvoted by my two sisters when my parents were considering what disney movie to buy i wanted dumbo but my sisters won out and we got cinderella they thoroughly enjoyed the movie while i sulked in the back of the room playing with my star wars action figuresbr br a lot has changed since then my love of the disney theme parks landed me an internship at walt disney world and i now have two young nieces i like to showcase disney to them as much as i can and we recently watched cinderella together with my newfound appreciation for all that is disney i watched cinderella with a new perspective and was impressed with what i sawbr br from the beginning of the movie though i didnt quite understand why cinderella was trapped in such a horrible predicament why was she such a slave to her stepfamily and why couldnt she just run away i wasnt too sympathetic to cinderella but as the story progressed i found myself becoming immersed in the story maybe the eyecatching animation or the funloving characters drew me in or maybe it was the timeless songs listening to songs like bibbidybobbidyboo and a dream is a wish your heart makes sort of whisked me back to the theme parks i can picture myself in that carefree and fun atmosphere while looking at the aweinspiring cinderella castlebr br something about this movie just evokes the magic of disney that may make many people scoff but go to the magic kingdom and see all the little girls dressed up like cinderella that are excited to be in this fantasy world and youll know what im talking about the images of cinderella and the glass slipper  as well as mickey mouse winnie the pooh and tinkerbell  embody why disney is one of the most beloved companies in the entire worldbr br while cinderella may not be the strongest story it is sort of iconic in disney and movie history it represents that fun idealistic and fantasylike wonderment we held when we were kids i imagine this movie holds a lot of meaning to many many people out there it may not be my favorite disney movie but it does represent all that i love and admire about the companybr br my imdb rating 1010 my yahoo grade a outstanding

3,i saw this movie when i was a child it blew me away this was before the days of television so a movie of this magnitude could send a young kid into orbit it so impressed me that i went to see this movie for twelve consecutive days the special effects used at this time were far ahead of its time sabu was a real delight as was rex ingram as the genie i found myself singing i want to be a sailor for months after the film left town i would recommend this movie to any and everyone i forgot to mention conrad veidt who was as villainous a character as youd ever want to meet also june duprez was never lovelier than she was in this picture the color was outstanding give this movie an aaa
0,steven seagal appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in closeup to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources to pick on the technical flaws  silver fa18s and f14s take of from a carrier for an airstrike and miraculously become camouflaged f16s for the actual strike  would give this movie more credibility than it deserves suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear in a lightning wipe which presumably is available to all users of final cut pro putting all your creativity into your own credit puts michael keusch in the same category as marcel mandu
1,all this talk about this being a bad movie is nonsense as a matter of fact this is the best movie ive ever seen its an excellent story and the actors in the movie are some of the best i would not give criticism to any of the actors that movie is the best and it will always stay that way
3,i have read with great interest the only available comment made before mine on this movie and i would first like to say that i understand the point of view of the previous user who commented on this movie very well viewed from an israeli perspective i can very well imagine that this movie touches upon very sensitive issues and that the slightest detail can have a great importance for a viewer who is more or less directly concerned by the events depicted in this movie what i would like to say is that distortion was shown at a film festival in geneva in november 2005 festival cinma tout cran where it won the award of the audience prix du publicin french for what affects me i liked the nervous camera work of mr bouzaglo who in my opinion portrayed an atmosphere of extreme tension and uneasiness in the movie very well and i think that most of the swiss viewers appreciated this in the movie this perspective however might seem totally alien to an israeli viewer but not so surprising when it comes to swiss viewers because switzerland is a country which has never been subject to any terrorist attack it therefore comes as no surprise that the audience in geneva judged this film with a much more detached perspectivei would also like to quote what mr bouzaglo said when he was interviewed by a geneva newspaper im translating from french after 50 years of living here and after undergoing all this violence we may ask ourselves if it is still possible to remain normalwe might sometimes think that it would be easier to commit suicide than to go on living we are like the characters in my movieon the edge of the edge this is the reason why the private detective who is somehow voyeur is the happiest character in the movie because he earns a living thanks to the system he takes advantage of this situation this is in substance the main thing that i and the swiss public in my opinion pointed out in this movie and that we did not pay attention to some inconsistencies regarding the characters in the movie which the precedent reviewer pointed out with great accuracy and humor so to sum up different countrydifferent perspective but i think that this is somehow great because it reassures me for what affects the future of cinema that is to say that it well never be subject to a unique of formatted way of thinking

6,when i was 16 i saw the documentary a funny thing happened on the way to the moon i actually liked and believed in it for a couple of years but then i grew up and began to think and when i had sought more information this is more info from reel sources and nonbiased sources when i started at university not so long ago i asked an assistantprofessor in astronomy about these conspiracy theories what he said shocked me he said that all those theories where lies that baffled me i did not believe it first but then he presented evidence for his claims he quickly debunked most of the theories about the subject humans did not go to the moon the most outrages claim was that the apollocraft could not travel through the vanallenradiationbelt without the crew perishing from radiation the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminumantiradiationalloy it is not that wellknown and the exact specifications are a secret and why is it a secret well why should they reveal it back then if they where in a space race with the russians then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiationbr br and then there is the biggest evidence of all the moon stones when the apollomissions did go to the moon they brought back many rocks from the moon to give to geologists and similar scientists who are documenting all things about the moon these rocks and stones are in fact from the moon because the internal basic elements which all matter consist of are also made of special isotopes that are different from quarry to quarry land to land and especially planet from planet the isotopes of these rocks and stones have been proved that they do not come from earth the astronauts brought home hundreds of kilograms of these rocks all of them have been proved to have come from outside earth and from the same planet ergo the moonlandings where not fake nasa did go to another planet the moon though it is not a planet but a satellite to a planet a moon duuh these rocks have been distributed to laboratories and universities all around the world it has been proved humans did go to the moon  it is a fact prontobr br but i do not worry most conspiracytheorists are generally unemployed and uneducated that is mostly why they do not know or lie about these facts the fact remains humans did walk on the moon
4,bashki should be congratulated for attempting to convert one of the great works of english fiction into a movie and then slapped silly for this attempt the animation was poor the characters looked ridiculous the music was overwhelmingly blaring and the film was a ramshackle blitz through the first book and a half of tolkiens masterpiece i can still remember my sheer disappointment and loathing for the movie when i first saw it now i realize that any attempt to convert a book into a movie is bound to fail in many ways simply because of the medium but this movie regardless of the source of the story is just plain pathetic bashki is capable of much more
7,the original with barbara stanwyk is saved only by stanwyks performance the story and the other performances are too sickeningly sweet and the film itself is too dated to be really enjoyed today bette midlers version is much more interesting she is stella claire an independent freespirited single woman who gets pregnant and refuses help from her boyfriend stephen collins or her friend john goodman in an underrated performance she raises her daughter jenny played so sweetly by trini alvarado and then comes to the conclusion that jennys father can do better for her and ultimately makes a lifealtering decision through out the film there are plenty of laughs tears and memorable moments mostly between midler and alvarado marsha mason costars as jennys wouldbe stepmother who though wealthy turns out to be a very good influence on her if you like midler goodman or just good films with plenty of emotion youll enjoy bette midlers version of stella

1,this is an excellent show i had a us history teacher in high school that was much like this there are many facts in history that are not quite true and mr wuhl points them out very well in a way that is unforgettablebr br mr wuhl is teaching a class of film students but history students and even the general public will appreciate the witty way that he uncovers some very well known fallacies in the history of the world and strive to impress them upon that brains of his students use of live actors performing skits is also very entertaining br br i highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the history they learned as a child turned upside down
4,i remember parker posey on as the world turns before she became the queen of the independent movies in this film posey shows her potential as a top fledged actress in this film with supporting cast that includes omar townsend as moustafa a lebanese immigrant who works as a falafel salesman on the street who aspires to become a teacher the supporting cast features a wonderful actress who plays her godmother and only family relative as judy the librarian who is old fashioned dedicated and menopausal posey as mary learns that she has to grow up and mature losing her librarian clerk position makes her realize how much she misses it as a place in her life marys life is surrounded by friends in the lower east side village of new york city before it became gentrified with yuppies this film is quite good for an independent and i have come to enjoy parker posey as mary as well as other characters in other films
7,i was very unimpressed with cinderella and jungle book but this is possibly worse than both titles first of all i didnt like the animation very saturdaymorningcartoon only worse in some scenes i liked some of the characters namely thunderbolt and patch but the other characters like cruella were mediocre cruella was truly villainous in the original but she lost her quality in the sequel what she said was nothing at all to write home about and her animation was kind of ugly also her artist companion lars was a joke to be honest with you and roger seemed to have quit smoking overnight the voice talents were very good though especially barry bostwick as thunderbolt with the exception of jodi benson the accent ruined it for me there were some good moments but the whole plot seemed bloated for me and highly suggestive of an extended tv episode all in all a hugely disappointing sequel to the most memorable of the 60s disney movies along with jungle book sorry i can only give this a 310 it just wasnt my cup of tea bethany cox
4,this ambitious film suffers most from writerdirector paul thomas andersons delusions of grandeur highly derivative of much better material altmans nashville lumets network this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere a couple of misguided detours along the way an embarrassing musical interlude a biblical plague dont help matters neither does the uneven level of performances especially bad william h macy whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether julianne moore for her unconvincing angst and how many times must we see john c reillys sad sack shtick chicago and the hours will suffice tom cruise comes off well by comparison  his misogynist foulmouthed holy roller was rather amusing speaking of foul mouths the script was so loaded with f bombs they lost their impact in no time dont even talk about that awful soundtrack full of insipid and annoying vocals by aimee mann her extended rendition of one a maudlin number to begin with drove me to distraction at the start of the film i should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours by which time id been pushed to the brink of hell one redeeming feature which i havent seen mentioned in other reviews is the best performance in the bunch by unknown melora walters in the role of claudia the damaged coke fiend bent on selfdestruction her credibility exceeded all others by far this film took itself way too seriously and just didnt know when to end
0,there is so much of worth in this movie that it is hard to know where to begin with praise let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrayal by reese witherspoon that her performance stands out in the excellent cast is praise indeed robert mulligan has seldom disappointed those of us who have admired his work every frame of the man in the moon is evidence of film making at its best
0,a difficult film to categorize i was never giving it 110 concentration  consequently as simple as the plot appeared i couldnt say for certain exactly who was doing what amongst the american fbi characters  what their roles were nor could i take the irwins seriously as film characters when their lines  scenes were all in the style of one of his shows not acted outbr br this is nothing more than a glorified episode of a discovery tv show with a largely insignificant sub plot going on which just seemed to get in the way however as any irwin show is always worth a watch this film is well worth a look too but not on christmas day talking of which ive better things to do too than be on herebr br a high 410

0,a most recommendable masterpiece not only for the underlying themes of the story but also for the unmatchably brilliant and ingenious picture work of angelopoulos not to mention the acting of giants mastroianni and moreau and the remarkable character play by ilias logothethis gregory karrs performance may seem overshadowed by his tough partners at first stance but in fact he perfectly plays his character which is revealed in his very last scene with the girl khrysikou and the man mastroianni albeit hinted beforehand hence the spoilerbr br get your expectations straight its an art movie in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention not for spending free time but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as in reading a book or attending a concert due to the overall photographic style large screen viewing is recommendedbr br dialogues are used sparingly but the film includes in addition to the standard greek and english speaking fragments spoken in albanian kurdish and turkish which will be attractive for those who are charmed by the beauty in hearing various languages
2,dont get me wrong i love action and revenge flicks ive seen many of them since i was a kid including dolph lundgrens latest the mechanik which is quite good and tony scott certainly know how to use a camera and even might be a genius shooting and editing filmsbr br but with man on fire and even more then with domino scott shows that rather than using his filmmaking genius skills intelligently he uses it puposelessly to show off and compensate a lack of substance that his material doesnt offer him man of fire is close to hours and half when it really should have been at least an hour lessbr br the way scott shot and edited this film also makes you wonder if he really wants you the audience to sit through his film because his constant camera moves and flashes really are a torture for the eye and makes you wanna leave the theater or turn it off after minutes into itbr br at times where the mpaa and studios have questionable attitudes regarding ratings violence and making pg13 movies i find also suspicious that a 70 million movie is made of a bmovie script with a character who cuts fingers puts a bomb in a mans ass and blows a guys hand with a shotgun all this to avenge the death of a little girl who isnt even dead go figure then why a studio will pass a better script because of the language or violence thus said
0,the fox and the child is the new film by french director luc jacquet who brought us the oscarwinning documentary march of the penguins it focuses around a young girl wonderfully played by bertille nolbruneau and her blooming friendship with a foxbr br there are some truly mesmerizing moments here badgers mucking about a lynx chasing the fox through a snowlittered forest one scene in particular when the fox is being tormented by a pack of wolves is quite intense and even frightening at times however theres simply not quite enough of thembr br beautifully shot the cinematography is dazzling the bubbly kind of look of the film is wonderful its undeniably a very lush productionbr br the english version is narrated by kate winslet but what little dialogue there already is has been very poorly dubbed the score is also far too fluffy or at least it is for my liking and the screenplay while subtle seemingly jumps from one scenario to another ultimately leaving me almost baffledbr br while theres a nice moral at the heart of the film and the rather quiet performance from nolbruneau is quite lovely the real star is the fox those captivating moments focusing solely around our furry little friend are tremendous however again theres simply not nearly enough of thembr br  to keep up to date with all the latest in film including reviews news discussions and more be sure to visit wwwmybluraycomau
6,br br get your brewskies out and enjoy this flawed action flick speakmans considerable kempo skill nice spin kicks decent with the sticks  poor couch is the only redeeming quality of a movie that just cries bad acting the plot isnt half bad just executed pretty poorly but if youre seeing this movie for anything other than martial arts youre missing the boat entirely and for a movie that is supposed to take place in koreatown way way too few korean actors even extras
1,i was going to give it an but since you people made 65 out of a lot better votes i had to up my contribution the river styx was pure genius sure woody was his perennial stuff but at least his role was appropriate the first half hour was really hilarious and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch the dialog was clever enough and woodys card tricks at the parties along with the reaction from the upper crust were fun to watch this was much better than the newspaper critics made it sound out to be and a plus a little sorcerers apprentice to go along with it and of course did you notice that johansen is getting a bit frumpy charles dance is always entertaining as was hugh jackman
7,the lady from shanghai is well known as one of hollywoods most troubled productions welles original cut was taken away by the producers and cut to ribbons this made the already muddled mystery story even more difficult to keep track of they post dubbed a good amount of his dialog because of the density of the irish accent and the dubbing is all too apparent and poorly done most disastrous of all welles and his on screen and real life leading lady rita hayworth were falling apart in their relationship and their tumultuous chemistry comes through on screenbr br fortunately this is all overcome by just how fantastic orson welles direction is he makes the film incredibly stylish and atmospheric  every scene just seems to be breathing down your back from the screen also the characters and scenes are so bizarre they border on dreamlike and surreal this sense of weirdness elevates scenes that are often found in these films such as the courtroom sequences in the middle i typically find courtroom dramas a bore but welles direction and quirky touches make them just as fascinating as everything else the ending at the carnival reminds one of david lynch almostbr br the acting here is also very good despite their failing relationship welles and hayworth both give decent performances  their interactions however are just a bit lacking everyone else is superb and delightful to watch though especially everett sloane and glenn anders the lady from shanghai obviously has its problems but its worth watching just to see one of cinemas masters at his finest 810
4,this show was appreciated by critics and those who realized that any similarities between pushing daisies style and anyone elses was not a steal yes ive seen amelie pushing daisies is somewhat similar but still different enough to be original rather there are too few shows on tv that have this kind of quirky charm the greatest similarity is to dead like me but pd comes by that similarity honestly bryan fuller created both shows both shows involve an undead young woman for example this show never stopped being funny and charming and it was always odd yet was consistently humanebr br i must say a word about the conventions of ongoing story lines some people have complained that this show lacked a moral center because in the first and several subsequent episodes ned seems to get away with causing the death of chucks father without consequences of any kind first of all this must be a new definition of without consequences of any kind because in spite of the fact that ned was only a boy and did not realize that he had caused the death of chucks father he nevertheless felt guilty from the moment he realized what he had done further about a dozen episodes into the series ned finally did confess to chuck that he had caused her fathers death with his gift now there are no police to charge people with magically causing one persons death by bringing another person back to life so the questions of absolution and restitution have to be taken up without societal guidance in other words its between ned and chuck who was not inclined to forgive ned anytime soonbr br but this does point out a problem with continuing story lines in network dramas i remember when david carusos character on nypd blue did something wrong and it seemed he got away with itfor a whole yearthen he got caught and was forced to resign from the job and left the show the point is viewers should learn by now and not assume that just because a regular character does something wrong in a single episode and is not caught in that episode that he has gotten away with it there is always next weekand maybe even next year
0,italian horrorsuspense film about a wealthy english lord who cruises pubs and taverns for girls with red hair just like his recently deceased wife evelyn you know he must have really loved his wife because he brings them to his home  a huge rotting castle  and makes them disrobe and then tortures them whips them and kills them the most bizarre aspect of this film for me was that somehow by the films end we see this guy played by antonio de teffe as the hero of the film anyway soon under the advice of his playboy uncle roberto maldera de teffe settles down with a girl he meets at his uncles party she moves in and strange things begin to happen to de teffes fragile state of mind he begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally well just look at the title if you are still curious also family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions poor aunt agathashe looks like she might even be younger than de teffe and they have her in a wheelchair and trying to look old meets her fate in a foxy fashion another man is injected and then buried alive and of course there is a whole explanation as to whyhow evelyn did what she did director emilio miraglia does do some things fairly well the settings in the film are wellsuited for this film though trying to make us believe it is england is ludicrous at best none of the actors look english many having dark black hair and mediterranean complexions and wearing clothes an englishman wouldnt be caught dead in the cars drive on their wrong side of the road but all that notwithstanding the crypt scene was effectively shot and i liked the cheesy resolution too and of course any film with the sultry redheaded erika blanc is always a plus there is a streak of sexual perversion however which i found somewhat appalling with the idea that torturing women was quite alright and healthy in order to relieve one of his mental demons cmon

3,it has taken me a while to watch this version as unfortunately i dont seem to be able to rent it in the video store only the other version but i fell in love with it i was always borderline with the other emma gwenneth and toni collette as they are not british naturally have to put on the accent and well to me it doesnt seem natural it seems put on sorry but dont think toni and gwenneth did a brilliant job there i could not warm to any of the characters but this version is more heart warming and more the type of person i imagined emma to be it is definitely the version i will come back to from now on i was disappointed that mr knightley was not better looking but he is convincing i also like jane fairfax better played by olivia williams i never warmed to her in the movie version but she is better portrayed in this version come to think of it besides mr knightley all characters are better played and a lot less over the top unfortunately both came out around same time and the paltrow version got more publicity pity i also love the new scene at the end well done to kate beckingsale therefore if you are a jane austen fan dont forget to watch this one
2,this movie is great the music with the exception of the very first song in the movie was awesome the story line is awesome too its just basically a wonderfull movie for all ages i found the last battle scene awesome basically this was a great flick
6,this movie made me really mad because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent ive lived in iowa for 29 years and i know that people dont have a southern accent here this movie is about a guy who does meth and i dont know the real plot or what the movie is suppose to be about it has some pretty graphic drug use in it and its really insulting so see these people use meth like it was sugar i lost my brother to meth and this movie makes me sick to my stomach because it glamorizes the drug the movie makes it look cool to use the drug but i was happy at the end when the guy almost made it across the state line i also know that most women who experience a traumatic rape dont want to make love to their boyfriend or husband the next day the movie is just wrong in all directions i would suggest the basketball diaries if i was going to suggest a movie about drugs
0,i can clearly see now why robin hood flopped quickly the first episode of it is probably the worst ever thing bbc has aired the opening scenes were about as intense meaningful and intelligent as two monkeys fighting robin hood had no character and the sword fight was just laughable the worst part of the episode was robin hood snogging some cow clad in makeup at the beginning of the episode  how many people wore eyeliner in the 12th century nobody the series may have improved drastically since then but this first episode quickly put peoples hopes down and is essentially a pile of crp a great hero of england has been disgracedbr br will you tolerate this i wont thats for sure unless the bbc start to understand what is a wise investment 310
6,well what are the odds at the exact right moment that a few redneck amateurscientists discover cave paintings indicating that some type of dinosaur monster might have inhabited the area thousands of years ago a burning meteor crashes into the lake and spontaneously hatches a monsters egg that has been lying there  for over a thousand years i suppose the crater lake monster is a movie that literally must be seen to be believed but you better do so in the company of many friends and a pile of ganja in order to make the wholesome a little bit easier to digest yes this is a terrible film with the utmost ramshackle screenplay imaginable and numerous irrelevant padding interludes that are downright embarrassing but its also irresistibly charming and so clumsily put together that you simply have to cherish some kind of fondness for it half of the film  at least  revolves on the wacky adventures of arnie and mitch these two local yokels own and run a boat renting shop near the lake but spend most of their days picking their noses and quarreling over fascinating stuff like to spell the word bait it is mostly during their prototypic laurel  hardy situations that new puddles of blood or decapitated heads are discovered in the lake steve hanson the heroic but not exactly sharp sheriff is on the case but only if hes not too busy chasing big city thugs traveling through the area halfway through the film there suddenly is an abrupt scene about a thug robbing a liquor store and killing two people in the process this textbook wtf moment appears to take on the complete other side of the country like in new york city or something and has absolutely nothing to do with the events going on at crater lake only like twenty minutes later the robber pops up again in hicksville and theres an exhilarating chase through the woods ending in the dinos hungry muzzle the absurd little details in the crater lake monster are too numerous to mention for example this is probably the only creaturefeature in which the players discover the obligatory gigantic footprint after they already spotted the actual monster the goofs in continuity should be legendary as far as im concerned its like everybody forgot to pay attention to it night turns into twilight into day and back into twilight  all during one and the same diurnal course the monster is undeniably the best aspect about the film especially since its accomplished through good old fashioned and adorable stop motion effects the cute critter is a plesiosaur meaning an aquatic dinosaur looking like a crossbreed between denver the last dinosaur and an alligator crater lake monster is a unique and unforgettable movie experience that i can only encourage to track down the miserable out of 10 rating is just out of principle and because basically this is a very bad film should be put into perspective because i might as well could have given it 10 out of 10 for sheer entertainment value
6,worst mistake of my lifebr br i picked this movie up at target for because i figured hey its sandler i can get some cheap laughs i was wrong completely wrong midway through the film all three of my friends were asleep and i was still suffering worst plot worst script worst movie i have ever seen i wanted to hit my head up against a wall for an hour then id stop and you know why because it felt damn good upon bashing my head in i stuck that damn movie in the microwave and watched it burnand that felt better than anything else ive ever done it took american psycho army of darkness and kill bill just to get over that crap i hate you sandler for actually going through with this and ruining a whole day of my life
5,this has to be one of the worst movies of all time the graphics were horrendous the acting was bmovie and the effects were just plain nintendo 64 qualified you would think that they would put a little more effort into it of course it is a scifi channel movie so you have to expect it to be low rate but this one takes the cake hell im still laughing so as a shakeyourhead in disbelief movie this one does well br br although it appears to have some known actors and actresses in this it is difficult for me to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this movie was worth their time and effort br br the graphics might have been good in the 60s or even early 70s but come on this is 2009 i wont give spoilers out lets just say that if you have played jurassic park on the nintendo 64 you will be very familiar with what you see in this filmbr br it is definitely not worth the hours it took to sit through the thing
1,all of the people reviewing this film and probably many professional film reviewers just dont get it this film was made with matting sequences and art techniques quite like the works of the great czech filmmaker karel zeman if you want to know what im talking about i suggest you get any of zemans films such as the fabulous world of jules verne baron munchausen journey to the beginning of time or on the comet if you are unable to locate a film then read the reviews in amg they will explain the processes used if one were to look at zemans work and try to compare it to any of the other scifi fantasy films of the time viewers probably wouldnt have gotten it then either it is unfair to compare either of these filmmakers styles to the standard technologies of the day because both zemen and hines do not compute they have a style that is unique to them and should be judged for their creativity only if you look at this film from a perspective where you know that he intentionally tried to create a pastiche collage of mattes mixed with live action you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterful job it isnt easy making a bunch of computer cutouts flow i thought that the creatures were also quite good also considering how they were made hines took a great gamble and i think his film will not be fairly judged for years to come someone promoting the film should have tipped the audience off as to what they would be seeing rather than let them blindly go into the theater expecting the usual cg work regarding the actors i think hines also took a page from zemens book in that many of zemens actors were somewhat expressionless at first but became much more engaging as the film and action went on it is totally refreshing to me to have this movie in my library i will watch it for years to come all three great hours of it
1,i grew up on this movie and i can remember when my brother and i used to play in the backyard and pretend we were in carealot now after so many years have passed i get to watch the movie with my daughter and watch her enjoy it if you are parent and you have not watched this movie with your children then you should just so you hold them in your arms and watch them get thrilled over the care bears and carealot the songs especially forever young are very sweet and memorable parents i highly recommend this movie for all kids so they can learn how enjoyable caring for others can be when it comes down to all the trash that is on tv you can raise your children to have the right frame of mind about life with movies like these
1,neil simons the odd couple set up a model for many of his later plays felix unger and oscar madison were the unsuitably paired roommates in the original the former being picky and neat the latter being slovenly and loose simon would rewrite less successfully the play in the 1990s as the new odd couple with female roommates he made it a mixed couple a woman with her daughter and a man in the goodbye girls he also gave it an additional twist in 1973 with the sunshine boys a broadway hit starring jack alberson and sam levine as al lewis and willie clark the aged semiretired vaudevillians here the apartment problem is reduced to a teaming of two men who cant stand each other the 1976 film starred walter matthau as willie and george burns as albr br in actuality al probably does not think totally badly of willie  willie is pathological on the subject of al first al had little habits such as accidentally spitting slightly when pronouncing words beginning with the letter t and slightly jabbing willie with his index finger on stage secondly al retired when his wife died willie was not ready to retire and has been forcing his nephew and agent ben richard benjamin to try to get him jobs in commercials but willie cant remember lines unless they are funny and keeps flubbing them so he rarely is able to stay to the end of a rehearsal for a commercialbr br ben is asked to get the two back together for a live scene of their most famous sketch on a television show about american comedy he does bring al to see willie and the sparks begin flying as neither can figure out what the other is doing and this is just in rehearsal on top of that willie is insisting on changes minor ones but they throw off al such as saying enter when al knocks on the door the initial rehearsal is a failure but ben manages to get them to the taping of the show the question is if they will complete the scene in the finished program or will willie wring als neckbr br the three leads matthau burns and benjamin do very well with the oneliners frequently reminiscent of vaudeville patter example chest painsim getting chest pains uncle willie every thursday i come here and get chest pains so come on fridays benjamin strives to prove his deep affection for his uncle although matthaus rough outer shell makes it difficult he only smooths down when he discusses the glory days of vaudeville matthau has a little better grasp on reality at first than burns who seems senile by his repeating himself  but in actuality matthaus sense of rejection by the world that once applauded him make him less willing to behave properly burns is not senile  he takes things slowly but he seems far happier in accepting his retirementbr br i call this a final voyage of discovery for our modern lewis and clark al and willie transcend their old skits as they gradually end up realizing that they have more in common in their old age than they thought even the irascible willie admits that al may be to him a pain in the ass but he was a funny manbr br burns was not the original choice for the part of al lewis supposedly dale of the team smith and dale jack benny was benny probably would have done a good job but illhealth forced him out he died in 1975 burns whose last involvement in any film was in the solid gold cadillac in 1956 as the narrator turned in such a fine performance that he got the oscar for best supporting actor and was to have a career in movies in the next decade in such films as oh god oh god you devil and going in style he died in 1996 age 100 having proved that he was more than just a brilliant straight man for his wife gracie allan
1,times are tough for angel town gangs rule with an iron fist and for reasons mostly unknown mainly due to embarrassing writing the gangs want a street kid martine to join the gangs so they beat him up everyday however due to the presence of an olympic kickboxer olivier worlds lamest actor gruner named jacques hope is on the way angel town is seriously one of the most inept message movies ever made and ive seen my share it seems to consist of the idea that all gang infested neighborhoods need are french kickboxers who cant act worst of all there are so many awkward moments its just truly hilarious best of all comes from the exchange between gruner and aragon which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing is to wit you like the fighting olivier grabs his asian best friend in a headlock i could kill him right when i want him dead he dies the reason why i dont want him dead is because im afraid of him and i know that if i kill him his son and wife will kill me thats why he doesnt die br br of course the fact that its wrong to kill someone let alone your best friend is of course left out of the equation oddbr br however dont let me make this sound that i hated this movie far from it its so terrible its priceless the biggest laughs come at the end in the disastrous finale which sees grunner going one on one with gangmembers who the films biggest logic gapdecline the use of pistols also a handicapped vietnam vet helps out by shooting his machine gun at the gangs while gruner kickboxes the rest all of this set to the sound of horrible mexican accents and surreal energy that make this one memorable for fans of cinematic trash such as thisbr br the other treat about this movie is that for some reason olivier gruner never attends college despite thats the main reason hes here in the states and not in france getting it on with his girlfriend in a graveyard in the films awkward beginning angel town is without a doubt a failure on all conceivable levels but if you laugh at moronic martial arts movies with insane levels of action that make no sense on any level this is the perfect movie for you on the other hand make sure to down tequila like the laughable opening song details aint no mercy in angel town br br  out of 4bad
7,this animated feature a coproduction between ireland belgium and france deals with what is surely one of the oddest subject ever for a movie the creation in the 9th century of a famous illuminated manuscript the book of kells in this fantastic retelling of that story a prepubescent boy named brendan living in a monastery ruled by his uncle a stern abbot who is worried preparing the defenses of the abbey from the impending attack by the feared vikings must get into the forbidding surrounding forest to find the materials that a master illuminator named aidan needs to finish the book to do that task in the forest he unexpectedly finds the help of a friendly fairy named aislinggorgeously and delicately drawn by hand there is some computer animation in a few key passages in a manner that wants to resemble both medieval and traditional celtic art and with a very creative use of color and all sorts of geometric shapes this film is relentlessly strange but is a good strange not of the off putting variety but of the eye opening sort if one were to nitpick  beyond some anachronisms like an african monk in 9th century ireland  one would have to say that the blend of catholic mysticism with celtic paganism in this movie never really coalesce and the comic relief is sometimes a bit too broad thats why i cannot give them the highest ranking but these are minor problems with an otherwise delightful and superbly imaginative film

5,just the kind of movie i love some very good british actors as well as the one and only sharon stone catherine tramell stone masterfully manipulates a well educated group of peoples lives playing on their frailties to collect experiences to write a murder mystery book she plays the female psychopath quite well while using her ample sex appeal to convincingly portray what could be considered one of the ultimate black widows tramell is use to dark places within society and freely partakes in sadomasochistic flings in the never visit after dark side of town from the beginning there is nothing short of an r rating here from the dialog alone stone could also be described as a sort of female hannibal lecter an emotionless femme fatal without the meal plan

1,the sentinel represents everything about the soullessness of hollywood and the saddening lack of imagination present in so many movies these days i cannot possibly think of one good thing about it its all so generic so factorymade and so lazy assembled that it really only exists as an infomercial on how to make money from the unsuspecting undeserving publicbr br a plot about a secret service agent planning to assassinate the prez could well be entertaining if handled by a good director or caring cast that is douglas is the one who is framed basinger is the first lady with whom he is having an affair an undeveloped unresolved plot contrivance sutherland is the best pal who believes his guilty because there would be no movie if he didnt and longoria is nothing a woman with a fortune of maybelline andthats it i guess there are less requirements for women when entering the secret service as usual in a film like this the role of the prez himself is nothing more than a tool a token and is very badly writtenbr br clark johnsons he who gave us the equally as pathetic swat back in 2003 mechanical direction lacks any kind of signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap tvmovie douglas basinger and sutherland look incredibly bored and phonein their performances from afar eva longoria the most overexposed woman of the 21st century is basically only in this to attract to the desperate housewives audience her role is 100 pointless and she does absolutely nothing to further the plot or add to character development she barely has lines to rub together a truly shameless marketing ploybr br if youre a glutton for punishment then dont let me stop you but it is time and money you wont be getting back
7,fans of the hbo series tales from the crypt are going to love this moh episode those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic ec comics were based on will recognize this one right off the batbr br underrated indie favorite martin donovan also an excellent writer  coauthor of the screenplays for apartment zero and death becomes her is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way he could play a really nice if misunderstood guynextdoor or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness in the case of right to die he takes the latter approach and it definitely worksbr br donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist robin sydney much to the displeasure of his inconsolable unforgiving spouse abbey julia anderson when the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of making up and shes horribly burned in a fire hes reluctant to pull the plug on her not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy corbin bernsen looking the worse for wear these days br br but abbeys never been one to give up without a fight and thats where the ectheme of the episode comes in cuckolded husbands  and wives  have always been the genres favorite subject matter for some spooky and ooky supernatural shenanigans and this case is definitely no exception if anything the rampedup quotient of sex and gore must have bill gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewherebr br and thats not to mention that john espositos original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist you dont realize as youre watching that you only know half the story until close to the endthink what lies beneath with more guts and gazongas and youre therebr br not a bad effort but not the best of the lot either at least rob schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed as with most moh episodes this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment so the extremely squeamish need not apply

0,seriously crappy moviebr br first off the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehousefurniture store the bad cop takes a girl which they had pulled over into the warehouses attic while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there the bad cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag and the newbie cop doesnt think there are any problems but he still wonders what was in the bag so he asks gets a bullshit response and then he thinks everything is ok for nowbr br the bad cop repeats this process and even once with a tit scene made it slightly better but eventually people start to catch on which took awhile considering how fing obvious it was one girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies like ya do now the bad cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch and then he gets rid of the duffelbagged bodybr br since she had the oogeyboogey magic put on her she comes back with lots of eyeshadow on which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie also the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become eyeshadow monsters some of the girls meet up with a dude who is apparently a currency specialist and he offers them a ride they look normal to him apparently but when the girls see other people such as the one girls husband he freaks out because she is hideous some people freak out but others dont even notice massive plot holebr br so to wrap it up the eyeshadow monsters kill the bad cop who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene it was as though they were trying to prep us for a sequel like anyone would want to see part of this cow dropping
2,the secret of kells is an independent animated feature that gives us one of the fabled stories surrounding the book of kells an illuminated manuscript from the middle ages featuring the four gospels of the new testament i didnt know that this book actually exists but knowing it now makes my interpretation and analysis much a lot easier there are a few stories and ideas floating around about how the book came to be who wrote it and how it has survived over 1000 years this is one of thembr br we are introduced to brendan an orphan who lives at the abbey of kells in ireland with his uncle abbot cellach voiced by brendan gleeson abbot cellach is constructing a massive wall around the abbey to protect the villagers and monks brendan is not fond of the wall and neither are the other monks they are more focused on reading and writing something abbot cellach does not have time for anymore he fears the northmen those who plunder and leave towns and villages empty and burnt to the groundbr br one day a traveler comes from the island of iona near scotland it is brother aidan a very wise man who carries with him a special book that is not yet finished abbot cellach grants him permission to stay and brendan buddies up with him aidan has special plans for brendan first he needs ink for the book but he requires specific berries the only way to get them is to venture outside the walls and into the forest an area off limits to brendan seeing that he is the only chance for aidan to continue his work he decides to sneak out and return with the berries before his uncle notices his absencebr br in the forest brendan meets ashley the protector of the forest she allows brendan passage to the berries and along the way becomes akin to his company she warns him of the looming danger in the dark and not to foil with it there are things worse than vikings out there from there brendan is met with more challenges with the book and the looming certainty of invasionbr br i like the story a lot more now that i know what it is about knowing now what the book of kells is and what it contains the animation makes perfect sense im sure you have seen pictures or copies of old texts from hundreds of years ago with frilly borders colorful pictures and extravagant patterns creatures and writings adorning the pages much like the opening frames of disneys the sword in the stone the animation here contains a lot of similar designs and patterns it creates a very unique viewing experience where the story and the animation almost try to outdo each otherbr br i couldnt take my eyes off of the incredible detail this is some of the finest 2d animation i have seen in years its vibrant stimulating and full of life the characters are constantly surrounded by designs doodles and patterns in trees on the walls and in the air just floating around it enhances the filmbr br the story is satisfactory although i think the ending could have been strung out a little more with a runtime of only 75 minutes i think there could have been something special in the final act it doesnt give a lot of information nor does it allude to the significance of the book we are reminded of its importance but never fully understand we are told that it gives hope but never why or how that was really the only lacking portion of the film otherwise i thought the story was interesting though completely outdone by the animationbr br i guess thats okay to a certain degree the animation can carry a film so far before it falls short the story lacks a few parts but it is an interesting take on a fascinating piece of history i would recommend looking up briefly the book of kells just to get an idea of what myself and this film are talking about i think it will help your viewing experience a lot more this a very impressive and beautifully illustrated film that should definitely not be missed
2,i hated this movie so much i remember it vividly it is not even funny any movie that relies on unfunny sex jokes and racism humor does not deserve the money it costs to make it in the first half hour rob schneider drinks a carton of rancid milk all i could think was he deserves it for making such a bad movie dont waste your time or money on this one

5,after 21 movies and three years of working in hollywood bette davis finally got a role she claimed as her own and which put her as a force to be reckoned with as mildred rogers davis burst forth with a completely unsympathetic role of a slutty waitress who becomes the target of leslie howards affections and already eager to sink her teeth into a role like this she had no qualms of the awful things her character was meant to do throughout the course of the film and the awful transformation she would undergo it also has been widely noted that her performance here one of the few things that makes this slightly uneven movie watchable has been the one to remember even after two remakes and the scenes where she rips into howard have made cinema historybr br at circa 85 minutes the story moves at a nice pace telling the story of philip carey howard as his life crosses that of the destructive mildred rogers over and over againbr br howard and davis chemistry is all but nonexistent  davis sustained in an interview much later in life she personally didnt care much for howards iciness towards her and that helped her act even worse in character towards him as mildred all the same the two seem awkward with one another their scenes together remain stiff only salvaged by the ferocious acidity davis brings to her lines and her own nervous presence then again cromwells direction has a certain stiltedness about itself that fails to come through at times  he tries to fill in some space whenever davis is not there with dissolves and montages indicating the passing of time a calendar superimposed over a changing frances dee all much in the style back then this was before technicalities and complicated camera angles came into being and in essence the visual story is a simplified bare essentials translation of the somerset maughams novel  which is saying a lot since at 600 pages of human bondage would have been indeed hard to film even thenbr br storywise it feels that philip carey may be something of a glutton for punishment since there is no discernible sexual attraction between he and mildred and to compound that mildred never hides her displeasure from the getgo howards performance never seems to go through much external emotion  his eyes are constantly sad his expression never veers too far away from lost he could almost be a distant cousin to william hurt in the accidental tourist  dejected hurt and absolutely passive but this is possibly a part of his character and the reason he fails to see that other women played by kay johnson and frances dee are making themselves vulnerable to unrequited affections interestingly johnsons norah once she realizes carey will never fall for her is the one who sums the story up with her observation that people are bound to other people  she is bound to carey as carey is bound to mildred and mildred herself is bound to miller or men who fit the role of provider in her short but memorable scene shes the one who holds the essence of the storys moral
0,office work especially in this era of computers multifunctional copy machines email voice mail snail mail and temps is territory ripe with satirical possibilities a vein previously tapped in such films as clockwatchers and office space and very successfully this latest addition to the temphumor pool however haiku tunnel directed by josh kornbluth and jacob kornbluth fails to live up to its predecessors and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door waiting for a chance to sneak in unfortunately for the audience that chance never comes so what you get is a nice try but as the man once said no cigarbr br 	as the narratorstar of the film josh kornbluth playing josh kornbluth points out in the opening frames in a monologue delivered directly into the camera this story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of san franclisco its an innovative if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer and not all that funny it is however a harbinger of what is to follow all of which like the disclaimer just isnt all that funnybr br 	kornbluth plays kornbluth an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a temp its a job that suits him and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time but when he goes to work for a lawyer bob shelby warren keith he does too good a job on the first day and shelby dispatches head secretary marlina damore helen shumaker to kornbluth to persuade him to go perm the thought of working full time for the same company though initially strikes fear in the heart of kornbluth but he caves in and signs on for the position hes nervous about it but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence which of course they would never do with a temp and if things get too rough he has seventeen important letters hes typed up that now just have to be mailed out to fall back on hes been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part and he needs that something easy to do in reserve in case it all gets to be too much for him these are important letters however and by the end of the week kornbluth still has them in reserve on his desk and it doesnt take a genius to figure out that when shelby finds out about it kornbluths days as the fairhaired boy are going to be over and quickbr br 	the brothers kornbluth who not only directed but along with john bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film should have taken a page out of the ben stiller book of comedy where it says if you play it straight they will laugh but they didnt and the audience wont because in comedy even looking at it as objectively as possible when the main character as well as most of the supporting characters in this case plays funny as in he knows hes being funny he never is and thats exactly what kornbluth does here so rather than being funny he comes across as insincere and pretentious a grievous error in judgment on the part of the kornbluths because by allowing it they sabotaged their own movie br br 	in trying to discern exactly why this movie doesnt work it comes down to two basic reasons the directing which if not necessarily bad is at least careless and secondly the performances beginning with that of josh kornbluth quite simply kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here unlike stiller or even steve martin both of whom use selfdeprecating humor very effectively kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he the real kornbluth is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character and being unable to get past that does him in as well as the film rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with with an inexplicably narrow focus given the potential of the rich subject matter its easy to understand why this one just doesnt flybr br 	the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby whose subtle delivery is convincing and which in and of itself is fairly humorous the effectiveness of it is diminished however inasmuch as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project br br 	shumaker and sarah overman julie faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances which are commendable if not entirely memorable they at least make their scenes watchable and overman even manages to elevate kornbluths performance if only momentarily but its still not enough to save the day or the filmbr br 	the supporting cast includes amy resnick mindy brian thorstenson clifford june lomena davonne joe bellan jimmy the mail clerk with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking harry shearer as the orientation leader a role that begs for an answer to the question what was he thinking when he agreed to this in any work environment there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someones comedic cannon and the films depicting said situations will always be with us the good ones see paragraph one may even become classics in their own right haiku tunnel however will

6,i rented this movie from blockbuster on a whim  i like alan arkin and the cover was catching  i read the back and knew right away it was going to either be the best or the worst movie i have ever seen  i guess i got lucky  i laughed from beginning to end  alan arkin brings a great character to this movie i have since bought a used rental copy for my own collection and watch it all the time  i have recommeded this movie to loads of people and they all enjoyed it as much as i did  i see complaints about the menus and dvd functions  but it doesnt take away from the movie  the disk was authored for blockbuster exculsivley which is why they didnt allow you to skip past the previews  aside from that you shouldnt let the functions of the dvd to deterr you from watching the excellent film
6,new york i love you finally makes it to our shores but its 10 short stories on love somehow didnt find reason enough to be released over valentines probably due to the fact that this years festival also falls on lunar new year and with that comes the usual lny blockbuster films from the likes of jackie chan no not the spy next door and local filmmaker jack neo who has traditionally released his latest film over that period to resounding success so why fix a formula that hasnt been brokenbr br continuing in concept where paris je taime had begun in spawning the city of love franchise shanghai will be next so says the end of the closing credits here the buzz here is definitely about the intertwining stories set in one of the cities of the world to allow for various interpretations from filmmakers all over to come up with stories based on love as a theme although someone probably forgot to tell scarlett johansson some of the finer points in the sandbox ground rules and her short was unceremoniously dropped from the theatrical edition for being unable to fit into everything else well it was shot in black and white but heres hoping that it would make it to the dvd at leastbr br structurally this series is less compartmentalized compared to its predecessor which if memory serves me right had individual stories set within its own confines and never really breaking out of its artificial borders created here a little more leeway is given where characters from various stories interact in short filler segments used to bridge scenes together and not just solely reliant on pick up shots made up of buildings and landscapes in hopes of making things look a little bit more serendipitous with the idea of chance encounters amongst strangers though one story craftily adopted this mindset for its own narrative to deliver a surprise though already seen in parisbr br one of the top draws for sitting through a film like this one is definitely the creative forces behind the stories from writers directors and cinematographers from various geographies and backgrounds mirroring the makeup of the cosmopolitan city coming together for a concept film and what more the starstudded cast too with big names amongst the lesser known ones all upping the ante through picture perfect performances be it for the entire length of the short or as a support to build upon you cant deny the initial stargazing in recognizing the notables from irrfan khan to natalie portman who also had writing and directing duties rachel bilson looking quite like bardot to spielbergs blue eye boy shia labeouf who surprisingly can act and shows off more in his few minutes here than his entire filmography to datebr br story wise like any anthology youll find some which will automatically appeal to you and with others that dont some are straightforward in nature while others have to come up with gimmicky twists that thankfully worked but these 10 stories plus because randall balsmeyer was given duties to integrate everything together for a more organic feel instead of just plain pick up shots of lesser known areas and established landmarks somehow lacked the more anything goes spirit from its predecessor with stories more rooted in reality compared to some fantastical elements in the previous film elijah woods dalliance with a vampire anyone or even less adventurous with its narrative style christopher doyles and tom tykwers starring natalie portman here it seemed that the filmmakers opted very much for safe with none venturing into that spirit of adventure and experimentbr br minor quibbles aside i still enjoyed almost all the shorts here contrary to what many others have felt about it the short film format is still very much alive and having them strung together into a feature under the city of love banner works fine and left me wondering which other cities are or have been included in its lineup i am hoping that perhaps the franchise will catch on and spread its influence here we surely have enough prolific filmmakers to be stringing together a singapore i love you so heres crossing my fingers that maybe something will materialize down the road otherwise theres always the sawasdee bangkok route of just making it without any attachments to franchise house rules
0,whoever gave this movie rave reviews needs to see more moviesbr br a loser takes his camera and photographs his mental family the movie is filled with idiots and includes live teabagging that should sum it all up for youbr br do not waste your time you may want to watch the entire movie in the hopes that it gets better as it goes on  it doesnt
7,being from a small town in illinois myself i can instantly relate to this movie considering the era it was made in the townsfolk look uncomfortably like a lot of people i grew up with yes the plot is soso and yes the acting is not going to get nominated for an oscar anytime soon but that isnt the point the point is to suspend reality and just have fun and this movie has fun aplenty from the greedyuncaring banker to the well meaningbut dimwitted deputy this movie was made to poke fun at the scifi genre and small town living at its best who cant smile at the sight of the enforcer drone or the vern droid and i loved the farmzoid wish i had one when i was growing up overall considering the technology they had available at the time this is a pleasant romp into ones childhood when you could sit back on a saturday afternoon popcorn in hand and laugh at the foibles of small town living this is a movie i would watch again and again if for no other reason than to poke fun at myself and my small town ways
0,just given the fact that it is based on the most infamous mass suicide incident of modern times would have been enough to give this 2part 1980 madefortv film attention but the fact is that it is a superb recreation of the life of the rev jim jones who built a church into a virtual empire and then encouraged it to disintegrate into a sleazy cult in which a congressman and his entourage were assassinated and 917 cult followers committed suicide by drinking koolaid doused with cyanidebr br done very tastefully but horrifying enough unlike the excruciatingly sadistic cult of the damned guyana tragedy features an allstar cast including ned beatty as rep leo ryan meg foster randy quaid brad dourif brenda vaccaro levar burton and madge sinclair but it is powers boothe in his first big role that really stands out as jim jones he actually becomes the man and his performance is riveting and chilling thus it is no wonder that this film still manages to attract attention after more than twenty years
5,i watched this movie 10 years ago and have watched it on video an average of once a year since its the type of movie thats timeless because the themes are universal yet the stories and conversation are so personal its also one of the very few movies that capture you from frame one til the credits roll despite the fact that there are really just two very involving characters this owes a lot to the engaging acting by hawke and delpy who make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine this is also the first movie i saw that mentioned reality tv and now the phenomenon is rampant i love the way this movie just envelops the audience in its space and makes you think however jaded you may be that you are one of those characters it also made me want to ride the train around europe i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie maybe that speaks about myself my friends or just the sheer genius of this movie
0,gdon and jules naudet wanted to film a documentary about rookie new york city firefighters what they got was the only film footage inside the world trade center on september 11br br having worked with james hanlons ladder company before jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak while gdon stayed at the firehouse in case anything interesting happened an airplane flying low over the city distracted jules and he pointed the camera up seconds before the plane crashed into tower onebr br jules asked the captain to follow him into the towers the first thing he saw was two people on fire something he refused to film he stayed on site for the next several hours filming reactions of the firefighters and others who were therebr br the brothers naudet took great care in not making the movie too violent grizzly and gory but the language from the firefighters is a little coarse and cbs showed a lot of balls airing it uncensored the brothers naudet mixed footage they filmed with oneonone interviews so the firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during particular moments of the crisis br br unlike a feature film of similar title most of the money from dvd sales go to 911related charities very well made emotional moving and completely devoid of political propaganda is the best documentary of the sort to date
5,please note that i havent seen the film since i discovered it in 2007 and my town is smaller and doesnt carry it however i really want to say something about it im actually doing research for university on the title character richard maurice bucke and would like to point out that the person they based the main character on was in reality completely different hollywoods ideas of people and artistic license granted the real dr bucke totally endorsed hysterectomies to cure insanity in women and would never have practiced anything as liberal as represented in the film i think its laughable to see various film critics who write for legitimate newspapers who say this film has some historical basis the only actual fact i can see is the friendship between dr bucke and walt whitman please dont waste your time on a film with such a disregard to the horror that real women experienced at the hands of this doctor who has now been glorified by the film industry
4,rented this one accidentally it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting didnt find out until i got home watched it anyways absolutely fantastic a wonderful movie and one of my top three favorite of all time i recommend it to everyonebr br the story is enjoyable and easy to follow this could have been easily messed up but the actors and director do a great job of keeping it togetherbr br the actors themselves are fantastic displaying wonderful character and doing a terrific job br br gotta find a copy somewhere
7,oh dear lord theyve turned what was a fairly thought provoking movie into a swaggering testosterone festbr br the original 1971 version of this movie was beautifully vague about our hero kowalski he was a man trying to drive from denver to san fransisco to win a bet why was he willing to risk his life for the price of a handful of uppers were not really surebr br we had a few flashbacks that gave us the picture that he was an adrenaline junkie and presumably he had led his entire life trying to make it to the vanishing point that point you see off in the distance where the left and right shoulders of the road come together and the road itself vanishes he lives only to be free and means no ill on anyone we saw several times when there were accidents he stopped to make sure the other driver was okay before moving on even the cops that were chasing himbr br when he saw the futility of his quest he took his life rather than be arrested and live a life of captivity he died like he lived running wide openbr br in the remake kowalski has a whole history including a first name even hes trying to get to the hospital where his wife is suffering from complications to her pregnancy he is a devoted husband and excited expectant father he comes to the decision to take his life after hearing his wife died in delivery but they even leave that in question when they suggest that he may have jumped out of the car before it ran into the bulldozers they even gave the part of super soul the blind dj brilliantly portrayed by clevon little in the original to jason priestly give me a break
4,this reminded me soo much of michael winners crappy dirty weekend with its awful english low budget feelbr br firstly i must say i am a fan of both exploitation and serious film i appreciate say demented for its ineptitude and last house on the left for its sheer unashamed brutality and any number of inventive and increasingly brutal italian spin offsbr br this was just pointless though kind of like a british budget director thought lets remake i spit on your grave without making it too harrowing now that horror is back in fashion with hostelbr br the whole thing just doesnt hang together or have a point whats with the rapistss daughter why bother having the man be an expert in security cameras crappy
2,this movie was astonishing it is beyond atrocious i often get together with a group of friends and go to the movie store to find awful movies to watch for their comedic value my friend suggested this one but as we watched it people began to leave i really wanted to finish it just so that i could say that i had but i was unable to its that bad horrible running gags lame acting the main characters are an annoying dinosaur klutz and whoopi goldberg i would rather watch costeners the postman twelve times in a row than see a fraction of this movie again i think they try to deal with some dinosaur discrimination issues but the part of the movie that really stands out is the dinosaur constantly knocking things over with his tail and then guffawing about it it hurts watch it if youre an aspiring masochist otherwise leave this one alone
5,for the knowledgeable beatles fan the main value in this movie is to just sit back and pick out the flaws inaccuracies combined events omitted events wildly exaggerated events omitted people timeline errors misattribute quotes incorrect clothing out of place songs and shame shame incorrect instruments and other boners i just cant think of right now the flaws come fast and furious so youll have to be on your toesbr br i didnt give this a primarily due the fact that it is filmed in liverpool and the actors the band rain give it their all the lennon character is credible and does a good job also the song cry for a shadow is heard at one point and that counts for somethingbr br so watch it for fun but please dont take it as historically accurate
0,good funny straightforward story excellent nicole kidman i almost always like the movies shes in this was a good vehicle for someone adept at comedy and drama since there are elements of both a romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories great closing lines chaplin very good here was also good in another good but unpopular romantic comedy truth about cats  dogs maybe theyre too implausible ebert didnt even post a review for this the great screwball comedies obviously were totally implausible bringing up baby etc if youve seen one implausible comedy youve seen them all or maybe people are ready to move on from the 1930s weird birthday girl is a movie ive enjoyed several times nicole kidman may be the killer app for home video
2,the story is extremely uniqueits about these pilots saving earth from alien beings but they have to use a special speed that makes everything around them age rapidlythe whole series is about the pilots dealing with the loss of timefriendsand mentorsbr br the ending could have been fantasticit started to end on a total down note and leave a real mark but instead ended on a super happy disney note and annoyed me very badbr br the animation is decent for 89 but cant compare to nowadaysi have also heard many complain about the cheesiness of the nudityi actually found it to be somewhat decentthe nudity for the most part was warranted except in episode where there was an excessbr br overall it deserves a look but the ending keeps it from being a classic
7,i love this film it is well written and acted and has good cinematography the story blends action humor mysticism and tenderness with great sets and beautiful location shots see it buy it show it to your friendsbr br the acting is good and murphy especially does a fine job portraying the reluctantunlikely hero i enjoyed all the characters and found them to be interesting and well developed with dynamic interactionsbr br i cared what happened to these people and while the outcome was pretty predictable the good guys win the hero gets the astonishingly attractive girl and the holy child saves liveswho doesnt see that coming it still made me happy when everything worked out well in the end thank god this films dignity was never ruined with a crappy sequel grab some popcorn cuddle up on the couch and watch this fun happy and entertaining film
0,valentine is another horror movie to add to the stalk and slash movie list think halloween friday the 13th scream and i know what you did last summer it certainly isnt as good as those movies that i have listed about but its better than most of the ripoffs that came out after the first friday the 13th film one of those films was the 1981 canadian made my bloody valentine which i hated alot valentine is a better film than that one but its not saying much the plot a nerdy young boy is teased and pranked by a couple of his classmates at the beginning of the film then the film moves years later when those classmates are all grown up then theyre picked off onebyone the killer is presumed to be the young boy now all grown up looking for revenge but is it him or could it be somebody else valentine has an attractive cast which includes denise richards david boreanaz marley shelton jessica capshaw and katherine heigl they do what they can with the material theyve got but a lackluster script doesnt really do them any justice there are some scary moments throughout however br br  out of four
1,it is so sad even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like blood lake theres nothing out there   the music they play in this is the funniest stuff ive ever heard i like the brother and sister in this movie they both dont try very hard to sound sarcastic when theyre saying stuff like my friends are going to be so jealous hey whats with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning thats retarded i practically ignored the second half of this my favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe the same exact sound for every chop
0,i love the book jane eyre and have seen many versions of it all have their strong points and their faults however this was one of the worst i have seen i didnt care about jane or mr rochester charlotte gainsbourg jane was almost tolerable and certainly looked the plain part but she had no emotion in any of her lines i couldnt imagine what mr rochester saw in her br br that brings us to mr rochester william hurt had even less emotion than jane if that were possible how two such insipid people could fall in love is a mystery but it certainly didnt hold my attention perhaps the director zeffrelli fell asleep during the productionbr br the timothy dalton too handsome for mr rochester version is far more faithful to the book but ciaran hinds plays the perfect mr rochester in the 1997 ae version which is not all that true to the bookbr br trying to find something positive about this movie geraldine chaplain was perfect in her role
6,teresa pavlinek was a popular member of the toronto second city cast she has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in canada finally someone has the sense to create a show for her the supporting case seems quite good too i have now watched the pilot several times and i still find it refreshing though i am not sure why the show is listed as the jane show 2004 i might be wrong but as far as i am aware the show was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on global tv in canada in early 2006 it is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well too bad this couldnt be paired up with corner gas now i know corner gas is on ctv but the two shows would be great companion pieces
1,this movie is wonderful it always has been always will be im mean really what is better then a house maid falling in love walt really out did him self here and the music a dream is a wish your heart makes is beautiful what else can you say besides terrific i cant wait until the special edition comes out it will be so awesome i cant wait to hear all of the deleted songs this movie is done so beautiful and smart it is lovely what about the cute mice too i know i keep saying the same things over and over and over again but hey this is a great movie woods was terrific in this beautiful beautiful beautiful movie
6,i saw this movie as a very young girl im 27 now and it scared me witless for years i had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way it was drawn to the music to obviously the violence my parents still argue about who allowed me to watch it and both of them say that they would never let me watch such a movie i think they only say that knowing that i have such strong feelings about it i am currently reading the book out of morbid curiosity and the fact that its a classic and it is really a great story however i dont think that it should have been made into a cartoon ever well maybe kids nowadays would find it quaint but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and i still have a hard time seeing rabbits drawn in a similar way gives me a little heart palpitation every time yah i am a wuss but i strongly suggest that any parent looking to show this movie to their kids read them the book instead or watch it first to make certain that they approve of the content not everyone finds it as disturbing as i did but we are out there
5,anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a good film does not appreciate quality movies this movie was an insult to watch the direction was high school film class quality as well as the cinematography the blair witch project had better cinematography and i hate that move with a passion the storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie but it fell flat from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the movie someone mentioned that this film was about a childs imagination okay thats all good and fine but they still could have done better things with this script than what they did i mean come on the indian in the store did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the indian and the entire story about an indian spirit called wendigo which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here so you think okay creepy ghost scenario but then she just barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy that was so lame it goes beyond pathetic the ending left you wondering not only what happened to otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of omg why the hell did i just waste my time watching this this is a move that i recommend not to watch there are definitely better quality films out there that wont insult your intelligence thank god i never had to pay to see this movie i would have demanded my money back for those that were easily entertained by this movie its very sad that you lowered your standards to this level of film making to actually say that it was a good movie
2,elviracassandra peterson is the host of a cheap horror show after she finds out that her dead aunt has left her some stuff elvira goes to england to pick it up hoping it will be some money but to her horror elvira finds out that all her aunt has left her is her house her dog and a cookbook elvira decides to settle in the house anyways but with her striking dark looks and her stunning features she will not be able to live in peace all the neighbours are now turning the whole town against her and with elviras outrageous attitude and looks everyone better watch out because elvira is on fire i really enjoyed this movie its really fun to watch get elvira into all these adventures shes just great the whole movie puts you into a halloween mood sure its silly and the jokes are cheap but its a pleasure to watch it i would give elvira mistress of the dark 810
1,if youre not in the mood for more than an hour long movie than this film could give you some variation what i love is the ongoing surprises its not only once that you want one or more of the short film in new york i love you to be continue yeah some of the short films makes you curious some of them very short some of them longer some of them has it definite ends some of them dontbr br most of the story presents the sad side of the capital city it shows many different nationality background many of it make it feels the same way where i have been once went to a capital city in other countries for a year where it has many people came from different countries this movie explore many type of things you might have known but for all the characters its a new things maybe some of you have traveled abroad alone to stay for a year or two just to feel something new meet new people feel dreamy sad but the kind of sad you looking for because it is just that bored you were in your own home you might want to reliving it again by watching this
6,i remember devil dog playing on tbs almost 20 years ago and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day its not that bad for a madefortv horror movie but it is derivative mostly of the exorcist and businesslike for lack of a better word it wont blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting but its not a waste of time either its the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you arent in the mood to think too hardbr br however if you go into the movie looking for some laughs you wont be disappointed the early scenes with lucky the devil dog as a cute little puppy with children of the damned eyes are hilariously nonthreatening and the climactic bluescreen effects of a giant black dog with horns are pretty sidesplitting and keep an eye out for the cloaked satanist in maverick shades toward the beginningbr br not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination but i wish they still made stuff like this for tv
7,an underrated addition to the graham greene cinematic canon  its perceived faults can now be seen as virtues director shumlin theatrical director frames his action with an oppressive rigidity appropriate to the material and the seemingly inept compositions compellingly suggest unease both a dark thriller and a story of moral regeneration for the female character in a 40s thriller the film has an upright hero who turns mad and murderous and possibly paedophiliac brilliantly brings the faraway ideologies of the spanish civil war into jolting dangerous reality has one horrific murder an astonishing insights into class and capitalism clever theatrical metaphors a rare approximation of greenes god and an ending that is only happy if you know nothing about history
1,this masterpiece of lesbian horror comes from exploitation master joseph wsarnoit features plenty of soft core sexreally hot lesbian sequences plus a lot of naked womenthe acting is pretty good and the film is quite atmospheric and wellmademarie forsa is one of the hottest chicks i have ever seen in a horror movieits a visual pleasure to see her wonderful bodysarno really knows how to pick up hot looking ladiesa must see for fans of sexploitation
2,i thought watching employment videos on corporate compliance was tedious this movie went nowhere fast what could have been a somewhat cheesy half hour twilight zone episode turned into a seemingly endless waste of film on people parking their cars a picture of some dudes swimming pool he really needs to answer his phone by the way a dot matrix printer doing its job and heuy and louey sitting in a yellow lighted control room repeating t minus 10 and counting as if something exciting is going to happen it doesnt so dont get your hopes up the best thing about this movie is to see james best and gerald mcc in something other than there famous tv personalities and that is stretching to find anything good and do not get me started on the music which was totally composed of a tympani some large marine mammals and microphone feedback this movie is as close as i have given a one yet but it gets the because i actually was able to finish this insomnia cure and didnt have to leave in the middle avoid at all costs
0,i was hoping for some sort of indepth background information on the apollo 11 mission and what i got was some decent interview material with buzz aldrin gene krantz and other people involved in the mission linked by overhyped disasterpredicting sensationalising voiceover in the worst tradition of tv productionbr br if you could cut out the voiceover and change the spin of the program to a positive testament of how people can overcome setbacks to achieve a goal out of the ordinary then this couldve been great  but i feel ive wasted about 45 minutes of my life whilst watching a 60 minute programme i want those minutes back
0,wowwwwww about an hour ago i finally finished watching this terrible movie i wanted to turn it off within the first like 10 minutes but i figured id give it a chance because it just hadddd to get better or at least have some redeeming qualities like i figured at the very least it would be a make you think type movie or like really intelligent or very well filmed or somethingneedless to say that was not the case and i wasted about an hour and a half of my life im not even going to get into why its terrible because its a waste of my time to explain that this may contain spoilersimdb you should calm down on the spoilers thing and pay more attention to making sure that the people who rate the movies and comment are not paid to write good reviews or involved somehow in the movie or anything else like that i thought it would be humorous after this terrible film to come see hoe bad the rating would be and i was very very shocked to see the fairly high ratingsall the ratings with about 710 stars clearly must be about some completely different movie im still a big imdb fan but seriously rethink this rating process because this movie should be rated no higher than maaaybbbeee like a
0,my watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the sequel togetherwhich makes me compliment the makers of this flick for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romanticism and very marginally separating it from the idea of relationships as a lot has been written about the movie already it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally lovedbr br i think the point where jesse and celine make phony phone calls to their respective friends was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending 24 hrs the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly dealt withbr br on the plot front  making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplishbr br i believe in romantic flicks of such flavor  the characters are not clearly designed even in the writers and directors mind what the actors bring out is what becomes of them  right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify to become the character the life the actor gives has to go beyond instructions and the storyhere both the actors do just the right job kudosand before sunset is another feather which makes this one even more beautiful
1,i found this a bit hard to follow to the extent that it seemed to dip in the middle while i tried to make head or tail of who was fighting who and why one of the problems is the culturallanguage one here we have a chinesetaiwanesejapanese problem of which we know little and because we are simply reading english subtitles inevitably loose some of the subtleties another problem is that there seem to be just too many only half explained twists and coincidences nevertheless it seems unlikely that there is a wholly bad miiki film and this certainly is not that plenty of stylish and bone crunching violence a window upon some less than orthodox sexual goings on plus the family aspect all in all a decent ride but maybe checking out the storyline might actually be helpful before watching this one

7,the hg wells classic has had several incarnations the 05 speilburg version and the classic 53 version but only this one stays completely true to the book nothing is changed nothing is removedbr br originally released as a 3hour film the director recut the film down to 2hours of pure excellence its got a chapter by chapter visualization of the novels pages that wells would be proud of the story is as everyone remembers martians invade the earth with capsules containing an army of tripod walking war machines the people of 19th century earth are illprepared to repel the alien forces and fight back with canons and guns who mes shells bound right off the walkers and when humanity is no longer a world wide power they are saved by the smallest of organisms on earthbr br the film is an excellent accomplishment for director timothy hines who has great potential as he brought this vision to life with a meager million budget today bmovies have larger budgets
0,red eye is not the kind of movie thats going to win the palme dor but wes craven has never been that kind of director anyway and his branding is a good indication of what a filmgoer can expectbr br the fact that red eye is a tight little undemanding package at 94 minutes is part of its charm and an indication of cravens craft in producing lightweight but generally enjoyable box office fare in fact its the perfect kind of movie to show as inflight entertainment attentionholding without putting any intellectual or emotional challenges on the viewerbr br overall there is a cheesy feeling to the plot vague terrorist subplot motivation and the supporting characters and the main section has a tv movie feel however there are definite elements of hitchcockian suspense and echoes of schumachers phone booth which ultimately is a more sophisticated and pretentious play on the same idea of emotional crisis being played out suppressed in publicbr br for a film that focuses mainly on two people sitting in airline seats it lives or dies on the characters and script cillians icy but eloquent jackson rippner and rachel macadams resourceful lisa are the main reasons the film gets carried off not only making the dialogue zing but also giving some sort of adams rib type dimension to their battle of male logic against feminine sensitivitybr br in the final portion of the film craven indulges himself a little scream style as manchasesgirlwithknife the most surprising revelation here is what brian cox looks like after the just for men treatment his ubiqutous appearance in films as diverse as super troopers the ring and this making him the sexegenarian version of jude lawbr br short haul fun
5,this movie is probably for you it had an overall meditative quality from the music to the beautiful photography and listening to the often clich things about life that andy goldsworthy would say as he worked or in between shots if youre familiar with buddhism that is the sort of the sense i got out of this film the impermanence of life the beauty of nature the interconnectedness of all things etc however what i did not understand confused and ultimately forced me to leave without finishing i saw over an hour of it was the redundancy of the whole thing you only find out bits and pieces of why hes commissioned and how he can even afford to live off of this kind of work the art work comes alive but all his talking with no conclusions leads to dead ends
6,yesim going with the 10 on this and heres why in the last few years i have watched quite a few comedies and only left with a few mild laughs and a couple video rental late fees because the movies were that easy to forget then i stumble upon nothing looked interesting wasnt expecting much though i was wrong this was probably one of the funniest movies i have ever had the chance to watch dave and andrew make a great comedic pair and the humor was catchy enough to remember but not over complex to the point of missing the joke i dont want to remark on any of the actual scenes because i do feel this is a movie worth seeing for once with more and more pointless concepts coming into movies you know like killer military jets and fresh remakes that are ruining old classics this movie will make you happy to say its ok to laugh at nothing
3,this is a straighttovideo movie so it should go without saying that its not going to rival the first lion king but that said this was downright goodbr br my kids loved this but thats a given they love anything thats a cartoon the big shock was that i liked it too it was laugh out loud funny at some parts even the fart jokes had lots of rather creative tieins with the first movie and even some jokes that you had to be older to understand but without being risqu like in shrek do you think hes compensating for somethingbr br a special note on the fart jokes i was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just toilet noises in fact there were almost no noisesimagery at all the references were actually rather subtle they actually had a setuppunchlineetc and were almost in good taste id like my kids to think that theres more to humor than going to the bathroom and this movie is fine in those regardsbr br hmm what else the music was soso not nearly as creative as in the first or second movie but plenty of fun for the kids no painfully corny moments which was a blessing for me a little action but nothing too scary the secret of nimh gave my kids nightmares not sure a g rating was appropriate for that onebr br all in all id say this is a great movie for kids of any age one thats 100 safe to let them watch i try not to be overly sensitive but ive had to jump up and turn off the tv during a few movies that were less kidappropriate than expected  but youre safe to leave the room during this one id say stick around anyway though you might find that you enjoy it too 
1,why did i go to see this film honestly because jim carrey was in it and in the past he has made hilarious movies that have made me cry with laughter so do you really blame me for expecting that again additionally the premise the funny trailer his costar jennifer anistons involvement and the fact it was a massive hit stateside encouraged mebr br however as my one line summary suggests i was disappointed for various reasonsbr br reason it wasnt funny in a 2hour movie i laughed for about 510minutesall together the rest of the time i sat thinking i really should have got some icecream i admit that maybe it is wrong to judge jim carrey on his previous films but what does he really expect when he makes gems such as the truman show  liar liar  me myself and irene  dumb and dumber  the mask and the ace ventura films then produces in bruce nolans own words such a mediocre filmbr br reason jennifer anistons role was criminally underwritten i mean hello shes been around in the public eye for about ten years now and in this film she gets about four lines to say wrongbr br reason one word  clichbr br reason a casual deployment of specifically american references  jimmy hoffa walter cronkite sweeps week  is a clue to the films specifically homegrown appeal a teenager says no to drugs and yes to an education  thats a miracle want to see a miracle soon be the miracle god tells bruce a heavy handed sentiment that seems to have gone down a treat in the us but might face tougher resistance in markets that retain an inkling for subtlety additionally i still go to school and that statement suggests me and all of my friends are miraclesor maybe it just means we have brainsbr br in this film there are enough funny carrey moments to make you chuckle and prevent bruce almighty from being a total calamity but you are advised to start revising your expectations downwards
7,is it a coincidence that orca was made two years after jaws orca isnt exactly a jaws rip off but it is obvious that it tried to profit from jawss success first of all orca in my opinion was a bad movie not terrible but definitely not good average at bestbr br the plot is basically a male killer whale orca after seeing its mate and its unborn calf killed by a fisherman seeks revenge i couldnt stand to watch this movie again the direction of this film is poor and when compared to jaws it looks like the director producers and writers were almost talentlessbr br as for the acting it was very average and believable however the actual characters arent the least bit likable the effects were alright for its time and the footage of the killer whale looked pretty goodbr br the violence is confusing bloody and not recommended for more sensitive people the music is overdone and very loud drowning out the sound effects and irritating at times i hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale killer whales dont mate with only one mate as depicted in orcabr br overall this movie was badpoor in my opinion because of the reasons listed above some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of vengeance amongst animals and humans so im not going to bash this movie and i can understand why some people may like itbr br my rating 3510 but for its concept possibly a 510
0,yes marie dresler drinks prune juice that she thinks is poison and she exits runningbr br dresler is good never my cup of tea but she is a solid performer who surely holds the screenbr br i watched this for polly moran whom ive seen elsewhere here moran is ok  just ok  as dresslers shrewish friendfoe too bad she has sunk into nearly total oblivionbr br the plot is good hearted bad guys try to rob the townspeople dressler triumphs and all ends wellbr br i do wonder about the central plot mechanism bonds this came out during the depression so maybe everyone was familiar with bonds and what they can do if used well and if used wrongly i however not of that era am vaguely familiar with them theyre like stocks only different right it seems odd to build a story about the little man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary entity
2,normally when i go on a raid of the local hollywood video i head towards the bhorror movies to me the basic principals behind a bhorror movie is its camp value heavy gore lots of needless nudity and special effects that anyone can put together with a pack of corn syrup and latex i rented cradle of fear strictly because ive been a fan of the band since they released theyre first demo in 1995 the movie started off on an interesting note and then when i saw dani filth stomp on an extremely obvious latex mask i laughed when i saw the lesbian sex scene for the sake of a lesbian sex scene i laughed even harder i spent pretty much the entire movie laughing and when i wasnt laughing i was shaking my head thinking about how a multimillion dollar rock star would want to make a movie that seemed like it was on a budget of multihundreds of dollars the whole point of this movie to me seemed to attract the hardcore goth kids who think death destruction sex blood and satan are the greatest things invented since lava lamps that was really it to me this movie seemed like 805 of the things that happened in this movie just happened for the sake of being satanic this movie had a lot of potential and really could have been a real good movie but in the end this movie really is just an extended cradle of filth video
0,it does come out of left field and really isnt what youre expecting but i love that the most memorable movie experiences come from being surprised if you ask me if you havent been tipped off about the mysterious thing that makes these brothers so oddyoure in for a treatbr br the cast is fantastic but not stretching so much that its palpable the special effects come out of nowhere seriously its like an oddly dark romantic comedy until they do  then wow and theyre great the overall cinematography is easy on the eyes the editing and sound are very good quality and the twisted story unfolds without clichs while none of these aspects individually make it a blockbuster the what the hell factor alone makes it a film treasurebr br the people who bash this movie make no sense its one of those oftenoverlooked flicks of the 90s that youve either never heard of or love so much you jump at the mention of its titlebr br im in the latter group
2,that is the only question i am left with why did this movie suck so much when it had such a great cast why was the writing so bad it left the audience completely unconnected with the characters why did it not make any sense at all why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and hollywood the hell out of it when all it needed was good smart story telling why i never understand why movies that start out good turn into a pile of crap by the time theyre released i hope for the sake of freeman an spacey who are oscar winners that this never is released to the big screens in americabr br as someone that holds a bachelors degree in journalism the whole story is just utterly laughable i justthink the script had potential but the execution turned it into a clich and an awful one at that just no
0,i am a big fan of ludlums work and of the covertone books and i had often thought how incredible they would be made into a film imagine my excitement then on learning that such a movie actually existed the hades factor being the first in the series seemed an obvious place to startbr br from the outset the film was disappointing simple elements from the film such as griffins first meeting with smith are needlessly different from the book and much less exhilarating several characters are poorly cast too for starters dorff is woeful as smith not a bad actor just an incredibly bad choice as he is far too soft and fails to exhibit many of the features that are definitive of john smithbr br renaming reassignment and even omission of certain characters further degrades this film for example the removal of victor tremont and the entire backstory of the virus including the involvement of vaxham makes the entire point to the film somewhat hazy marty zellerbach is a very large part of the book and in the seat he takes vary much a back seat not to mention that the film character shares nothing in common with the character in the book is another big mistakebr br rachel russel is presumably supposed to be randi russel from the book not only is she supposed to be the sister of sophie amsden should be called sophia russel but she is also supposed to work from the cia not covertone which brings me to my final point and i think one of the most important covertone doesnt even exist at this point not until the second book of the series is covertone devised by the president as a preventative measure against further biological terrorismbr br to be honest i could go on all day in short  if you like the books and want to see a good adaptation im afraid youll be bitterly disappointed even as an action movie it is thoroughly average mainly due to very lackluster editing and poor effects the bumbled story line and dullasditchwater script are the final nails in the very cheap coffin of this film
7,after eight moto films the series had run its course as this last entry demonstrates peter lorre was clearly weary of trying to pump some sort of human interest and entertainment value into the wispy character of moto and the dreadful idea of pairing him with a funny british sidekick utterly defeats all his efforts here
1,aro tolbukhin burnt alive seven people in a mission in guatemala in the 70s also he declared that he had murdered another 16 people he used to kill pregnant women and then he set them on firebr br this movie is a documentary that portraits the personality of aro through several interviews with people that got to know him and through some scenes played by actors based on real factsbr br aro tolbukhin is a serious work so analytical its not morbid at all such a horrifying testimony about how some childhood trauma can turn a man into a monsterbr br my rate 710
4,hi im from taft california and i like this movie because it shows how us little town people love our sports football is the main thing in taft and this movie shows just how important it is i personally think they should make another one but instead of actors use us kids to play the games well show you our determination weve beat bakersfield every game for the past years and since im a senior next year its my last chance and then its college weve had running backs lead the state and im next if you want to know me im kyle taylor and i average seven to eight yards a carry and about five times a game ill break away on a 75 or around that yard run so check us out at our website and go to our sports page bye
5,i saw it i agree with him 100 but i didnt care for his delivery he just came off as an asshole in a poorly edited contrived juvenile smear campaign edit cuts galore etc the camera would be focused on him and youd see or edit cuts just over the course of a minute or two of dialog add in the constant boom mikes in the camera shot which is a film nonobr br this documentary hits a topic with so many angles so many interesting stories that the movie is just so easily done picking on religious fanatics is like picking on the retarded kid it is so easy it is just wrong i mean how hard is it to make these people look like nut bags to make them contradict themselves you just let them recite more then a verse or two i do like when he jumped back in forth between people of the same religion and showed them completely contradicting themselvesbr br i just think he could have done something a little more creative the part with the neurologist talking about brain activity was never fleshed out it could have been interesting to show brain scans of people during religious fits compared to drugs or sex or  he could have played more on the women all rejoicing over the passion play that looked more like a snuff scene in a new rob zombie movie more could have gone into the history of john smith the mormon founder who had quite the colorful past delve into science vs religion one is a very methodical very strict process for increasing the confidence in theories it builds on itself from a solid bottom up a new layer on top of a more proved layer an enormous burden of proof is required each step of the way the other starts at the top and comes down with unchallengeable claims it is so because well i said sobr br done right id say turn it into an hbo original series hit a different religion every weekbr br it was an eye opener about one thing i must have been blind good ole gwbush no wonder he got elected he had the religious majority and well now that is the blind leading the blindbr br bill moyer well what can i expect from a guy who hands out at sutra in newport beach
6,this is one of those movies that should have been way better than it turned out to be i dread to think what the blockbusterapproved edit must have looked like because the directors cut on dvd was a bore of the epic proportions naturally you dont expect it to be the godfather but an acting class or two might have come in handybr br also there were so many cute guys in this movie but they were woefully underexploited i like watching a bevy of hotties writhe around in their bvds as much as the next guy but even i have a right to expect a little more it wasnt a total loss though at least we got a peek a drew fullers covered junk and truly upsetting haircut and theres huntley ritter looking even cuter than he did in bring it on and acting about as well theres always a silver lining kids you just have to look really hard for it and occasionally you have to make use of your pause button
6,i was really horrified by this eerie movie what an unusual dark atmosphere and such a creepy musical score really promising indeed after ten minutes you really start sweating and feeling uncomfortable for you start fearing the worst this movie has the atmosphere of a true nightmare and whats worseit all comes out for one hour and a half i have been trying to fight complete boredom and falling asleep but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake nuit noire is a truly horrifying picture  for your eyes your ears your intelligence and most of all your wallet since the thought of spending precious money on a movie ticket for this cheap amateuristic homevideo is the biggest horror of all
6,well i suppose the good news concerning william wincklers 2001 opus the doubled avenger is that it manages to unite three of russ meyers mammarian marvelskitten natividad haji and raven de la croixin one picture i can only assume that lorna maitland tura satana and babette bardot were busy the week they shot this thingor else managed to see a copy of the script in advance the bad news though and theres plenty of it is that this filmif it can even be called that having been shot straight to videois a complete misfire a total abortion an outandout atrocity an absolute abomination and truly one of the worst pictures that i have ever seen look no further for the lamest superhero movie ever made the plot here such as it is deals with kitten gaining superpowers after fellating the rare cockazilla plant in south america to cure her breast cancer oy and later battling a trio of megalunged bikini dancers back in la too bad that every lame boob joke trotted out falls completely you should pardon the expression flat that there is zero actual nudity in the film at all other than some old photos of kitten in her heyday and that some shaving cream and a papiermache boulder are the sum total of the special fx the meyer gals here are a bit long in the toothsaggy in the chest to put it kindly although sheri dawn thomas as bikini girl ooga boobies  does manage to uh stand out nicely so why have i given this juvenile unfunny failed embarrassment of a movie stars instead of to be succinct joe bob briggs his voiceover commentary in the special features of the dvd i just watched is absolutely hilarious especially when he pulls out around 100 synonyms for the word breast from the 1000 on his web sites canonical hooters list the man is a national treasure and he manages to upgrade this skeet of a disc to coaster status
4,the story at the outset is interesting slavery in the late 20th century from west africa to the arab middle east the problem with it is that it intentionally castigates two of director richard fleishers favorite enemies arabs and germans to make us believe that very arablooking men would be free to roam around and easily catch blacks in west africa is as believable as whites hunting for slaves in roots obviously both trades arewere run by locals and involved much more sophisticated networks while arab countries are complicit in todays child and sex slave trade israel is one of the worst violators according to amnesty international so why only point out arabs and then choose a german as the only european buyer its obvious bias and hatred of those people by a jewish directorbr br the acting is above average especially by peter ustinov suleiman and kabir bedi malik michael caine dr linderby is good as always
4,the movie had a lot of potential unfortunately it came apart because of a weakimplausible story line miscasting and general lack of contentsubstance one of the very obvious flaws was that sean connery who played an arab man didnt know how to pronounce his own arab name this may seem a small flaw but it points to the seeming lack of effort in paying attention to details the quality of acting was uniformly well below average br br movies solitary saving grace was the twist in the plot at the very end and a french song i dont recall the title overall it was a pretty bad movie where sean connery was visibly miscast
5,what a delightful movie the characters were not only lively but alive mirroring real every day life and strife within a family each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of close friendsbr br the story has a truetolife flow that the viewer can assimilate into and be part of the drama the laughter and tears as the plot of the movie develops the script does a good job of capturing the common emotions actions and reactions of the characters to conflict opinion and resolvebr br not an epic but it is a very nice movie to watch with loved ones plenty of knowing head nods and ahhh moments to share and enjoy
0,a womans nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alivethe cheating husband wants her dead and decides to make good use of her phobia by sticking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basementof course bhorror movie queen brinke stevens transforms into hideous ghostly creaturethe only reason to see this amateurish junk flick is michael berryman in a really small cameo and two sex scenes with delia sheppardand the last twenty minutes of brinkes bloody rampage are quite fun to watchthe special effects for example laughable decapitated head are truly awfulbetter watch scalps or alien dead againof course i aint expecting classy entertainment from fred olen raybut haunting fear is too dull to be enjoyable
0,i gave this film an 1010 with some reluctance as its hard to praise something that so haunted and terrified me for years the sheer menace on the woman in blacks face is just pure horror and the accompanying music just worsens the dread br br i saw this when it was first on tv when i was 10 and it really did disturb me for years im fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said this too so many movie reviews go on about how disturbing or terrifying a film might be but you can believe all those who have posted on this board this really is incredibly powerful stuff i mean i really like horror films and generally find them quite funny more often than not but this really is menacing and will probably disturb most people i havent seen it since i was 10 and im tempted to watch it again but fear i might have some sleepless nights i cant quite put my finger on what it is exactly but i think its something to do with the fact that fear is the womans greatest weapon and that we as viewers are just as susceptible as we feel the fear so intensely its remarkable that other viewers feelings are so unanimousbr br ive also seen the stage play which was an excellent productionbut nothing can compare to this
5,this is a very funny movie easy to watch that entertains you almost all the time the work of the director is recognizable and the type of humor is his trademark the movie is a typical police partners history like lethal weapon but the jokes and comedy are of argentinian sort the twist is that one of them is a psychologist played by peretti and has to go with detective diaz played by luque on his assignments while he also assist him diaz is troubled because his wife cheated on him some of the dialogs are hilarious worldwide understandable and laughable anywhere is very good overall it would deserved an but i rated because it gets a little down at the end on a personal remark i must add that is a bravo for argentinian filmmakers considering the little good is coming lately
6,woody harrelson and wesley snipes team up as hustlers on the basketball court okay that sounds all right there it leaves lots of room for good comedy and a good story but no such event took place in the many following boring minutes of this pathetic attempt of a film this movie became redundant retarded and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds had gone by woody harrelson played one of my favorite tv characters woody from cheers and i was looking forward to seeing him in this movie but after seeing his  acting performance  i have come to the conclusion that he should stay playing dumb country hicks who bartend his acting was as dull and poor as the movie another actor in this unreal film was rosie perez i have liked movies with perez before but i have decided that the reason i have enjoyed other works in her career was that she was not a main character and didnt have that many speaking lines  do the right thing  but now in white men cant jump she was made a central character with many lines thus meaning that the audience has to put up with her incredibly annoying and whining voice so after seeing this film  term used loosely  and hearing rosie perez for much more than appreciated i can now say that im a white man and im getting ready to jump    off a twenty story apartment building
2,im a fan of arty movies but regretfully i have to report this movie to be pretentious drivel agonisingly slow to develop a nonexistent plot based on a promising premise the experience is shall we say trying even after bad movies i feel that i learn something or enjoyed some aspect but there there was nothing to appreciate the premise was not uninteresting but the movie starts and ends there the acting was ok though the characters were utterly boring for the protagonist to aim at such an audacious goal she is mightily empty pity i usually enjoy movies that are unformulaic but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content
4,i do not know if this movies problems are more the fault of direction or script as you will see in many reviews the editing style is way overdone it is absolutely distracting and without substance which could be considered a good thing if you look at some of the quotes from the movie i do not write many reviews here but felt this movie was so awful that it deserved comment movies like this erode at movie making as an art form movies like this one show more and more clearly that the current reality focus in cinema is revealing the quality of the characters behind them people hone there craft there senses and there business sense  overlooking there own inner life however i do not put blame on them it is more and more the unfortunate condition of this age  qualified by films like this one but by proxy these manufacturers i would dare not call artists vomit there lack of inner life or regard onto the screen  diffusing it to everyone a story of bounty hunters guns guns and more guns heavy handed flaunting of sex  for the oh so popular actress did they write the lap dance scene after they signed her over saturated over exaggerated one liners nonlinear plots all different and yet all the same annoying overwhelming music to push the emotion down your throat a story a development of character or just withheld missing information revealed at the end to create the effect of a story  as if one took place it altogether lacks anything remotely resembling subtlety it is a caricature of stereotypes and genre where are the films with awareness what about subtlety of sound and music that you are not even aware is there what about the depth of a look what about editing with a point about mind and consciousness yes even in action films this can happen sure they have honed a craft but what use is it without soul or wisdom of insight into the human condition can the people who commented and said that this is an apogee of art or compare this to picasso and others  i say put this next to gandhi or the godfather even the original trilogy of star wars or the lord of the rings then look me in the face and say it again it is a good crew but they need some help with depth and story i hope they get it because i like the crews previous work better luck next time
3,this movie is awful i dont even know where to begin im speechless i cant even describe how awful this is the blood is flourescent first of all and the acting is awful the only good part was the biker chick that saves the day this movie was rediculous i dont see how it could even get a vote of its so bad it looks like it was made by highschool students
1,my sincere advice to all dont watch the moviebr br dont even go near to the theater where this movie is being played even a glimpse of it is bad for health serious no jokes its 330 am in the morning and i returned from this crappiest movie on this universe four hours damn i am proud that i survived after all of it if this is called survivalbr br i am highly frustrated annoyed disappointed it was sheer waste of time money went in drain no plot hope i wake up tomorrow sane and with no memories of this night rubbish moviebr br happy republic day to one and all 
2,this is a cute and sad little story of cultural difference kyoko is a beautiful japanese woman who has run to california to escape from a failed relationship in japan ken is a japanese american manual laborer with aspirations of rock and roll stardom but little concrete to offer a potential partner kyoko marries ken in order to be able to stay permanently in the us with the understanding that although they will live together until she gets a green card the marriage will be in name only it soon develops that the parties are not on the same wavelength  or perhaps in the same time zone hence the title of the movie as an immigration attorney i have seen such arrangements take on a life of their own so i was pleased to see how well the filmmaker developed the dramatic possibilities of this situation
0,the sea is watching was an interesting film experience first of all the overall feel was intense internalized claustrophobic and small each frame seemed to be a photograph of something inside something very focused and not part of a bigger picture it was obvious what we were to look at in each frame the physicality of the set itself contributed to that feeling of smallness and intensity the lights along the middle of the road cut the road in half and the tiny gate to the tiny settlement followed by the tiny and few cubbyholes that served as the establishments that made up what seemed to be the entire town even the view of the ocean was framed by a tiny landing on which one can count the number of longer grass swaying in the wind no panoramic views in fact it reminded me of the montmarte sequence of moulin rouge where the camera sweepingly focuses in to the windmill creating again a feeling of a small area where everything is happeningbr br while the acting was passable considering i really could not discern how the lines were truly delivered i felt that the actions were overly melodramatic and nonsensical why kikuno would continue carrying on the way she did when fusanosuke announced his impending marriage really didnt seem true  people hadnt really changed that much and the character kikuno was so strong and resilient that even if they were busy taking on oshins business for naught the reaction seemed out of character and unnecessary and distracting another example of odd acting was when the drunk boyfriend of kikuno showed up and ryosuke decided to intervene and was pushed down the stairs the way in which he got up and menacingly came up the stairs and the ensuing fight outside among the reeds was simply unsatisfying it wasnt that i like fight scenes  au contraire  but it seemed a little stilted and again overly dramaticbr br otherwise while not a beautiful movie to watch it provided an interesting glimpse into the darker side of prostitution as opposed to the geisha unfortunately perhaps it fed into our expectations of wanton women the honey  ill give you a deal comments supported by the overstretched actions and seriously caused me to doubt whether indeed 19th century prostitutes really acted in that way but once inside the house the inner workings became most interesting vivid and real and provided a scenario i never anticipated or imagined in my romantic view of japan in the 19th century
5,this movie had so much potential  a strong cast a reasonably strong idea and clearly a decent budget im not sure where it all went wrong but each of those elements was wasted the story went nowhere the characters were hollow to say the least and the result was a very boring pointless waste of a film i hated it judging by the other votes im in the minority here and must be some sort of freak however i thought this movie was dreadful i had high hopes but was very disappointed a particular disappointment was jody fosters character a very cocky fixer of sorts makes a nice idea jody was confident and sexy but the character did nothing and went nowhere denzel washington played the same character he always plays  enjoyable but nothing new
1,why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like the godfather titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st centurywith great actingdirectingeffectsmusic and generally everything this movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didnt like it any more so most of the world decided to agree there is nothing wrong with this movie all i can say is that this movie not only being the most heavily oscar awarded movie of all time the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies ive ever seen apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time the only movies that come close to being like all the star wars and the lord of the rings trilogy or anything by the masters hitchcock or spielberg or tim burton these are all good movies and directors but none match up to james camerons masterpiece titanic
6,this is one of the few comedies i can watch again and again and still laugh out loud in other places i have read complaints about racism and sexism from sanctimonious politically correct prigs there is neither here unless you define sexism as a woman as housewife and racism as a family employing a colored maidbr br the lines are hilarious and all the leads have never been better melvin douglas is especially brilliantbr br if youve ever thought of or tried to build a new house you will be relieved to know that no matter how infuriating the process no matter how much a lamb among wolves you may feel you are not alone
3,my flatmate rented out this film the other night so we watched it togetherbr br the first impression is actually a positive one because the whole movie is shot in this colorful grainy postmtv texture fast sequences cool angles sweeping camera moves  for the moment there you feel like you about to watch another snatch for the momentbr br when the plot actually starts unfolding one starts to feel as if one overdosed amphetamine things just dont make sense anymore i would hate to spoil the fun of watching it by giving out certain scenes but then again the film is so bad that you are actually better off not watching itbr br first you think it is a crime story recounted in a conversation between keira knightley and lucy liu wrong this conversation provides no coherent narrative whatsoever rather on the contrary dominos lesbian come on on lucy lius character during the second part of the movie just throws the audience into further confusionbr br then i thought that maybe it is a movie about a girl from affluent but dysfunctional background who grew to be a tough bounty hunter in any case that is the message conveyed by the opening scenes but after that the question of dominos character is entirely lost to the criminal plot so in short no this is not a movie about dominos characterbr br then i thought its probably a story of one robbery a pretty bloody robbery 10 millions went missing bounty hunters are chasing around suspected robbers mafia kids are executed hands are removed domino tries to crack why this time they get no bounty certificates etc but soon this impression is dispelled by another uturn of the plotbr br this time we are confronted with a sad story of an obese afroamerican woman who fakes drivers licenses at the local mvd and at the age of 28 happens to be a youngest grandmother lateesha stars on jerry springer show tries to publicize some new wacky racial theory and at the same time struggles to find money for her sick granddaughterbr br what does this have to do with the main plot urgh well nobody knows except that director had to explain the audiences where will bounty hunters put their collectors fee of 300000br br then at some point you start to think oh it is about our society and the way media distorts things there is reality tv crew driving around with the bounty hunters and doing some violent footage the bounty hunters are also stuck with a bunch of hollywood actors who just whine all the time about having their noses broken and themselves dragged around too many crime scenes but no this is not a movie about media they just appear sporadically throughout the moviebr br plus there are numerous other subplots the crazy afghani guy bent on liberating afghanistan the love story between domino and chocco the mescaline episode the fbi surveillance operationbr br can all of the things mentioned above be packed into hrs movie judge for yourself but my conclusion is clear  it is a veritable mess
2,how do i begin this movie is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen it has no redeemable qualities i just sat through this movie and it was a struggleit failed to get even a single smile on my facei find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film i felt that this movie was a failed attempt at distasteful humor the only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack im pretty sure thats the reason i wanted to see this movie in the first placei will wrap this up as i am going to try and forget the time i just wasted with this piece of crap i will leave you with this warning do not watch this film it sucks
6,the script was very weak wo enough character arcs to make you care one bit about the characters or what happens to them the script is way too talky and not enough gore or action to even call it slow paced the story gets to the point that you just want everyone to shut up and die as quickly as possible so you dont have to listen to them talk this very muted stiff dialogue on a technical note the music mix is way to high and makes it hard to understand what is being said most times then again this could be called a blessing overall this same story could have better been told in a short film w a running time under 30 minutes the obvious in your face homages to sam raimi and evil dead would have been good had they been more subtle but here they seem more like a bald faced rip off cmon this kind of 35mm budget and this is the best that could be done still the cinematography lighting design and shots were very well done indeed
0,i can always tell when something is going to be a hit i see it or hear it and get a good feeling i did not get a good feeling watching the preview i was not at all enthusiastic about this film and i am not at all surprised that it is rated here as one of the worst 100 films i was in fact proved rightbr br the first thing that threw me off was the title not that i have a problem with ebonicsi am black by the way but for a movie they could have used a better title and for this time use a title that doesnt have bad grammar i heard the dialog saw the acting and all i could do was make facesbr br i also think that the dance movie theme is being overdone at least you got served was better than this in my opinion even the soundtrack didnt thrill me
6,the first film i had to walk out on and it was the cast and crew prescreening not that i was involved i hasten to add i made it through the first hour so i reckon im just qualified to comment but that was my limitbr br like other comments here how did this get through any kind of qa an accumulation of the very worst in dialogue the epitome of wooden acting awful casting all wrapped together without a plotbr br tara fitzgeralds casting was bizarre almost comic she possesses the worst russian accent in movie historybr br as i left the screening the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema they obviously couldnt sit through it again eitherbr br 
6,why me why should i be subjected to such slaughter of what could have made an interesting plot at least if i can warn other people off it will have been worthwhilebr br i had to watch this horrible movie for a college course otherwise i would have looked at the synopsis on the back of the thing and steered clear the movie was slow had painfully little character development and centered around the idea that a creepy little white man can become cool if he hangs out with an lastyle token black manbr br if you want to experience the stereotypical la feeling of dizzying superficiality  watch the movie note though that this movie does not depict what we have come to think of as an la lifestyle it is a wonderful example of the products that arise from it
5,kudos to cesar montano for reviving the cebuano movie panaghoy sa suba is very good  it has the drama the action the romance and scene that will make you laughbr br while the story is not that original a love triangle  or make a fourcorneredlove japanese occupation rebellion american as lord its presentation is something cool especially it uses it original language  bisaya for the filipino nipongo for the japanese and english for the americanbr br this movie will go as one of this years best pinoy moviesbr br go watch this

7,hurrah a space film that doesnt take itself too seriously and everyone can come along for the exciting ride that is space camp the film starts slowly the usual mix of idiots and highfliers mixed together into a dodgy soup but when the going gets tough  the tough get themselves sorted out and its not an unbelievable change in the characters as you can believe that theres some responsibility in their young mindsbr br the only flaw in the film is that kate capshaw is extremely annoying as the im right and youre all wrong instructor i would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a vote
0,not worth the video rental or the time or the occasional effortsbr br makeup that a child can do acting was over donepoor directing editing was very choppymany things made no sense or just seemed gratuitous sound was badly dubbed music was highly inappropriate casting was extremely offmust have been on crack zombies that talk let alonedrive dance workjust pisses me off and the bad guyholy crap as horribly casted as he washe was the best looking zombie of all which doesnt say muchbr br the cover art was good but very deceivingas was the main menu of the dvdgreat artwork and musicbr br dont bother
4,michael caine has always claimed that ashanti was the only film he did purely for the money as well as the worst film he ever starred in hold on michael werent you in the swarm and hurry sundown and werent both of those films a good deal worse than ashanti perhaps caine remembers only too begrudgingly the physically punishing demands of filming an action film in searing 130 degrees fahrenheit temperatures the director richard fleischer was hospitalised as a result of sunstroke during the shoot what ashanti actually emerges as is not the career lowpoint of michael caine instead it is a very average chase thriller with a talented cast exotic locations boring stretches and a highly formulaic storylinebr br dr david linderby caine is a who medic who is left devastated when his black wife anansa beverly johnson goes missing during an aid trip to an african tribal village linderby gradually realises that his wife has been snatched by slave traders  led by suleiman peter ustinov  and he sets off on a continentwide pursuit which eventually leads to the middle eastbr br along the way big stars pop in for ineffective and superfluous guest roles william holden has a poor cameo as a chopper pilot omar sharif displays little of his customary charm or grace as a pampered arab millionaire rex harrison looks rightfully bored during his brief role as a helpful contact who assists caine in his quest the film is based on a bestseller entitled ebano by the littleknown author alberto vasquezfigueroa but the suspense that made the book so popular is largely absent in this adaptation ustinov is charismatic as the slaver he seems in all his movies to be incapable of giving bad performances and caine generates believable anguish as the man who thinks hell never see his wife again there are occasional flashes of action but on the whole ashanti is quite slowmoving all in all it is a resistible piece of action hokum  not by any stretch as awful as caine has frequently suggested but not a very inspiring film and certainly a letdown from all the talent involved
0,i just saw this at the venice film festival and cant quite decide about it we were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to care about them maybe that was the point that we are all in a bubble of our own but these people didnt compel me to be concerned about them or shocked at their various fates at a running time of just over an hour the characters werent very well developed lots of time was devoted to shots of factory equipment forklifts conveyor belts shovels and the slightlycreepylooking baby dolls with surprisingly lifelike eyes that most of the characters made for a living were somehow more interesting than the live people an interesting experiment but somehow it never quite came together
0,i really cant understand how could someone give this disgusting film more than star how can you like such a retarded film where all the animal abuse scenes are real i dont even want to imagine the excruciating pain those innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those horrific moments jesus what kind of human would torture them like that for no reason or just for money i tell you that director is either mentally retarded or hes just a monster with a heart of stone or both he truly deserves to get his hands cut off and burn alivebr br it contains various horribly barbaric scenes that may cause shock especially to sensitive persons and children a real frog is skinned alive fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water a dog is beaten birds are thrown into the waterbr br this movie is more than awful it has to be the worst and most retarded film ever made along with another one called cannibal holocaust or something like that ill never watch or buy any film directed by this heartless monster no one should waste their time watching it especially when there are a lot of truly great movies out there in which all the animal abuse scenes are stagedbr br fortunately only a few people liked this  which is natural since its the worst film ever  so it wasnt successful i hope this will make the retarded director realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to real animals will never be praised and that he will stage all the animal abuse scenes in his following films i truly believe that everyone receives but what they give there will be a day when all the retarded and cruel humans will feel the same pain they once inflicted to othersbr br this however is probably my only negative review i usually dont comment on a movie if i dislike it but this time i just couldnt shut up i had to speak the truth because animal abuse must stop

5,i like brad pitt enormously he is an actor with brains and wit not to mention face pectorals and all the rest since i saw him in thelma and louise a thought has been bothering me who does he remind me of troy did it for me he is the new brigitte bardot the differences are obvious of course male american etc but brigitte bardot comes to mind nonetheless he is so beautiful that he is at his most effective when he plays against it kalifornia 12 monkeys fight club snatch his self deprecating humor makes him human almost accessible fortunately troy will soon be forgotten only still photographs with pitt semi naked in ravishing sprint positions will decorate the walls of legions of salivating fans strange das boot is one of the great films of the second part of the 20th century what is wolfgang petersen doing directing this well i suppose it would be very hard to say no at the chance of working with the new brigitte bardot
6,even 20 years later ninja mission stands out as the worst movie i ever managed to sit through scandanavian ninjas silently enter a scene fire their obnoxiously noisy submachine guns with wild abandon and then silently leave wow how will we find those silent invisible assassins just follow the shell casings and smokepainfully bad dialog or was it brilliant and just poorly translated not an asian in sight in the cast and a whopping total of asians among the stunt crew the plot is ridiculous the acting pretty much nonexistent  then again ninja cant act save yourselves  avoid watching at all costs
1,i have no idea what people are complaining about i saw this movie yesterday and i really liked it stone once again delivered a great character she was just as good as she was in the first basic instinct she still has those smart but tricky answers although sharon may be 48 years old she looks amazing i dont care if shes as fake as a barbie she looks good and thats that basic instinct gives you everything you want from the first sex violence and a great ending that will leave you thinking and talking about it for hours half the people commenting on this movie havent even saw it so dont listen to them
0,what a piece of junk this movie was the premise was okay but even in the beginning with crappy effects to blend in a giant with normal sized people even the effects in hercules was better i knew this would be bad but the really awful part of the movie is the dialogs its completely incoherent silly and stupid i felt like it had been written by some 9th grader in creative class and gotten a d i want to slap casper van diem and the other actors for following this movie throughbr br ive had my share of cheesy and bad movies i love the tremors series but this i do not recommend it at all its silly and the totally flabbergastingly bad dialogs will make you cringe
3,i got to see an early preview of this movie and i hope they have time to edit it in what ever way they can to improve on it before it comes out aug 3rd it stars andy samberg from saturday night live as hot rod kimble hes plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stunt man like his late father when we meet him hes jumping a mail truck on his moped yes a moped and almost makes it this would be worthy of a jackass movie if he wasnt honestly trying to do this isla fisher plays the slightly older and much more mature girlnextdoor denise she seems to like rod enough to join his crew jorma taccone also snl plays his half brother kevin who documents the stunts with a camcorder sissy spacek plays rods mom marie she remarried frank powell played by ian mcshane franks a real tough guy who enjoys beating rod in some real drag out brawls its clear that rods not going to earn franks respect till he can beat him we find out frank needs a 50000 heart transplant and rod is determined to raise the money just so he can beat his ass once hes healed and prove himself a man a long fall down a mountain side convinces rod to go big on one stunt rod sets out to get seed money by charging for doing stunts that would make you cringe if you saw them in real life like the human torch at a childrens birthday party there were those at the showing who managed to laugh at most of the stunts just when all hope and money is lost along comes a sponsor who saves the day by getting the 15 school buses rod wants to jump he gets exclusive broadcast rights and sets up phone lines to get donations rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle the whole town turns out and the world tunes in does he make the jump does he get the girl do they raise the 50k does frank get his ass beat by rod wait till this 90 minute movie comes out on video to find out
0,this film is awful the cgi is the very cheap gray blob cgi the crocodile looks like a large gray smudge the worst is that no effort at all is given to making it walk or look like it is alive it is mostly a photoshopped cgi that is placed into scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that is moving the cgi smudge across the screen this is one of the worst examples of cgi effects that i have ever witnessed and i have seen lots of the very bad scifi channel moviesbr br aside from the terrible lack of special effects the cast is composed of the typical lowcost actors who probably work as waiterswaitresses at local diners while they wait for their big breaks perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys is attempting to sexually assault kate and the giant crocodile jumps straight up out of the water to the second floor of the villains headquarters and through the balcony and pulls the bad guy off kate and instead of crashing straight down through the building and crushing kate the croc just flies backwards at the same angle into the water no laws of physics can apply to this movie or the special effects at least there is honor among crocodiles
7,in nyc seaman michael ohara orson welles rescues elsa bannister rita hayworth from a mugging  rape as she takes a horse  carriage through central park and lives to regret it titianhaired hayworths a platinum blonde in this one as dazzling as freshfallen snow but nowhere near as purebr br to reveal any more of the convoluted plot in this seminal noir would be criminal its as deceptive as the mirrors used to cataclysmic effect in the final scenes but the film holds far darker secrets from the ny times childhood shadows the hidden story of the black dahlia murder by mary pacios mary pacios who was years old when she was befriended by 15 year old bette short retraces shorts steps interviewing friends and associates she also offered a detailed if speculative analysis of orson welles particularly in regard to his movie the lady from shanghai according to ms pacios the movie along with related archival materials has many of the same ritualistic elements associated with shorts murder she raises the question could welles have been the killer interesting theories and with the spate of books now out on the black dahlia much more may come to light fritz langs brutal film noir the big heat 1953 was a romanaclef telling of the dahlia killing in the city of nets that was la but its the orson opus that the dahlia had a handson connection to in reality it was bugsy siegel and the hollywood mob wars of the 1940s that did the dahlia in but that doesnt negate much of what pacios wrote almost all of hollywood intersected with elizabeth the black dahlia short and her taleauralegacycurse is encoded in a number of golden age filmsbr br the black dahlia was always on the peripheral edges of shanghaieven before it started filming barbara payton on franchot tone it was when he was thinking about making the lady from shanghai before he lost the option to orson welles franchot said hed been in a bad state over that deal when he ran into the dahlia in the formosa cafe across from the goldwyn studios the floor above the formosa cafe was bugsy siegels office and the dahlia one of his on againoff again working girlsbr br it gets deeper and darker after the 1951 brawl over barbara payton between tom neal and franchot tone that sent franchot to the hospital with a concussion and never talking the same way again barbara said she married tone just to spite neal tom detour neal also knew the dahlia who didnt and became obsessed from la despair by john gilmore the january 1947 slaying of the young beautiful wouldbe actress elizabeth short known as the black dahlia was one of the most grisly murders in the annals of modern crime a project called who killed the black dahlia was being kicked off by actor tom neal a hellraiser from ww ii movies potential producer gene harris someone will have to come up with a more imaginative business proposition than what has been presented by tom neal and his cohorts not long after it would be very clear one beautiful day to come when tom would sneak up on his pretty new palm springs wife as she lay on their sofa and shoot a 45 bullet through her head barbara payton and norma jean dougherty later marilyn monroe knew the dahlia and their stories are well known it seems all who crossed the path of the dahlia like the proverbial black cat entered a twilight zone darkness andor had an incredible string of bad luck afterward tonenealwelles are only a few and this includes a butchered film called the lady from shanghaibr br lady from shanghai took two years to be released thanks to extensive reediting and all because columbia president harry cohn couldnt understand the story its dark noir to be sure one of the darkest in fact its also a wicked satire on life in the new atomic agebr br nicolas christopherbr br shanghai pushes forth an insistent subtext of nuclear apocalypse and contains the definitive noir statement concerning the atomic bomb and the american city the films principal murder victim and there are many a psychotic and doubledealing lawyer manically foresees armageddon at every turn claiming he can feel it he announces that he plans to escape to a remote pacific island a particularly acid joke on welles part since this was the very year the us began testing atomic bombs at just such a place the bikini atoll relocating all the inhabitants and destroying the ecosystem by the time of bikini the erotic identification of hayworth with the bomb appears to have been institutionalized with the blessing of the military brass the first bomb dropped in the pacific testing ground in named gilda and has hayworths image in provocative dress painted directly on its casing br br its ironic that orson welles broad interpretation of an irishman is considered a detriment to the film by many welles is giving a clue to viewers that michael ohara is only the storyteller  not part of the story even though it revolves around him ohara contradicts the shark motif throughout the film sharks on a feeding frenzy wont stop until theres nothing left michael ohara lives to tell the tale elsa bannister causes a feeding frenzy during oharas trial and her netted chapeau suggests shes caged in so as not to devour the human spectators to a roman coleseum the spectators are on a feeding frenzy of their own gossiping and carrying on about elsa a human aquarium correlating to the san francisco marine museum sequence thats the human condition except for michael ohara and yet hell be spending his life trying to forget his past elsa or die trying elsa is part of michael and the tale eats its own tail in the end and the viewer is cautioned to stay out of trouble
0,collusion course is even worse than the typical evil white male corporate capitalist movie of the week this movie is less pleasant than a toothache jay leno can act hes good in his underrated debut movie the silverbears in which he gives a performance consist with the demands of his character this movie is so bad lenos character a sanctimonious buffoon is less annoying than moritas character a sanctimonious fool
6,if you loved deep cover you might like this film as well many of the poetic interludes fishburne recites in deep cover are from the lyrical script of once in the life a screen adaptation of a play that fishburne wrote if you love larry as much as i do youll love this film that is all larry all hot and all fleshed out of course there is gun play and illicit substance use this is a gangster movie of sorts after all but the script is beautiful and the story is touching even a little on the chick flick sidebr br amazing filmdark frightening sexy and exciting if you ever sneaked out at night or hung out in a clubhouse youll get the proper impact of the cramped sets metephorically echoing being trapped in the life full of clever foreshadowing and complex relationships this film is tightevery sentiment mirrored in the set dressing and camera shots good work
0,what happens when you give a homeless man 100000 as if by asking that question they are somehow morally absolved of what is eventually going to happen the creators of reversal of fortune try to get their voyeuristic giggles while disguising their antics as some kind of responsible social experimentbr br they take ted a homeless man in pasadena and give him 100000 to see if he will turn his life around then with only the most cursory guidance and counseling they let him go on his merry waybr br what are they trying to say money cant buy you happiness the homeless are homeless because they deserve to be or how about lift a man up  its more fun to watch him fall from a greater altitude they took a man with nothing to lose gave him something to lose and then watched him dump it all down the drain thats supposed to be entertainment they dress this sow up with some gloomy music and dramatic camera shots but in the end it has all the moral high ground of car crash videos  only this time they engineered the car crashes and asked what happens when you take down a stop sign
4,the bourne ultimatum 2007 review after a thrilling set of two we get the final installment heres my takebr br the bourne ultimatum has it all we have jason bournematt damon on the coattails of the ones who know everything he has been running for too long this time it endsbr br the bourne ultimatum has a great plot awesome writing fantastic direction suspense and some of the best action of the summer matt damon delivers possibly his best performance to date he has the conviction and swelling desire of the troubled assassinbr br there are some intelligent humor here and some fine suspense the reactions to certain events will have you either laughingin a good way or cheering on or both i heard a lot of intelligent laughter in the theater and lots of clapping the audience was loving itbr br the bourne ultimatum delivers all in a nicely giftwrapped package all of the goods and then some this is in my opinion the best movie this summerbr br the last word excellent conclusion the best of the trilogy this is how summer movie thrillers should be done i love the bourne trilogy
0,believe it or dont i have my very own dvd copy of this movie which i bought at walgreens for a great big whole dollar im still not sure if it was a dollar well spent or a dollar foolishly wastedbr br pretty amazing set designs and costumes apparently much thought and effort went into their making the set designs are very mexican in stylization i liked them a lot and santa is impressive one of the more impressive santas in moviedombr br im guessing the original intent and purpose of this movie was to be something uplifting and cheerful for a kids audience but somehow it comes across quite deranged in fact im left stunned at how deranged it isbr br maybe its the english dubbing that makes it seems so deranged and bizarre one of the reasons i prefer to experience movies in the original language they were made and the use of english subtitles as dubbing often gives an unintended strangeness the kid voices were at least dubbed with actual kid voices as opposed to women pretending to be kids which tends to sound very very weirdbr br did you know that demons in hell spend their free time dancing around doing ballet in their longjohns you didnt neither did i until i watched this movie one learns something new everydaybr br is this movie actually worth watching now thats a tossup i cant in good conscience recommend it to anyone as its quite disturbing in its own bizarre way yet its unintentional bizarreness is what makes it worth watching you decide what youre going to do i dunno for myself it made me feel uncomfortable seeing demons constantly doing cutesy ballet moves now thats just wrong
6,a weird witty and wonderful depiction of family life writer andrew marshall has written something that is funny foreboding and occasionally frightening yes dont be fooled by 2point4 childrens cheerful tune and bubbly characters the show has a dark side and at times can be quite chilling and thats whats so good about the show its not just a simplistic sitcom where every character is a 2d comic device the case with my family instead the characters are fully rounded individuals that show the full rollercoaster of human emotions the occasionally dark moments such as bill being supposedly haunted by a curse and ben waking up in a bizarre village are two examples of the show taking a surreal dark turn that help add a little depth of course the show is also incredibly funny and is a guaranteed to make you smile its a real shame eureka video have stopped releasing this comical gold on dvd veohcom is your last hope to get hold of episodes unavliable in the shops
3,i watched the malayalam movie boeing boeing made in 1985 which in turn is probably inspired by an english movie of same name long back the basic story of garam masala is the same  but it is told in a pathetic way the classy jokes replaced by routine ones which are found in normal hindi movies probably the director did this to suit the taste of hindi audience br br i havent seen the english original but had really enjoyed the malayalam film made by priyadarshan himselfwhich was a side splitting comedy back then of course the acting by mohanlalmukesh and sukumari who did the cooks role was so natural and spontaneousbr br probably i am too smitten by the malayalam film that i cannot tolerate even the smaller flaws in its hindi remake but i still feel that akshay kumar and john abraham have overacted paresh rawal has done a decent job  but doesnt reach anywhere near sukumaribr br but all in all its ok if one compares it to other recent hindi comedy movies
0,i too loved this series when i was a kid in 1952 i was and my family always watched this show my favorite character was the one played by marion lorne as a rather stuttering bumbling and very lovable aunt type person i can still recall her ubba bubba um um type comments as she would try and say something important and then when she came back and played aunt clara in bewitched it was great casting br br it was the first time that i can remember seeing walter matthau whose career i followed as a fan for many many yearsbr br i have a question if anyone can verify was the title or end credits music the swedish rhapsody by hugo alfven every time i hear it played on my classical radio station here in southern california it brings back memories of the image of mr peepers walking away with his back to the camera im not even certain if this image in my minds eye is correct
2,in complete contrast to the opinions of the other review this film actually was surprisingly good i reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichs obvious jokes and overacting all of which the trailer had promisedbr br however after minutes in i found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting with only one toilet humour gag over her dead body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and without spoiling anything too much some of the moments involving animals are hilariousbr br the staple ingredients of a good film are all there script director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy this film stands tallbr br sure you arent going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time
1,deathstalker is perfect for bfantasy movie fans this barely 80minute travesty of filmmaking features everything hecklers can ask fornonexistent plotting terrible acting save for at least a raspysounding old lady laughable scripting and schlock editing and bargainbasement style background settings there are no characters that come across as likable or interesting in particular the lead doesnt have anything appealing about him and the actors assembled barely do anything to rise above the fgrade material if thats not enough then how about the lack of a compelling plot which this movie has nothing of the sort to make deathstalker qualify as a major turkey i was also offended that the women in this movie barely serve any purpose other than to be topless andor scantily clad get raped have sex with the hero all of the above in addition the background music is hideous a bizarre mess of electronic noise cheesy choral bursts and blaring orchestral cacophony ear numbing and eye numbing all in one packed with nary a thing to keep one interested deathstalker is probably best suited for folks looking for something to laugh at and believe me theres plenty of that in here otherwise i do not recommend this 100thgrade conan wannabe to anyone in the least

2,this is a good movie but it is not recommended if you dont like intelligent movies its about two guys that wish that the world would go awayand thats exactly what they get the acting is great the ending was not predictableand it actually had a good story unlike most movies these days people complain about the movie being too simple or too boring i think they should just stick to movies like the toxic avenger i actually like b movies or the grim adventures of billy and mandy one note if you notice this this has exactly the same actors from cube except four actors make it two notes wait after the credits trust me on this one enjoy the movie
0,bad acting bad writing this was a poorly written film its too bad because it had some potential its not even close to american pie or something about mary as previous comments might have you believe rent it at dollar night from you local video store if youre kind of bored
5,this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen and i have quite an appetite for awful and good movies it could just have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongueincheek  la rocky horror picture show which was really very funny other movies like plan nine from outer space manage to be funny while apparently trying to be serious as to the acting it looks like they rounded up braindead teenagers and asked them to adlib the whole production compared to them tom cruise looks like alec guinness there was one decent interpretation  that of the older ghoulbusting broad on the motorcycle
6,claire denis debut is both a brave and selfassured one in this depiction of life towards the end of french colonialist cameroon she explores the relationships between men and women black and whitebr br with the black servant prote as the films primary object of desire and oppression the film enters taboo territory from the beginning denis builds a picture of life through a series of character relationships that keep the informed viewer fixed to the screen the mood of the film is captured perfectly by the camerawork and lack of lightingbr br a great discourse
1,unreal movie what were these people on a mix of french upstairs downstairs mating horsesporn not suggested its pretty full on for a film  bestiality with a bit of benny hill music  chase scenes thrown in its sounds crazy  its even more so to watch spoiler it plods along in a tedious fashion for quite a while then a lamb does a runner prompting woman in period dress to run off after it she goes into the woods where she is set upon by an erect penis attached to a man in a bearrat manky suit i put it like that as its obvious the penis is in charge  gets way too much screen time ejaculating for the most of it anyway in a nutshell it turns out she liked a bit of bearrat tadger  thats about it the rest is just padding end spoiler a film made to shock  offend thus getting talked about any publicity is good publicity i supposea waste of time really but the main event has to be seen to be believed its hard to imagine that anyone thought it was a good idea as they filmed it
5,there are times when finishing a film one wishes to have a refund for the time just spent this was one of those times i almost gave up with only 15 minutes left to endure and i wish i hadbr br the pace that a man goes from a straightlaced controlled life to one of complete spinelessness and irresponsibility could never be this rapidbr br from a graduation celebration to the predictable ending tristan price jesse metcalfe man of privilege and culture allows himself to be seduced by a woman by violence and by mind altering substances of course the woman part is understandable when observing the talents of the beautiful april nathalie kelley but the in for a penny in for a pound aspect of the drugs violence and dedication to a person he has just met is impossible to understandbr br frankly besides being able to stare at nathalie kelley and monica keena this film has no redeeming qualities save your money save your time do anything else
3,this was a typical grade b movie in 1940s hollywood and yet it succeeded way beyond its expectations why it has a wonderful plot and backed up by nina foch george macready and dame may witty as a female villain of all peoplebr br when a young lady answers an advertisement for a secretary she certainly gets more than she bargained for the only talents her employers are seeking are those which will lead to her demise seems that witty and macready want to pass her off as their daughterinlaw and wife respectively macready killed his real wife and wants to do foch in as well so that a body can be claimedbr br the film deals with how foch tries to get town people to believe her and how she is thwarted in practically everything she does why dont people believe her
1,this is by all categories the best movie i have ever seen forget hollywood  their movies always sucked  this is art moon childs story starts with kei  a japanese vampire who loathes what he has become and lives in denial his wish for final death leads him to mallepa where refugees from several asian countries live here he meets sho an orphan living on the streetbr br from here the movie is an intense experience which bases on the visual and emotional part of the movie it has everything you laugh you cry you get angry excited sad happy never has a movie touched me the way this movie do and the actors are amazing  never have i heard anyone speak so many languages without it sounding strange a big praise to the editor for creating this masterpiecebr br a last comment on this brilliant movie is that it stars gackt exvocalist of malice mizer and hyde vocalist of larcenciel in excellent roles as sho and kei i am amazed at how gackt can change his way of speaking and acting depending on what age he is acting outbr br this is a must see if you never see any films see moon child the crow brandon lee and the newly released masterpiece final fantasy vii  advent children all in their original languages of course
7,this adaptation of pearl s bucks film is certainly a classic a true hollywood epic it has all the things a great hollywood film has birth death happiness sadness exhilaration despair and so on there is only one thing that irks me i know it was a sign of the times but neither of the two main characters are played by asian actors paul muni was a great actor and he does an admirable job as wang lung the owner of a farm in china luise rainier plays olan she does not even look chinese i think she tried to get the role but they should have put anna may wong in the role i know why they didnt and ms rainier is very good in the film but they hardly tried to make her look authentic stillm its a great film especially if you read the book i did in high school decades ago its a must see just look beyond the casting i think you can
1,director edward sedgwick an old hand at visual comedy successfully leads this hal roach road show which tenders a fastmoving and adroit scenario and excellent casting employing a large number of roachs reliable performers although the film was originally plotted as a vehicle for patsy kelly sunny jack haley stars as joe jenkins a young kansan who sells his auto repair business and journeys to hollywood where he attempts to wangle a screen role for the girl he loves starstruck cecilia rosina lawrence sedgwick who prefers using the entire mgm studio as his set does so here as cecilia always ready for an audition is treated by a wouldbe paramour cinema star rinaldo lopez mischa auer to behindthescenes action of naturally a musical comedy featuring broadway headliner lyda roberti laurel and hardy provide several enjoyable interludes including their wellknown skit involving a tiny harmonica and we watch fine turns by such as joyce compton russell hicks and walter long on balance one must hand the bays to mischa auer who clearly steals the picture as an emotional movie star a role which he largely creates and to the director for his clever closing homage to busby berkeleys filmic spectacles
7,whalehunters pick on the wrong freaking whalebr br a group of yahoo whale exploitists capture a female and string her up by her tailfin the whales mate sees the whole thing including the moment the females unborn baby slips out and slops onto the deck captain nolan richard harris could tell that the big male is really mad by the way it stared him down as if to say get out of town before hightide br br this story of revenge has harris presence and bos beauty but not much else this was bos first released film though her first acting job was four years previous in and once upon a love released in 1981 as fantasies directed by john derekbr br ps today the date of this review november 20 is bo dereks birthday i hope bo has a whale of a good time get it whale heehee
0,born again is a substandard episode from season one it deals with the subject of reincarnation and just doesnt fly ive never been big on reincarnation and that could be part of my apathy toward this episode it does reference the tooms case which is some nice continuation from the previous episode but the positives end there which is unfortunate because that takes place at the beginning of the episode i think its ludicrous that a dead guy would chose to reincarnate in the body of a completely unrelated girl and he waits until the girl turns eight to start exacting revenge theres even a serious lack of witty mulder  scully dialogue to keep the episode afloat if youre into reincarnation maybe this episode is up your alley if youre not then at least you can learn what bradycardia is
0,its hard to believe people actually like this dreck i do think kids can enjoy it but to me its the kind of kid film parents cant bear to sit through predictable plot boring belushi and possibly the worst kid actor of all time i will give the director some of the responsibility for the kid but she was truly painful to watch i feel embarrassed for her now having people know it was her when she sang the star spangled banner i had to turn the sound offthen i came here and discovered they did that because she won star search ive always felt jim belushi should be ashamed to trade on the name of his wonderful sadly missed brother and this crap shows why zero stars
2,i thought this movie was very well done taking place in the mid 1950s everything looked accurate to me it was well cast and believable i dont usually care much for this type of movie because they just dont have any depth but i felt this movie delved in to the characters and you could feel how they felt you got to really know them and care about them it did take me back to my youth and let me reminiscent about a more innocent time this movie could be enjoyed by both male and female and by all age groups after the movie was over i wished there was a part two i wanted to know what happened to dani and her family this movie is bound to be a classic if you havent seen it you should try to catch it when it is on tv or rent it
2,why would a person go back to a person who kicks them in the teeth not once not twice but over and over againbr br this film teaches us that in order to find love we must accept abuse not just forgive it but fully accept it gosh no wonder my first relationship only lasted ten years i obviously wasnt embracing my inner masochistbr br as bucatinskys writing debut there are many wonderful aspects to this film however in order to justify the reunion of eli and tom more character development would have been helpful we are never acquainted with elis masochism in fact we are led to believe that he is not a masochist although toms psychoemotional sadism is highly evident
0,im a rather pedestrian person with somewhat lowbrow tastes however i occasionally try to raise the bar on my cultural awareness this movie was one of my attempts i was in awe throughout the entire movie i liked it so much that i got my own tape so i could see it again this is a very thoughtful and emotionally striking movie i saw it as a huge question to the viewer what is the depth of sacrifice to duty one can accept can be asked to accept should accept as a military member this is of course an important question to me this question weighs heavily on the viewer of this moviebr br recommended
4,i have to agree with some of the other comments and even go a step further br br nothing about this film worked absolutely nothing delmar our central character makes the decision to become a surrogate mother in order to earn enough money to buy a restaurant but along the way fall for a wise exjailbird at the same time her friend hortense is trying to get her lawyer boyfriend to finally marry her she also happens to be sleeping with marlon who is desperately in love with her then theres delmars brother jethro who gets involved with a former coke addict missy who reveals she was sexually abused by her adopted father on the sidelines we also have the eccentricmother who has an assortment of equally odd friends one of whom dies on the couch at the beginning of the film so far so good but after introducing these characters and story lines addressing life death grief and love in the first half the film simply loses direction br br if the writer had only selected one or two characters and allowed us to follow their stories maybe things would have been fine but equal screen time is given to all with the result that no one story or character is fully developed for instance why does delmar think she will be able to hand over her child in exchange for money especially when the prospective parents are a creepy bigoted lawyer and his semi alcoholic and depressed wife why is hortense so desperate to marry a man who is a jerk and clearly doesnt love her how is it missy manages to kick her coke habit overnight is jethro regularly drawn to women with overwhelming problems or is missy the exception has delmar and jethros mother always been on the eccentric side or is it a more recent development why is jethro so keen on cadillacs that he has one in the middle of his living room why did moses spend years in prison for stealing a car a relatively minor crime how does delmar manage to end up giving birth to moses baby when there is no suggestion that they ever had sex br br these questions are posed in the screenplay but sadly are never answered i can only assume they were answered in the original novel and that is why the writer felt the need to include it all in the script big mistake losing several subplots especially the hortense and marlon story which adds nothing to the overall film would have tightened things considerably and allowed more time to develop the delmar jethro and moses characters who are clearly more central to the plot and underlying themes than anyone else br br add to that the most pedestrian directing style seen outside of the average soap opera and the result is a huge missed opportunity for all including jorja fox who does her best to rise above the material im not surprised that this appears to have been the directors last film as this effort shows no evidence of a visual style or ability to tell a moving and intelligent story
4,its a hideous little production apt to give one nightmares as well as headaches its an unsightly blend of live action and ugly stopmotion animation its weird but its not the kind of fun weird trip anyone optimistic might expect its the cold inhuman unfriendly sickening even creepy kind of weird there is absolutely no reason to watch this movie after all disney did a fantastic job with the same source material and cosgrovehall did far more attractive things with stopmotionbr br interestingly this is a french production as such it reenforces the stereotype that the french have no concept of scary
0,dudley moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic this film is very witty film that relies hugely on the actors talent without dudley moore john gielgud liza minnelli and a few others this film could have been a disaster it is not always well shot and at times has some very corny music that tries to force a mood the psycholike music at the wedding fight but the acting overcomes it the character arthur is hilarious with his drunken comments but he develops well into a more mature well rounded character as he learns to live by his own free will the end is fairly corny though i wont give it away but it could be improved worth seeing many times
7,coming immediately on the heels of match point 2005 a fine if somewhat selfrepetitive piece of serious woody scoop gives new hope to allens small but diehard band of followers among whom i number myself that the master has once again found his form a string of disappointing efforts culminating in the dreary melinda and melinda 2004 and the embarrassing anything else 2003 raised serious doubts that another first rate woody comedy with or without his own participation as an actor was in the cards happily the cards turn out to be a tarot deck that serves as scoops clever maguffin and proffers an optimistic reading for the future of woody allen comedybr br even more encouraging woodys selfcasting  sadly one of the weakest elements of his films in recent years  is here an inspired bit of selfparody as well as a humble recognition at last that he can no longer play romantic leads with women young enough to be his daughters or granddaughters in scoop allen astutely assigns himself the role of sid waterman an aging magician with cheap tricks and tired stagepatter who much like woody himself has brought his act to london where audiences  if not more receptive  are at least more polite like chaplins calvero in limelight 1952 sid waterman affords allen the opportunity to don the slightly distorted mask of an artist whose art has declined and whose audience is no longer large or appreciative moreover because they seem in character allens ticks and prolonged stammers are less distracting here than they have been in some time br br watermans character also functions neatly in the plot his fake magic bodydissolving box becomes the ironically plausible location for visitations from joe strombel ian mcshane a notorious journalistic muckraker and recent cardiac arrest victim introduced on a river styx ferryboattohades strombel repeatedly jumps ship because he just cant rest in eternity without communicating one last scoop about the identity of the notorious tarot killer unfortunately his initial return from the dead leads him to watermans magic show and the only conduit for his hot lead turns out to be a journalism undergraduate sondra pransky scarlett johansson who has been called up from the audience as a comic butt for the magicians climactic trick sondra enthusiastically seizes the journalistic opportunity and drags the reluctant waterman into the investigation to play the role of her millionaire father as demonstrated in lost in translation johansson has a talent for comedy and the querulous byplay between her and allen is very amusing  and all the more so for never threatening to become a prelude to romancebr br scoops serial killer plot involving grisly murders of prostitutes and an aristocratic chief suspect peter lyman hugh jackman is the no doubt predictable result of allens lengthy sabbatical exposure to londons ubiquitous jack the ripper landmarks and lore yet other facets of scoop as of match point also derive from woodys late life encounter with english culture its class structure manners idiom dress architecture and yes peculiar driving habits give woody fresh new material for wry observation of human behavior as well as sharp social satire when for instance sondra is trying to ingratiate herself with peter lyman at a ritzy private club waterman observes from his point of view were scum a good deal of humor is also generated by the contretemps of stiffly reserved british social manners encountering watermans insistent borschtbelt jewish plebeianism and then of course there is watermans hilarious exit in a smart car he cant remember to drive on the left side of the roadbr br as usual allens humor in scoop includes heavy doses of injokes taking the form of sly allusions to film and literary sources as well as increasingly references to his own filmography in addition to the pervasive jack the ripper references for instance the films soundtrack is dominated by an arrangement of griegs the hall of the mountain king compulsively whistled by hans beckert in m the first masterpiece of the serial killer genre the postfuneral gathering of journalists who discuss the exploits of newly departed joe strombel clearly mimics the opening of broadway danny rose 1984 references to deconstructing harry 1997 include the use of death as a character along with his peculiar voice and costume the use of mandelbaum as a character name and the mention of adair university harrys alma mater and where sondra is now a student moreover the systematic use of greek mythology in the underworld river cruise to hades recalls the use of greek gods and a chorus in mighty aphrodite 1995br br as to quotable gags allens scripts rely less on oneliners than they did earlier in his career but scoop does provides at least a couple of memorable ones to a question about his religion waterman answers i was born in the hebrew persuasion but later i converted to narcissism and sondra snaps off this putdown of watermans wannabe crimedetecting if we put our heads together youll hear a hollow noise all in all scoop is by far woody allens most satisfying comedy in a decade
2,stuck in a hotel in kuwait i happily switched to the channel showing this at the very beginning first pachelbels canon brought a lump to my throat then the sight of a tiger moth which my grandfather my father and i have all flown produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then crowes name hooked me completely i was entranced by this film crowes performance again the subject matter and yes what a debt we owe how various matters were addressed and dealt with the flying sequences my father flew avro ansons too the story  and as another contributor pointed out crowes recitation of high flight i wont spoil the film for anyone but separated from my wife by 4000odd miles as an exarmy officer who was deployed in a couple of wars and as private pilot i admit to crying heartily a couple of times buy it rent it download it beg borrow or steal it  but watch itbr br ps did i spy a bristol blenheim in yellow training colourson the ground looked like a twinengine aircraft with a twin303 brownings in a dorsal turret
0,you know those films that have you trapped in the cinema youre stuck there in the best seat in the house centre of the row in your own special sweet spot that you swapped three times before you got just the right seat  and after about what feels like 13 hours you are still trapped there uncomfortable and itchy thinking when the f is this film ever going to end you know the feeling  think of ai and the villagebr br well visitor q delivers a weird variant of that feeling i sat there for the first 30 minutes wondering when the thing was going to fing start it is interminable so arty it hurts this is the first miike takashi film i have watched apparently he makes films by the dozen and if they are all pretentious wnk like this i suspect it will be the lastbr br im not against pretentious wnk david lynch is up there amongst the top 10 directors for me but visitor q is cutrate cheap and nasty pretentious wnk br br as you may have worked out by now  i hated it
3,the plot was quite interesting with the russian revolution background i also enjoyed seeing budapest as the movie was partly filmed there sadly there was zero chemistry between the main characters so it was hard to believe the love story between them the love scenes were forced and mechanical jordan kirckland was really stiff almost icy rob stewart was quite charming and boyish so she looked like his older sister rather than his girlfriend the ending when we finally figure out who was actually after them was quite weak and made no sense whatsoever i think i would have enjoyed this movie a lot better if the relationship between the actors was slightly more credible
2,prisons are not exactly renowned for their kind hospitality and happy vibes what with stories of fights chaos murder and of course extreme male bonding but the prison in this film is a different beast altogether horror films set in cells are as you probably know nothing particularly new as they emphasis and exaggerate the fear of claustrophobia and the inability of escape  two of the greatest themes in horror cinema with such examples as the chair waldermar korzeniowsky 1988 the green mile frank darabont 1999 alien david fincher 1992and of course the entire women in prison exploitation genre itself another entry into this niche has to be something inventive and a lot of fun to boot in order to be recognised or at least thats what youd have thought prison is certainly an incredibly fun and enjoyable ride and its somewhat of a shame that it isnt as well known as it should bebr br the film in short centres on an old prison well duh which has been reopened however its not just fellow inmates and guards the prisoners have to fear but also a mean ass demon ghost spirit with only one thing on its mind death and boy are we treated to some awesome death scenes i wont spoil anything here for you but there are plenty of innovative and enjoyable murders all done by invisible handsbr br besides the special effects and the murders this film also has another thing going for it its cast headlining we have lord of the rings peter jackson 20012003 star viggo mortensen and for all those so inclined yes he does get naked whose performance is not only highly believable but is done with such skill that his eastwoodesquire character is both badtothebone and likable a very delicate mix add him to a cast of heywaitaminuteiknowthatguy actors and youve got yourself one great set of stars the characters themselves however lack threedimensionality and more often than not come across as very stereotypical weve got a black oculist a hardasnails prison warden a humanrights activist woman and plenty of other stock characters but in all honesty this fault actually aids the film instead of boring character development in an overlong equilibrium we are chucked more or less straight into the action and once it gets going very early on theres not a single scene thats a filler  its balls to the wall plot unlike a certain shawshank redemption frank darabont 1994  sharing conventions with the slasher genre this is somewhat of a convention itself and in good ol slasher genre tradition prison punishes those who have been badbr br all in all this is an excellent little horror film and one which is sadly overlooked and unmentioned among the horror world with an excellent cast and great special effects and rather original death scenes this film is highly recommended to horror fans dont be fooled into thinking itll be a cheesy little film either just because it was made in usa 1980s its far from cheesy although the very end does ruin this and simultaneously far from gritty and realistic whilst it attempts to tackle issues such as prison rape these are rather subtly donebr br i give it 35 out of luvs a very entertaining horror film with some very nice touches indeed
0,this is one of the greatest 80s movies it sticks out like a turd in a punchbowl i cant believe mad magazine denounced it or whatever and yet they proudly put their name on a show with stuart ispeakanoenlish chinese lady and ups guy on speed whats up with that and i love ron leibmanhes foxy wonder why he had his name removed from the credits it was his funniest role that i know of of course hes not nearly as foxy as he was in norma rae but in my opinion this movie is right up there with national lampoons vacation if you liked movies such as porkys fast times last american virgin or any of the other 80s teenfocused movies youll love this one rent it and youll see what i mean
1,okay im not going to critique this film in depth i note the many elogious reviews in advance of me and as i generally like maria de medeiros i have been long hesitant to make a disparaging comment  and in such fashion nearly a year has passed but each time i see that dvd on my shelf i sense an inner groan anyway let the elogious voices override me but for other cinephiles like me  bewarebr br expressed in simplest and gentlest terms heres my stancebr br the political turmoil and overthrow providing the backdrop for this film also served as a backdrop for a certain period of my life  via newspapers i read daily in my local middleeuropean pub at that time i followed the newsreports but never fully grasped what the heck was transpiring the reporters tended to report either in nonpartisan terms or with a conservatism which frowned upon any groups disturbing the peace or fomenting rebellion against the establishment those were times when other winds of unrest swirled through paris berlin prague and various places in the us all of whose issues i understand clearly at the time  but dictatorship or not my papers tended to treat the govermentment of portugal simply as the establishment  not as a wellfleshed out evil empire to use flippant star war termsbr br so week after week i read of disturbances but never found an intelligent editorial that might provide the history behind them or evaluate the practices and socialeconomic impacts of the dictatorship etcbr br so in purchasing this film i had at least two hopes to finally understand the details leading up to the social unrest and to enjoy a wellconceived drama this film gave me neitherbr br the film presupposes that viewers already have ample knowledge and deep emotions regarding the historical facts and the drama  well as i said i want to encourage maria de medeiros and the portugues film industry but  it was trite and shallowbr br i obtained my copy of the dvd from france  selection official cannes 2000  un certain regard the box shows smiling cleanshaven actors the lead giving the victory sign in a fashion that reminds me more of the playboy bunny after seeing the work i wondered what the french could have thought of it  though as a shallow piece of cinema verite with sensitive ethnic content i can understand their natural inclination to praise it for its honesty butbr br look at the back of the box un regard chaleuruex sur la revolution  a warm regard try describing allendes overthrown and murder with a a warm regard try it with czechoslovakia in 1968 try it with the whole lineup of overthrows and civil rebellionsbr br another review maria de medeiros a renoue avec son pays son enfance et son histoire rubbish rubbish rubbish at least for mebr br i love portugal in all of europe lisbon barcelona and prague are my favorite cities but my love for a city and a country doesnt flesh out a vacuous film ill hang on to my ancient vhs tapes of capas negras and a cancao de lisboa  meanwhile im stuck with a zone by the above title that might as well go in the trash
3,the only other review of this movie as of this date really trashes the stars and the movie itself i usually like to read the user comments to give me an idea of what to expect from a movie i dont know much about its unfortunate when there arent many comments for a certain tile because when there is only one review and it unreasonably trashes the movie and cast you dont get an idea of what to expect i read the review before watching this title and i dont know where all the venom for this movie and the stars came from douglas and blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually delivered even when the material was not the greatest i found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable it isnt one of the great alltime classics but a pleasant and funny diversionmuch more than you can hope for in most newer movies if you are a fan of these stars you will not be disappointed
0,kirsten dunst is terribly overrated as an actress you can tell always shes just acting i like izzard though plot is awfully boring the viewer has no real connections to the characters never knowing who to really sympathize with or even care about slow dull movie with some laughs but few and not very funny anyway plot is not engaging or suspenseful in the least you can see each plot turn coming a mile away what is this movie supposed to be comedy drama who cares you wont by the end of this film
0,i married a japanese woman 14 years ago were still togetherbr br however in the 1950s it would never have been as easybr br life in the military had been mined for action drama and comedy for years by this point mined to death the mixed relationships gave it new ground to cover this is old hat today but then marrying an asian back then meant you either owed somebody something or you were a freak of some sort this touched on both possibilities along with the third maybe it is love br br brando did his usual good job garner did a better job than he usually does hes good but this showed how good he could be umeckichan had a helluva debut here and while i think she earned her statue she didnt really stretch it was a role that no one who hadnt been overseas would have recognized and the newness was the corkerbr br the real scene stealer was red buttons red was the best thing in this film bank on it and the japanese lifestyles were shown in an admirable light as wellbr br a classic
2,hey arnold is a slowpaced and slightly boring movie the plot is not very creative the paul sorvino character shenk is buying all of the decrepit lowpriced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall shopping complex and office buildings this plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies it is boring paul sorvino is not very exciting either so the idea of him as the bad guy is not very scary gramps remembers something about a historical document and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when arnold and jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of helga whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to shenks mall the kids must move around town on buses and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly but underscores how this movie is written for very young kids hey arnold the tv cartoon is usually very entertaining and it has enough humor to appeal to adults the tv cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie hey arnold the movie is about five times more sedated and a good way to put anyone including kiddies to sleep hey arnold was a tough one to stay awake all the way until the predictable and totally boring ending if you want to send your kids to a totally nonoffensive movie this is it i get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie the producers started out with a 30 minute tv cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes this mall story definitely could have been covered in the tv cartoon hopefully arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel
1,im glad that i saw this film after mrsandler became famousbr br it is badbadbadbad there is no plot its like watching a painfully dull home moviebr br i really enjoy his other filmsbut if youre a fan like mestay away from this one it may change your thoughts on adam you may never recover from the horror that is this filmive had a better time watching old folks play scrabble in a home
6,felt it was very balanced in showing what jehovahs witnesses have done in protecting american freedoms it also showed the strong faith of two families who were first generation witnesses i also appreciated how it showed how by becoming a jehovahs witness affects nonwitness family members and how hard it is for them to accept the fact that they dont celebrate holidays the sad part is that nonwitness families do not think of having their witness family over for family dinnersvisits or give them gifts at any other times but for holidays or birthdays when it comes to medical care the witnesses want and expect a high standard of medical care what people forget is that blood transfusions allow for sloppy medical care and surgeries whereas bloodless treatments causes the medical team to be highly skilled and trained which would you prefer to treat your loved ones i highly recommend this video
1,this is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes the money pit and are we done yet only points out all the more how the 40s movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since regretfully been lostbr br i was 15 when i first saw this and even at that tender age there was much i could laugh at now of course being familiar with adult frustrations i see a whole lot that i missed as a youthbr br the three main actorscary grant myrna loy and melvyn douglasinteracted perfectly but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream its never as easy and free of unseen complications as one envisionsbr br all in all this is a classic comedy which still stands above the attempts to remake it
5,i just thought it was excellent and i still do im grateful were still able to see different stuff from what hollywood almost floods us with saving grace is smart and enjoyable  those who feel offended by the marijuana thing better go see the americas bride sort of moviebr br saving grace also shows that a funny movie doesnt have to be stupid i was laughing my ass off during most of it but also pondering questions about what was the female lead character supposed to do to pay her deceased husbands debtsbr br in a nutshell  a witty storyline with typical english humour and good acting and directing you couldnt ask for morebr br 710
2,the ring was made from the only screenplay hitchcock wrote himself and it deals as many of his earliest pictures do with a love triangle at first glance it looks like a more cynical update of the infidelitythemed morality comedies of cecil b de mille but more than that it is the first really competent hitchcock picture even if he was not yet using the ideas and motifs of suspenseful thrillers he was at least developing the tools with which to create suspensebr br as well as being a student of the german expressionist style the rhythmic editing style of sergei eisenstein had had its impact upon hitchcock but here he keeps tempo not just with the edits but with the content of the imagery this is apparent from the opening shots where spinning fairground rides brilliantly establish a smooth tempo and like eisenstein the editing style seems to suggest sound  for example when a splitsecond shot of the bell being rung is flashed in we almost subconsciously hear the sound because the image is so jarringbr br there is also a contrast particularly with silent films from the us in that the ring is not cluttered up with too many title cards as much as possible is conveyed by imagery and hitch has enough faith in the audience to either lipread or at least infer the meaning of the bulk of the characters speech and its not done by contrived symbolism or overacting its all done by getting the right angles and the right timing particularly with pointofview shots as well as some strong yet subtle performances there are unfortunately a few too many obvious expressionist devices particularly double exposures many of which were unnecessary but there is far less of this than there is in the lodgerbr br lets make a few honourable mentions for the aforementioned actors first up the stunningly handsome and very talented carl brisson in the lead role in spite of his talent i was at first a bit confused as to why he got the role as to be honest he looks more like a ballet dancer than a pugilist but that just goes to show how much i know as it turns out brisson was in fact a former professional boxer and inexperienced in acting playing his rival is the competent ian hunter who would go on to have a lengthy career in supporting roles right up to the 60s the most demanding role in the ring has to be that given to lillian halldavis torn between two lovers she pulls it off very well however with an emotive understated performance and its a shame her career never lasted in the sound era and last but not least the great gordon harker provides some comic relief in what is probably his best ever rolebr br the rings climactic fight scene is among the most impressive moments of silentera hitchcock martin scorcese may have had his eye on the ring when he directed the fight scenes in raging bull as his watchword for these scenes was stay inside the ring the fight in the ring starts off with some fairly regular long shots but when the action intensifies hitchcock drops us right in the middle of it with closeups and pointofview shots hitchcocks aim always seems to have been to involve his audience and this was crucial in his later career where the secret of his success was often in immersing the viewer in the characters fear or paranoiabr br the ring really deserves more recognition than the inferior but better known the lodger its a much more polished and professional work than the earlier picture and probably the best of all his silent features
2,that 70s show is definitely the funniest show currently on tv i started watching it about two and a half years ago and as soon as i saw it i could tell it was a great show i like all the characters but my personal favorites are fez and kelso leo was also an awesome character while he was there i really hope he comes back because hes hilarious its classic when fez goes you son of a bitch and when kelso yells burn that always makes me laugh they are both great characters and always have something funny to say jackie being hot is just another reason to watch the show she started out being really good looking but damn somewhere around season 56 she just got really hot ive seen most of the episodes more than once some like 10 times and there still hilarious this is one of the few shows that i can watch over and over and still laugh at just as much as i did the first time i saw it the cast is classic almost everyone is funny where with many shows there are only a few funny characters i will be sad to see this show end next year but it will be going off the air as one of the best shows ever
7,overall this movie was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many more generations to come although the plot is not 100 accurate to the book most everything is correct the movie does skip far ahead and does miss some important parts i found the book and ready and immediately wished that they had made a movie because i hadnt found out about the movie yet but later i found the movie in a bargain bin at walmart and decided to buy it and see if it was what i had expected overall i give this movies a out of 10 for its good parts relative accuracy and overall making sense and for its bad parts large time skips and small but noticeable inaccuracies
5,although in many ways i agree with the other reviewers comments i find that the plot and idea are very good many of the supporting actors were very good the fatal problem with this film is ellen pompeo i am sure i have never seen a less talented actor how this person has ever been in a film or on television i cannot imagine in my opinion she would be better as a greater at a walmart to see a person with this low level of talent involved in paying roles does beg the question who does she know i would very much like to see this film remade with some talent i do not fault the writer for the failure of this film to be worth the time to view it
5,i love jacks jokes like the clich is or over the top clich guy black oily skin kinda spooky he is just hilarious daniels starting to catch up on him to good thing jacks not on the team anymore in a way or else it would have been sarcasm maniai just love all the plots season a little less i have to admit the characters are great the actors are great im starting to pick up facial expressions and more from jack daniel and tealcit just all theoretically possible and excitingoops their i go again sorry im also starting to pick up traits from carter and all of this is driving my parents nutz well to conclude i think its good for another three seasons or so especially if they keep on packing the episodes with all this humor drama action and so forth
7,i caught a bit of this concert on public television and knew i had to have it the boys give everyone at the royal albert an excellent often thrilling performance complete in every way pure too  no synth no smokeshrouded lasers and strobes no grandiose entrance and an unstoned serious and appreciative audience all of whom left their bottle rockets at homebr br if youre a cream fan or if youve only heard of them if youre a blues fan if youre a rock n roll fan you will not be disappointed when you view and listen to this dvd you also will never lose this dvd because youll never lend it to anyone this dvd justifies selfishness tell them to get their own its too good and too replayable youll want to keep it within easy reach
7,little edie and big edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for even though their house was filthy this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness on the message board a poster wrote that little edie has the coping skills of an eight year old this reminded me of when in the dramatized 2009 version big edie says to little edie if youre stuck its only with yourself these women had everything beauty talent intelligence firm belief in their opinions and actions perhaps if little edie wasnt so hard on herself the first time things didnt work out losing her hair her job and the love of her life she would have made it this somehow ties into what i believe is her mental illness her inability to pick herself up when times are hard and see that good times lie ahead the world will never know what have happened if she didnt listen to her moms plea come home edie let me take care of youbr br yet these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant heartbreaking and lovable even in their extremely filthy home these women were extraordinary and their interaction with each other bring humor and sadness when edie had one of her emotional breakdowns dwelling about what could have been or about how she wants to get out of her home because she feels like a little girl one gets the intense urge to hug her and tell her that everything will be okay br br great documentarybr br 910
1,since was only a toddler when this show originally aired i just recently picked up the dvd set and am wishing there were more episodes filmed this show was a 70s version of the poplular 90s tv series xfiles but with a bit more of a comediclight hearted approach but dont get me wrong some of these episodes have full on horror themes many in which have some pretty greuesome plots left to the imagination of course this was the early 70s televisionbr br some of the plots where a bit silly as well as the acting but that is the charm and attraction to this series whether you like mystery crime dramas comedies or scifihorror themes this series brought all that together each episode clocked in at around 50 minutes or so hour with commercials and that 50 minutes goes by quick always leaving me wanting more a great classic show that is underrated in my book
5,singleton has some serious issues he has to come to grips with i get the feeling that he thinks he is pretty smart however this movie is almost comically transparent and self righteous in addition there are a bunch of mightmakesright messages like when our local nazi jerks get beat up i mean who in their right mind is going to root for a bunch of nazi jerks however he way singleton portrays the fight is downright silly and seems to be designed to show us more the superior fighting qualities of the black protagonists than anything else there is another bad guy in reality a drunken frat boy who rapes one of the movies protagonists in this instance i think that singleton actually does a nice job portraying what is probably an all too common situation when the woman involved asks the frat boy to use a condom and he either does not have one or does not want to use one in any event he does not accede to her demands that he stop and he proceeds to have intercourse despite her pleas i think that this type of rape is all too common and in fact many uniformed people refuse to accept the fact that it is even a rape well no means no this is a rape which probably occurs a lot in universities across the countrybr br having established the rape how does singleton deal with it when the frat boy tries to call the woman her roommate refuses to put the victim on the phone at which point the frat boy calls the roommate a black bitch the aggrieved roommate appears to appeal to a counsel of ice cube et al who then proceed to physically humiliate and abuse the frat boy into repeated and prolonged apologies to roommate for his racist remarks however the apparently in singletons mind lesser crime of rape is not mentioned again no one really should feel sorry for the frat boy however singleton seems to be sending a dual message that a racist comment is a greater offense then rape and in any event violence is justified against jerksbr br what is so ultimately so disappointing is that this movie could have truly been about something important but singleton while no doubt a talented director does not appear to have the maturity or depth to pull of something of this magnitude
1,tainted look at kibbutz lifebr br this film is less a cultural story about a boys life in a kibbutz but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general in the first two minutes of the movie the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves and its all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical kibbutznikim besides the two main characters a clinically depressed woman and her young son every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of wellevil br br the story centers on how the kibbutz like some sort of cult slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows there is no happiness no joy no laughter in this kibbutz every charactersituation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny hypocrisy violence cultism repression etc for example while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome european looking 12 year old boy  his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his jewish physical appearance and brutish personality he cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother he treats these volunteers like trash after his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasnt seen in a long time due to his military service he orders quote  linda go take shower and i cum in two minutes br br there is one other good character in this movie  a european foreigner who plays the mothers boyfriend when the animal rapist tries to hit the mothers son the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapists arm he is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for violent behavior against one of the kibbutz members more hypocrisy the indescribably annoying french woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age 18 or without love and gives an account of the actual act thats supposed to be humorous for the audience but is really just stupid she of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boys mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse br br the film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders the mother apparently cant escape the kibbutz although in reality anyone wasis always free to come and go as they choose its a mystery how the boys father died but you can rest assured the kibbutz drove him to it and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son br br thats the gist of this movie one dimensional characters over dramatization dry performances and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audiences head  that kibbutz life was degrading miserable and even deadly for those who didnt fit in i feel sorry for the guy who made this film  obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz but i feel as though he took a few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs
3,i saw this film yesterday i rented the dvd from blockbuster in fact i know one of the actresses from the film i wont say who thats kept under wraps but i must admit it wasnt as good as i thought it would be tom savini hats down to this guy but its a shame he wasnt in the film for long what lacks the film is the idea the script sound etc it may look like a good movie but it wasnt that entertainingbr br well im glad my sister paid 10 for renting dvds from blockbuster i chose this one and i was disappointed anyway thumbs down for me not my cup of tea out of 10
0,many have stated that orca  killer whale is a jaws ripoff this is not really true though the enormous commercial success of jaws undoubtedly made these man vs beast stories more attractive propositions for filmmakers in the second half of the 70s orca  killer whale would be better described as a modernday retread of moby dick its a story about obsession on one hand a whales obsessive quest to avenge the death of its mate on the other a bounty hunters obsessive quest to kill the whale before it can claim any more lives sadly orca killer whale emerges a very disappointing film its fundamentally interesting ideas somewhat ruined by hammy performances and preposterous plottingbr br shark hunter nolan richard harris encounters a marinelife researcher rachel bedford charlotte rampling diving off the atlantic coast of canada their meeting almost ends in disaster when rachels team are attacked by a great white shark but a killer whale arrives in the nick of time to stop the shark after this nolan becomes increasingly obsessed with capturing a killer whale and selling it to an aquarium but his plans backfire when he accidentally kills a pregnant female of the species while the distraught male looks on rachel tells nolan that a killer whale is an incredibly intelligent mammal with a strong memory and feelings just like a human worse still native umilak will sampson warns him that the whale will always remember its grief and do everything it can to have revenge nolan initially tries to forget about the whole regrettable incident but the whale causes havoc in the fishing town and the disgruntled locals begin to demand that nolan puts to sea to track it down and destroy it eventually nolan is forced to pursue the killer whale the hunt leads all the way to the desolate ice floes of the arctic ocean where man and beast play out their final fatal battle against each otherbr br two things stand out in this film one is the haunting score by ennio morricone perhaps the greatest composer of film music of alltime his talents wasted on various tenthrate clunkers during the 70s and 80s the other is the amazing widescreen photography of ted moore which makes the film consistently pleasing to the eye in every other department orca  killer whale is a shoddy film that does nothing to enhance the reputation of its talented cast and crew harris appears extremely ill throughout the film his hair bedraggled black rings around his eyes and skin deathly pale his performance lacks the usual vitality rampling strikes a lot of sexy poses but fails to convince with her longwinded and illinformed explanations about the ways of whales the rest of the actors are wasted in brief and undeveloped roles the most memorable of which sees bo derek getting her leg bitten off by the vengeful whale the plot is total nonsense from start to finish with such preposterous sequences as the whale deliberately starting a fire in the fishing village that engulfs and destroys the local refinery although its credible to suppose that whales are intelligent creatures with genuine emotions the idea that a whale could plot revenge against a single human adversary and carry it out so calculatedly is utterly absurd orca  killer whale is really one for completists of the man vs beast cycle from the late 70s most will come away from the film shaking their heads in disbelief and grinding their teeth with despair
3,i honestly dont understand how tripe like this gets made the worst juniorhigh talent show skit youve ever seen is more entertaining than this film will ferrells wrestling fetish provides the only briefly humorous moments utterly horrible
5,well executed old and very dark house horror good setup which includes the character of poe himself alluding to the story in a london pub although from here it is pretty much the one guy who has taken the dare to visit the house on a particular night running from room to room either looking for or avoiding people it is still most enjoyable plus we have the delightful and enigmatic barbara steele there is some wooden dialogue and some unexplained bits and bobs but it is the super creepy atmosphere that is maintained throughout that and the super musical score that keep this one moving nicely along dvd originates from us and has a few extras
1,this movie should not be viewed unless you are trying to kill yourself i think this movie could actually cause severe brain damage the main characters are the whiny nonhero kevin amy his bratty ungodly conservative girlfriend kyle a dork in red shorts who enjoys phone sex daphne a scrawny horny girl who is supposed to be cool and has no sense of how to dress and her oversexed boyfriend nick an army recruit who can make an innuendo out of anything no im not a pervert thats really how the movie goes the movie itself is an oversexed ripoff of 1986s gremlins only youll never find a trace of gizmo anywhere no these hobgoblins unleashed by wimpy man im sorry kevin make someones wildest dreams come true and then kill the victims yes you guessed iteventually they wind up in a strip club where the nerdy amys greatest dream is revealedshe wants to be a stripper look i watched this flick via mst3k and even with mike nelson tom servo and crow t robot making a laughingstock out of this cinematic trainwreck and it still made me bleed from both eyes not really but i wish i had im not giving you anymore plot because reliving it gives me this great urge to drive a pitchfork through my brain besides its not like theres a plot worth mentioning they should put a surgeons general warning on this film
5,why does this have such a low rating i really dont get it is it because of the bad acting the bad dialogue well who cares about these things in cheesy lowbudget horror movies seriously the acting and the dialogue isnt important in those movies people who hate movies only because of bad acting and bad dialogue shouldnt be allowed to rate cheesy lowbudget movies those movies shouldnt be taken seriously periodbr br anyway time to talk about the movie right well i loved it i bought it because i expected a gorefest but its not a gorefest and the gore is pretty bad most of the time its just animal guts placed on the body of the actors and thats lame but i didnt really care because the movie is hilarious the characters are hilarious the acting is hilarious bad acting is a good thing in cheesy lowbudget horror movies the dialogue is hilarious bad dialogue is a good thing in cheesy lowbudget horror movies the zombie rapist with a huge dick is hilarious the flying demon baby is hilarious and i could go on and on and on but i dont want to say too much but i have to mention that theres a scene in which a girl masturbates a sex doll like its alive lol oh and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll lolbr br best lines in the moviebr br detective manners sniffs coke detective sloane what the beep are you doing manners what the hell did you snort what the hell is that detective manners its nothing man its ehh cold medicinebr br detective manners injects heroin in his arm detective sloane what the beep are you doing manners are you beep insane detective manners its cold medicinebr br detective manners repeatedly kicks a random guy in the face detective sloane what the hells going on manners what are you doing detective manners this maniac was rambling about demons and then he started smashing his head on the rock he just started smashing his head on the rock i think hes on pcp or somethingbr br lol
2,everyone should totally see this movie its freaking scary but doesnt resort to lame jumpoutatyoujusttosurpriseyouandpassitoffasscary things it really is great see this freaking awesome movie the director is stanley kubrick easily the greatest director who ever lived every single one of his movies are masterpieces including this one the shining is about this family that goes to a hotel in the colorado rockies as caretakers for the winters and get snowed in well the house is haunted the kid is psychic the husband is easily impacted by evil haunted hotels andwellhilarity ensues not really it becomes this gripping thriller where stuff gets thrown at the viewer from all different directions and it gets scary not just the classic heres johnny scene its memorable but cant speak for the whole movies its one of those things where words dont explain it adequately and you just gotta see it so go on netflix and get it geeeeeetttttttt itttttttt
4,i am normally skeptical about watching films or miniseries based on novels because the screenplay is always different from the novel fortunately i was wrong the screenplay was very close to the novel i guess it helps that the author was an executive producer and writer huhbr br the cast is outstanding i cant describe how much i enjoyed seeing such a wide range of actors from ossie davis and ruby dee to robert richard and bianca lawsonbr br the location setting i was expecting to see the homes and cottages i imagined in my mind what i saw on screen was slightly different however it wasnt enough to make me dislike the miniseriesbr br i recommend this for anyone who has read the novel you will not be disappointed if you have out of 10 starsbr br 
7,go see this movie for the gorgeous imagery of andy goldsworthys sculptures and treat yourself to a thoroughly eyeopening and relaxing experience the music perfectly complements the footage but never draws attention towards itself some commentators called the interview snippets with the artist a weak spot but consider this why would you expand on this in a movie if you can read andys musings at length in his books or attend one of his excellent lectures this medium is much more suitable to show the ephemeral nature of the artists works and is used expertly in this respect
7,this documentary explores a story covered in pilgers latest book freedom next time which was published in 2006 it reveals the shocking expulsion of the natives of diego garcia one of the chagos islands in the indian oceanbr br the islanders are technically british citizens as diego garcia is a british colony much like mauritius the nearby island to where the natives were exiled used to be but the british government has ignored their pleas to return to their homeland as the island is now a military base for the united states army who have used it as a basis for the bombing of iraq and afghanistanbr br as usual pilgers coverage is shocking especially as he documents the treatment and the current impoverished living conditions of the surviving islanders his interviews all round are excellent and his cornering of a parliament representative where he uses the governments own information to pin him down ranks as one of his bestbr br pilger also uses dramatic reconstruction to dissect a series of recently released documents that fully illuminate the british conspiracy to evict the natives the weaving of this footage with the interviews and the islanders music really heightens the films impactbr br it is not easy viewing but stealing a nation is john pilger at his best recommended
5,i wasnt born until years after this wonderful show first aired but luckily i managed to catch the reruns of the mid 90s and the rest is historyi was hooked the premise was pretty simple two hardened nemesis agents richard barrett and craig stirling  william gaunt and stuart damon are partnered up with an expert if not young doctor and biologist sharron macready to head behind the bamboo curtain to retrieve a dangerous biological agent from being used by red china whilst making their escape their plane is hit by machine gun fire and they crash in the heart of the himalayas where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilisation who heal and enhance the senses of the trio thus setting the scene for many exciting adventures to comebr br the series lasted for 30 hour long episodes and i guess it was its relatively short lived one season run that has set it up for cult statusbr br monty berman the producer was notorious for making things as cheaply as possible and sometimes the show suffered for this with incredibly tacky sets  particularly in episodes such as happening  a studio deputising for the australian outback and the snow sets of operation deep freeze and the beginning but if you can get past this and focus on the characters and the story lines the show was really a lot of fun it had a great mix of adventure and plenty of deadpan humour mainly from some terrific one liners from william gauntbr br the chemistry from the three leads was fantastic  you get the sense that they were really having a lot of fun making the show and this is borne out in the 2005 reunion documentary where the three reunite after over 35 years to reminisce about the show and laugh about anthony nicholls awful wig they all shared equal screen time and all had their moments to shine i have to say i was always a richard barrett fan  i loved his sardonic humour along with that dangerous edge  he was certainly a man you didnt cross and those eyesthe bluest eyes you would probably see on tv i have also followed bill gaunts career with interest since however craig stirling certainly would have had his legion of female fans and i am sure alexandra bastedo had a whole queue of male fans swooning over her toobr br the show also had a plethora of guest stars to entice with including donald sutherland jeremy brett peter wyngarde burt kwouk anton rodgers kate omara jenny linden paul eddington and colin blakelybr br notable episodes for me were  auto kill the interrogation the fanatics the mission and the gilded cage but i am sure every one has their personal favouritesbr br if you do get a chance to watch this show for the first time or to re watch it after many years remember to watch it in the context of the time it was made and just sit back and enjoy  the characters and the chemistry from the three leads is what made this wonderful show for me and i dont think i will ever tire of itbr br enjoy
3,this movie was craptacular i was so emotionally uninvolved in every single character that the movies biggest antagonist was in fact myself i played it beautifully throughout promising myself i would walk away but only drinking another beer hoping it would automagically transform into something engrossing along the way even in this state i couldnt help but notice that cubas acting was as flimsy as tracing paper his obsessive dedication to his job was unconvincingly done as well as his one night binge after the failure of his own idiot standards burt came on the screen as a general thats right a general who wears too much makeup i fell into a frighteningly fast binge to rival cubas except mine was real and i stubbed my toe recompense recompense my stubbed toe
1,in a year of pretentious muck like synecdoche new york a film born out of charlie kaufmans own selfindulgence comes a film that is similarly hard to watch but about three times as important frownland is a labor of love by the crew the actors and the filmmaker shot over years by friends it traces a man who cannot communicate through his thoroughly authentic real brooklyn world the people that you see are a step beyond even the stylization of the mumblecore movement they are real people painfully trapped in their own selfcontained neuroses unwilling to change unable the real world to them is their own set of delusions and because this is a film about people who are so profoundly out of touch it is very difficult to watch it is 16mm filmmaking without proper light money or any of the other factors that would make a film slick but its honesty can not be understated a fact that would cause a room full of people to dismiss it and for richard linklater to give it an award as he did at sxsw this does remind of films like naked or the best of the mumblecore it is a film that is not for everyone but one that challenges you to watch and grows on you the longer you think about it
6,i have wanted to see this for the longest time james merendino is a great director slc punk is one of my favorite movies and in the first ten minutes of this film i thought that it was a great follow up after that though it begins to drag the acting and direction were terrific in fact everything in the film seemed to flow except for the script at times the only thing keeping my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world claire forlani this film was good but i expected morebr br ps look for great cameos by chi mcbride and chris mcdonald
1,i havent seen this in over 20yrs but i still remember things about itbr br this film could not have been made in color the stark grays are what make it and was life really that simple in the 1950s what stands out the most in my memory is perry smith going to the gallows his breathing under the hood just before they sprung the trap i dont think i could watch that againonce is plenty its like that unnamed guy at the beginning of papillon who is dragged out in terror to the guillotine the guy that said watch this on a double bill with dead man walking should have added the last 10 minutes of i want to live as wellbr br some of my ancestors being aristos went to the guillotine in 179495 so my feelings on the death penalty are rather intense
0,this movie deserves credit for its original approach it combines elements of theater film and epic storytelling unfortunately it falls flat on all levels the films biggest weakness is its unwillingness to commit to anything it has camp moralistic and epic elements without ever committing to any of them as for the story itself chretien de troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable unbearably innocent percival into a most ungallant and rude churlbr br most likely two types of people will see this francophiles or arthuriophiles speaking as one of the latter i found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story
0,this movie is supposed to be a lighthearted tale about santa claus and his magical and mystical wonders but instead it comes off as being downright creepy two things in this movie that stand out in my mind as horrifying are the way santa looks have you ever seen a more horrible looking santa claus and the evil rep of satan pitchs just plain odd dances are just sickening to watch only watch this movie if it happens to be the msted version or if you like a very good laugh i cant believe this is a childrens movie
1,this movie has a slew of great adult stars but fails to get you interested in a way an adult film should among all the stars you couldnt get your kicks from any of the scenes the movie is shot in a dream like middle age set which is embarrassingly cheesy the acting is worse than keanu reeves the sex scenes are as exciting as listening to your neighbor talk about their kid in college and the dialogue is the worse i have seen in a movie the plot also was worse by ten fold id stick to the amateur route the audio commentary was useless since its a skin flick but even then that was bad too unless your a diehard jenna jameson fan there is little here 410
2,never viewed this film and enjoyed the singing and dancing by cagney and the other cast members namely dick powell scott blair who had a great tenor voice and ruby keeler bea thorn james cagney plays the role as chester kent who writes musicals and eventually goes into producing prologues which are shown in between the feature films shown in movie theaters during the 1930s chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows this is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs joan blondell nan prescott gave a great supporting role who was also very young and pretty dick powell was great as a singer and dancer and just starting out with his long and successful screen career enjoy

0,you need to watch this show once to have seen them all the formula is exactly the same in each episode jim does something his way he means well but he upsets his wife at the end she finds out that what he did was really for her she caresses his cheek and gives a gummy smile while he looks on bashfully in fact the story lines are so lame and formulaic that ill take a stab at one nowbr br episode valentines paybr br jims wife notices that all of jims weekly pay has disappeared he then explains to her he lost it at the casino she screams and leaves the house lamenting how awful he is then on valentines day he turns up in a limo with tickets to a ball hence explaining the missing wages she realizes her mistake and the usual oh jim youre so lovely the endbr br another very obvious item is the fact that jims character is based on homer simpson who as a cartoon character can get away with being belligerent and ignorant when this is attempted with human beings it does not work and jim just comes over as an arrogant self centered jerk br br imo the only reason that this is successful is simply because were so many now in terms of human beings with tvs these days you could make a show about a man who insulates walls and youd get an audiencebr br two and a half men on the other hand is fantastic and hilarious

7,this movie tells the tender tale of a demented scientist who after his fiance is decapitated goes around ogling strippers so that he can find a suitable body to attach her noggin to everyone in this movie exudes more slime than a snail particularly our protagonist
0,four great stories from master robert bloch adapted to the screen by the best actors in the field in the early seventies are the base of this excellent amicus production this was a kind of movie very popular in the sixties till the midseventies and its one of my favorite type of horror movies this one in particular shines for the episode sweets to the sweet where christopher lee is stalked by his evil little girl child heiress to her mother tradition great fun from start to finish and good to very good are also the other three episodes with the last one a bit on the comic side but with the great addition of ingrid pitt the most famous vampress of the english cinema
7,reading web sites on bette davis one can find instances where authors claim that there is nothing special about her acting i even found a site which claimed that bette davis success was probably due to her luck but ms davis films of 1934 tell quite the opposite the most evident example are two films that she did only few weeks apart fog over frisco and on human bondage characters she played in these movies though both being negative are quite different arlene in the former is a beautiful glamorous and frivolous heiress and much more likable character than mildred in the latter which is a pale uneducated and impudent cockney waitress needless to say that ms davis played both characters very authentic and with the same enthusiasm but even that is not all the point is that the former role which would be wished by most actresses of the day was the one she was forced to play the latter role which seemed to most actresses as undesirable career destroying role was the one she fought for ferociously for months and it was the latter role that launched her among the greatest stars so there is no question that ms davis knew from the start what she was doingbr br the film which tells about a medical student phillip carey leslie howard which falls unhappily in love with cockney waitress mildred rogers bette davis has a few week points but many more strong ones the story is simply too big to be told in mere 83 minutes for example it is quite unclear why refined student found any interest in an impudent waitress in the first place well there is one scene in which we are exposed to ms davis captivating eyes but this is when his emotions are already fully evolved nevertheless the integrity of the story is preserved by superior acting from howard and davis as well as fantastic steiners music which tells tons of emotions even when we do not see characters faces in fact the film is amalgamated by phillips walking sequences showing him from the back supplemented with shuddering twotone repetition every detail is well thought  max steiner wrote a beautiful leitmotif for each women in phillips life which is consistently used through the film and a beautiful scene in which we see sallys face in front of calendar is one of the sweetest scenes ive ever seen exactly due to francis dees breathtaking beauty ms dee was by the way considered to be too beautiful to play leading role in gone with a wind as well as steiners captivating music camera movements between the some scenes is also original and refreshingbr br but my strongest objection is that events are presented too twodimensionally which induce viewer that mildred is an ultimate slut the most disgusting characters ought to be men which lure her into relationship despite well knowing that they will abandon her after taking use of her but they curiously finished portrayed as likable characters after all mildred always  in her own specific but still a honest way  lets phillip know that she despises him and had no interest in him which he just refuses to hear it is phillips masochistic nature connected to his club foot and infantile experiences that is the principal reason of his love problem he is enslaved to his club foot as much as to mildred and perhaps has to be free of both to start a normal life of course selfish and impudent mildred after discovering voluntary phillips bondage to her did its own share to make his life hell even taking into account that she exploded after realizing that the bondage has loosen it is less than clear why would she burn phillips money maugham intended different in his novel after all she could as well steal it and drunk gallons of champagnebr br for modern standards the film is a bit outdated but each subsequent time you watch it you can reveal new interesting details due to superior acting fascinating music and original editing so it does deserve the highest possible mark
6,i was very disappointed in this 1970 film based on a bernard malamud story this is basically a story of possible redemption racial bias and the unfulfillment of life based on mistrustbr br a black jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife if morris mishkin zero mostel will only believe in the angel belafonte his wife fanny ida kaminska will recover the problem is that morris has basically given up on life and just refuses to believe that belafonte is an angelbr br when he believes it fanny improves but in the end he has doubts and fanny suffers accordingly it would have been very nice if there had been an english translation in the last scene when a dying fanny speaks to morrisbr br jan kadar who successfully directed miss kaminska in her oscar nominated brilliant performance in 1966s the shop on main street directs this film as well kaminska is reduced in the film to mostly bed scenes and her kindness in her speech really doesnt convey the desperate situation that she faces she keeps calling for ruthie their daughter who disobeyed them by marrying out of the jewish religion for most of the film she does not realize the angels appearance in her apartmentbr br the scene in the pharmacy is muddled and the scene where the angels girl friend confronts belafonte in their apartment is memorable but all too briefbr br we dont know why belafonte is in danger and why he has diedbr br those viewing this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and desperation
1,i had a lot of hopes for this movie and so watched it with a lot of expectations basically because of kamal hassan he is an amazing actor who has marked his foot steps in the sands of time forever but this movie proved to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen after watching this the movie the brutality and violence in tenebra and clockwork orange looks far better br br the protagonist raghavan is a very daring police officer who is assigned to a investigate brutal serial murders raghavan efficiently finds the connecting thread in this case and is close to solve the murders and put the psycho killers two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students behind bars but they escape and again get into a killing spree finally raghavan kills them both after sparing many innocent livesbr br these two psychokillers are the ones who are going to keep the audiences from going to the theaters the murders and sexual harassments and rapes are shown very explicitly which the movie could have survived without br br to even imagine that teenagers and kids are going to be watching this movie in the theater and kind of picture it is bound to paint in their minds are certainly not pretty the director gautham should realize that he also has some obligation to the society and his audiencecertainly i am never going to the movies looking like gauthams name on the production list
5,although not one of vonneguts better known works it is a definite mustsee interestingly thought out i especially like how the director filmed the couple in love
3,this film is horribly acted written directed and produced but its so campy its actually semiwatchable thats semi watchablebr br the storyline what little there is makes virtually no sense whatsoever the barney drum character is the only real comic relief in the movie and that gets tired after about 30 seconds br br many of the canadian supporting cast can be found in tv commercials none of them went on to anything else that im aware of and of course sly stallones even less talented brother well br br trivia it was filmed almost entirely in and around the little village of claremont ont about 20 miles neast of toronto i recognized many local landmarksintersectionsbuildings i think the drivein scene was filmed at the now demolished oshawa drivein just before it was torn down
1,when you look back at another bad nightmare sequel like freddys revenge you have to at least give it some credit for trying something new and although the dream child is more enjoyable it offers absolutely nothing new to the series yes theres the creative deaths as usual like a kid becoming part of a comic book and facing super freddy but even scenes like that arent used to their full potential and the parts without freddy are just boringbr br this marked the official death of scariness to the series freddy seems to be the comedic relief nowbut to whatbr br my rating 410
0,this is not a film you can really analyse separately from its production the audience became the filmmakers to an extent unprecedented in the history of the american film industry we felt so involved that viewing it becomes like watching the work of a friend how is it possible to be objective this is our movie isnt it or is it there may be nothing more disingenuous than a filmmaker who promotes himself as the audiences friend giving them all the naughty treats that the nannyish critics would deny them just look at that prime selfpublicist eli roth promising gorehounds all the viscera missing from literally gutless mainstream horror films only to churn out a watered down and technically incompetent piece of work like hostelbr br david r ellis may not have spawned the monster that was the internet response to his film but he was quite understandably quick to engage with it he took the carnivalhuckster school of filmmaking to a new level getting the fans to build what they would eventually buy so many have enthused over this interactive democratic approach to filmmaking that they seem to have missed the point  that this is the most cynical form of filmasmarketing nothing is included that the filmmakers know the fans wont buy and any old suggestion that will get bums on seats is incorporated the fact that the pitch became the title tells you all you need to knowbr br isnt this just the evolution of the focus group approach individual creativity talent craft ideas all are sacrificed before the inane chatter of the masses its a critical commonplace that focus groups and test screenings dont make for good movies  why should the preemptive intervention of internet enthusiasts be any different because we happen to be film fans well thank god for us because otherwise i might not have seen a topless woman get her nipple bitten by a snakebr br so yes i had fun at the movie  a midnight showing fresh from the pub and with a bucket of icecream  but it actually had relatively little to do with the film and quite a lot to do with the atmosphere like christmas everyone seemed determined that they would have fun no matter what there was laughter but i dont know if it was with the film or at the film with a film as calculated as this one is that even a meaningful distinction there are some genuinely good aspects to the film samuel l jackson gives a welljudged performance pure selfparody but with a real sense of pleasure rachel blanchard and lin shaye are decent in limited roles and there are one or two inspired moments  the fate of the lap dog is genuinely funny black comedy that the rest of the film fails to emulatebr br the stock characters are to be expected but the total lack of suspense isnt whats the point of a film that combines two great phobias if theres no creeping menace there are several snakejumpsout moments but theyre incredibly badly staged only the annoying british man gets a decent pulpy death scene  the other killings are oddly flat the demise of the honeymoon couple for instance is shamefully botched most of the actors fail to make an impression its a shame that a charismatic actress like julianna margulies should seem so tired when she tells two kids to close their eyes and pretend the turbulent flight is a rollercoaster she could be talking to the audience  the film falls far shortbr br there are worse movies but there are many many better another reviewer on this site compared this film with lake placid and its as apt a contrast as any i can think of that film worked so magnificently because the performances were excellent the jokes were funny the suspense sequences were scary and it wasnt devised by committee that the characters had a little depth and shading was an unexpected bonus i dont need a postpub midnight showing to have a good time with that filmbr br this film will in time fade to become a mere footnote in film history if it sets a precedent however im genuinely worried about what might be crossing our screens in a couple of years time in all probability nothing much will come of it perennial popcorn favourites  raiders of the lost ark alien halloween and of course star wars  just arent produced by groupthinkbr br in the mean time ill tell you what  i havent half got a craving for some ingmar bergman
2,as i have matured my fascination with the academy awards has evolved from intense interest to casual amusement as in a few other comments that i have written the bizarre results of academy award voting are often difficult to explain the omission of in cold blood in 1967 as one of the five best picture nominees is one of those inexplicable instances especially when one of the nominations that year went to the wretched and unwatchable dr dolittle while only an insomniac or masochist would tune in to that rex harrison disaster richard brooks powerful adaptation of truman capotes nonfiction novel retains its ability to capture the viewers attention and leave him or her completely drained by the final fade out while there is nothing particularly graphic or gruesome on screen the film is definitely adult material based on a nebraska multiple murder in the 1950s and filmed in the actual locations where the murders took place in cold blood was filmed by master cinematographer conrad hall in stark black and white and his screen compositions demand to be seen in their correct widescreen aspect ratio together with quincy joness unsettling score halls work should have been credited above the title with brooks screenplay as the three pillars on which this intense classic is built the performances are fine as well scott wilson is all cold charm and robert blake intense introversion as the two killers there is an inside joke at one point when blake speaks of bogart and the treasure of the sierra madre while the duo are driving to mexico as a child star blake sold the lottery ticket to bogart in that john huston film the film like the book is definitely slanted towards the killers and has an anticapital punishment tilt although the remorselessness of the murderers somewhat negates that sentiment despite the difficulttowatch final scenes some have criticized the film because it does focus on the criminals their backgrounds and lives while the clutter family which was literally murdered in cold blood in the middle of the night come across as onedimensional characters of little import this lack of balance comes from the book as capote spent much time with the two killers while they were on death row the clutter family was apparently not researched to the same depth however whatever feelings one may have for or against capital punishment in cold blood will leave you mired deep in conflicting thoughts run a double bill with dead man walking and you may not speak for days
0,oh dear this movie could have been subtitled when writers go on strike what a stinker i had really high hopes for this mostly after reading imdb reviews which makes me wonder about the whole imdb rating system but thats a separate matter i loved steve carrell in anchorman bruce almighty the office etc so i was expecting great things to say i was disappointed is the understatement of the year there are so many things wrong with this movie but ill confine myself to a the implausibility of any family behaving like these people do a mass aerobics workout what planet is that real life on the clunky script a murderer of love please and the fact that the character of dan is so unlikable you find yourself wondering what the girl saw in him to make her fall in love with him this movie was filled to bursting with clunky dialogue creaking direction ridiculous setscenes and it was slow slow slow we would have walked out after half an hour if wed not been with my parents who dont get out much and dont like to waste money unlike the makers of this movie who would have been better off throwing all the cash spent making this movie into a bonfire  that would have been more entertaining if you like movies avoid this like the plague
3,there is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or a producer actress nichole hiltz she is the show in this slow moving and wildly unlikely story of revenge directed by simon gornick the film stars joyce hyser as a betrayed wife who decides to seek revenge on her cheatin spouse oh but not by conventional means she plans a total guerrilla war and recruits bad girl nichole hiltz as her weapon of choice she wants nichole as tuesday to get close to her ex the handsome but dull stephan jenkins who should stick to music to embarrass him and ruin his life david deluise is good in his few brief moments and former crime story star anthony dennison is given virtually nothing to do but scowl hiltz on the other hand comes off at various times as sexy and playful then evil and devious she also handles vulnerable and maybe a bit psychotic well shes also quite hot though theres no naughty bits show so you can understand how she might be able to get to any guy she is aimed at but the performance is kind of wasted in this movie which is just not edgy or interesting enough to recommend
6,minor spoilers br br i am like many others a huge jerry bruckheimer fan so when i saw all the beautiful posters hanging out front and the trailer coming by before mi2 expectations were rising a jerry bruckheimer production big cars nic cage and fresh from an oscar angelina jolie what can possibly go wrong a lot br br the script is neither funny which it tries really hard to be nor exciting you put in a black person who is constantly making racist jokes about himself and woohhaa youve got comedy i dont think so excitement is totally out of the picture first of all and this is probably said many times there are no sympathetic characters so who cares who gets killed if you can stomach the premise that a psycho is gonna kill nics brother unless he steals 50 cars in days next thing you know is that kip the brother is walking with nic in the streets again is this excitement think not then comes the best bit the romance between nic and angelina she actually looks bored having to utter all these stupid lines to nic do you have a girlfriend are you seeing anybody what went wrong etcbr br then theres only one sparkle of hope left the car chases theyre disappointing to say the least because the trailer made it look like it was full of them and theres only one a very long one caught in irritatingly hectic camera movement i really had trouble following the actionbr br so is it an action movie a thriller a romantic comedy  theres no need to decide just avoid this horrible mess ill give out of 10 stars and i feel like im being generous
7,words cant describe how utterly stupid this story and therefore bad this movie is basinger del toro  what were you thinking  so theres a mall and its parking space is totally full basingers character goes in to buy a cup of tea and some packaging paperbr br when she comes out the whole place is so empty that nobody hears two gunshots fired nearby  even though she lives there when she drives away from the baddies she goes to the most remote and godforsaken place possible instead of the nearest police station or at least a crowded place  come on  i wont even go into the infamous red toolbox since other people have done that before let alone how she kills the moronic thugs one by onebr br this is so stupid without the least bit of logic i can only warn you watching it its a total waste of time honestly 
7,my fondness for chris rock varies with his moviesi hated him after lethal weapon 4but i hated everyone in that movie after iti like him when he is himself and not holding backlike in dogma well this is his best yetwasnt expecting this to be that goodlaughed my arse off the whole time chris rock delivers a sweet wonderful story backed by some of the funniest comedy ive seen in quite some time loved it
3,this movie is like real life by which i mean  not a lot happens in the available hours or so and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast their invisibility being due to the experimental lighting as mentioned by many reviewers br br a big bore no big surprise that altman helms this  he is a very variable performer yes we all loved gosford park but pret a porter anyone kansas city dr t and the women aaargh but the fact that the raw material is a john grisham tale and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber  makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film and no it is not so bad its goodbr br its just bad
1,one may ask why the characters snarl yell and chew the scenery without any perceptible reason except someone wanted to make a movie in barcelona billie baldwin is that the right one is forgettable in the copestrangedhusbandlovingfatherofcutelittleblondgirl role the story seems to have been cut and pasted from the scenes thrown away from adventure films in the last three years ellen pompeos lack of charisma is a black hole that seems to suck the energy out of every scene she is in her true acting range is displayed when she takes her blouse off as the movies careens from one limp chase scene to another unfortunately the directing rarely goes bad enough to be camp or a parody it is all just clich familiar in every respect the director cast his own daughter as the precocious brat probably because no respectable agent would have permitted a client to ruin a career by being in such a lame contrived and uninteresting movie the only heist here is the theft of the investors money and the viewers time
6,dark angel rocks the best show i have seen in ages damn those people who took it off me and my friends have gatherings to watch every da episode takes like days but it is worth it it finished before it finished what it wanted to say and that annoys the hell out of me
2,a movie has rarely left me as cold as this one there is not a bit of tension not a second of fear not a moment we jump even a little bit the girl is cute yeah thats it was that worth a movie  i knew it wasnt supposed to be a great movie but i was at least expecting one
4,i was interested to see the move thinking that it might be a diamond in the rough but the only thing i found was bad writing horrible directing the shot sequences do not flow even though the director might say that that is what he is going for it looks very uninspired and immature the editing could have been done by anyone with vcrs and the stock was low budget video i would say that it wasnt even something as simple as mini digital video br br there are some simple ways to fix a film with what the director has like through editing etc but it is obvious that he just doesnt care there is as much effort put in to this movie as a ham sandwich it could be made better but that would mean extra work
1,rko studios decided to borrow both william powell from mgm and jean arthur from columbia for one of their more big budget efforts to cash in on the popularity of the thin man they succeeded to some degreebr br a lot of folks forget that in addition to and earlier than nick charles bill powell also played in a few philo vance films in the title role so by this time he was pretty well set in the role doctor bradford is not doing as many liquid lunches as nick charles but the basic blas nick is still there one difference is that while nick charles married an heiress doctor bradford works for a living as a physician that helps in his avocation of detective and in fact it does in this filmbr br hes got two murders to solve a jockey falls off a horse coming into the homestretch of a big race and dies for no apparent reason the trainer suspects something afoot but hes bumped off by the more conventional method of a bullet this is after he comes to bill powell for helpbr br myrna loy was a more steadying influence on bill powell than jean arthur was arthur plays it as more of a dizzy dame than loy did but it works here and she and powell have good chemistrybr br the ever dependable james gleason is the police inspector in the sam levenenat pendleton role all they needed here was asta and possibly eric blore as powells butler was essaying that partbr br if powell and arthur were signed at this studio we might have seen a whole slew of bradford films
7,where to startoh yea message to the bad guys when you first find the person you have been tracking in order to kill that witnessed a crime you committed dont spend time talking to her so that she has yet another opportunity to get away message to the victim when the thugs are talking amongst themselves and arguing take that opportunity to run away dont sit there and watch them until you make a noise they hear message to the director if someone has a or 10 minute head start in a vehicle or on foot you cant have the bad guys on their heels or bumper right away time and motion doesnt work that way it would also be nice to think that a woman doesnt have to brutally kill men in order to empower herself to leave an abusive relationship at home
7,i wasnt sure whether to laugh or cry porretta was good looking but resembled like a mexican porn star not an english outlaw costumes what costumes a tshirt with strips of black leather on it it was marions clothesor lack of themthat really got me do the fans of this stinker really believe women dressed like that in medieval england the mongols and vikings were inaccurate and stupid but the episode with an alien was worst of all especially as his make up mainly consisted of oatmeal on his facean old trickthe hedgehog monster was pretty funny as was climbing up the side of a castle on a ladder of arrowsas if the us accents grated as did the initial drawling voice over rawbin hood and liddle johnthe second robin and marion were really quite minging in looks and what was left of the show went totally down the pan
0,i agree with another user here and have to say that this is one of the best kung fu movies ever i watched this as a kid and absolutely loved it the scaffolding scenes are brilliant and you can really empathise with this guy because he is treated as an outcast nice humour and fantastic kung fu this movie rocks if you like kung fu you would love this
4,what can you possibly say about a show of this magnitude the sopranos has literally redefined television as we know it it has broken all rules and set new standards for television excellence everything is flawless the writing directing and for me most of all the acting watching this show youll find yourself realizing that these characters are not real the acting tricks you into thinking there is a real tony soprano or any character this show is also very versatile some people dont watch the show because its violent its not all about the violence its about business family and many deeper things that all depend on what you as a fan see for me i dont like when people refer to the show a show about the mafia for me its a show about family a family who through generations happen to be apart of the mob overall this is a masterpiece of a show this is what television should be right here complex characters from stunning acting magnificent story lines from brilliant writing and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together a show that defines excellence and dares to be different
5,i have this film out of the library right now and i havent finished watching it it is so bad i am in disbelief audrey hepburn had totally lost her talent by then although shed pretty much finished with it in robin and marian this is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film its really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the dorothy stratten appearance just prior to her homicidebr br there is nothing but idiocy between gazzara and his cronies little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest palest shadowbr br who could believe that there are even some of the same manhattan environs that hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in breakfast at tiffanys twenty years earlier the soundtrack of old sinatra songs and the gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obviousyou sure dont have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cinemusique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at youbr br reverting to type means going back up as well as going back down i guess in this case audrey hepburns chic european lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star here she has even lost her talent as a star if someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period like annmargret had played the role there would have been some life in it even given the unbelievably bad material and mongoloidlevel situationsbr br hepburn was a great person of course greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors after this dreadful performance she went on to make an atrocious tv movie with robert wagner called love among thieves in they all laughed it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50s even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like lana turner were infinitely more effective than is hepburn turner took acting seriously even when she was bad hepburn doesnt take it seriously at all couldnt be bothered with it even her hair and clothes look tacky her last really good work was in two for the road perhaps her most perfect if possibly not her best in many waysbr br and that girl who plays the country singer is just sickening john ritter is horrible there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see dorothy stratten who was truly pretty otherwise critic david thomsons oftused phrase losing hisher talent never has made more sensebr br ben gazarra had lost all sex appeal by then and so we have films with gazarra and hepburnwho could ask for anything less sandra dees last pitiful film lost from years later a lowbudget nothing had more to it than this at least ms dee spoke in her own voice by 1981 audrey hepburns accent just sounded silly shed go on to do the pbs gardens of the world with audrey hepburn and there her somewhat irritating accent works as she walks through english gardens with aristocrats or waxes effusively about what i like most is when flowers go back to nature as in naturalized daffodils but in an actual fictional movie she just sounds ridiculousbr br to think that breakfast at tiffanys was such a profound sort of light poetic thing with audrey hepburn one of the most beautiful women in the worldshe was surely one of the most beautiful screen presences in my fair lady matching garbo in several things and delphine seyrig in last year at marienbad and then this and her final brief role as the angel hap in the spielberg film always was just more of the lady stuffcorny witless and stiflingbr br i went to her memorial service at the fifth avenue presbyterian church a beautiful service which included a boys choir singing the shaker hymn simple gifts the only thing not listed in the program was the sudden playing of hepburns singing moon river on the fire escape in breakfast at tiffanys and this brought much emotion and some real tears out in the congregationbr br a great lady who was once a fine actress as in the nuns story and one of the greatest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of the 50s and 60s who became a truly bad onethats not all that common and perhaps it is only a great human being who in making such things as film performances trivial nevertheless has the largeness of mind to want to have the flaws pointed out mercilesslywhich all of her late film work contained in abundance most of the talk about hepburns miscasting is about my fair lady but the one that should have had the original actress in it was wait until dark which had starred lee remick on broadway never as celebrated as hepburn she was a better actress in many ways hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid although hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part after that all of her acting went downhill
4,ossessionebr br luchino viscontis debut film this italian noir is generally credited with launching the neorealist movementwell it says so right on the back of the boxand is a sometimes penetrating sometimes lugubrious portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux set in fascist italy an assortment of supporting charactersincluding an ingenuous drifter who espouses communist virtuesembody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without drifting phantasms longing for a soul although viscontis compassion for the disenfranchised and his ability to express their lamentable conditions was already welldeveloped the spider web of deceit is tenuousalthough a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve itthe cosmic irony too didactic the illicit relationship strained with bathos all the same its incisive and essential although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable
0,bromwell high is a cartoon comedy it ran at the same time as some other programs about school life such as teachers my 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that bromwell highs satire is much closer to reality than is teachers the scramble to survive financially the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers pomp the pettiness of the whole situation all remind me of the schools i knew and their students when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school i immediately recalled  at  high a classic line inspector im here to sack one of your teachers student welcome to bromwell high i expect that many adults of my age think that bromwell high is far fetched what a pity that it isnt
5,scott menville is not casey kasem that is the first most important and most disturbing thing about this attempt at reimagining scoobydoo and companybr br shaggys voice is squeaky and does not sound anything like he has ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the scooby shows theyve also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the originalbr br im not sure what theyre on about yet with the villain angle but it surely isnt following the formula used in any of the previous scooby showsbr br and the animation style is very bizarre and distorted i like it but its not real scoobydoo type animation but the weird animation used for other wb shows grew on me this might toobr br its worth a glance at  once  if you can handle the lack of proper shaggy voice that right there is enough to jar one out of enjoying the show properly besides i am trying not to be an inflexible nitpicking fan evolve or die as the saying goes well see how it looks after two more episodes  by then ill have formed a much more solid opinion
2,whipped is one of the most awful films of all time it is a mean hateful piece of garbage that had me forcing myself to stay in the theater more than any other movie of 2000 besides maybe the grinch it is not as people have called it an insightful portrait of modern relationships that would be a little film called high fidelity whereas that movie was honest and sympathetic whipped is hostile cynical misanthropic cinematic poison avoid this like so many plagues unless you want to see how truly bad a comedy can get
0,this is what you would get if you allowed a 10 year old manic american to write a story of a moon trip absolute garbage with no redeeming qualities maybe it held some fascination in the 3d dept but as a narrative and entertaining animation it held nothing to make wasting an hour and a half worth while save your time and money and watch bolt insteadbr br damn not enough lines yet i feel that sums it up well i agree with an above review  this is like a coldwar propaganda story maybe it would have been more interesting if they had made it about the flies uncovering the hoax of the moon landing or if the flies had died in the first minute btw  why were all the main character flies deformed  not one had the full compliment of limbs
0,it was 930 pm last night at my friends camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch south park a new episode the thing is in my country south park airs at 1030 pm and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing father of the pride ill start by saying that i have only watched to episodes the first time i watched it i found it unfunny and crude for nothing so i thought holy sht i have a football game early tomorrow so i have to stop watching stupid cartoons but yesterday i tried to give father of the pride a second chance i find that its a complete ripoff of the simpsons only replacing yellow human characters by lions insteadbr br the second thing is i wonder why it got its tv14 rating i find the simpsons a lot more vulgar and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual unfunny jokes the simpsons is also a lot more violent halloween specials and crude i also heard that the creator of the series has also directed shrek well ive got news for him shrek was way better and i think he stayed too much in the family thematic however i must admit that father of the pride did make me smile even burst out laughing once three or four timesbr br all in all i dont mind father of the pride i dont hate it but i dont like either ive seen way better from the simpsonsbr br 3510
0,i remember watching this movie with my friends when we were years old but the weird thing is that i never watched it after that the other day i was babysitting and my cousin never saw all dogs go to heaven so we rented both movies and watched them together today and he really loved these movies so many memories came back watching this movie once again and i have to admit i even cried a little im 22 years old and the ending still gets to me all dogs go to heaven is one of the most touching animated films and im shocked honestly by this rating of 58 i thought this movie would bring back good memories for others as well i admit the animation was a bit typical but the story is just so charming and funbr br charlie is a gambling dog who gets killed by another gambling dog carface but when charlie wants revenge he comes back to earth with a watch that cant stop ticking or thats the end of his life again when he and his best friend itchy look for carface and spy on him they find out how carface gets all his money he has a little orphan girl who talks to animals and finds out who is going to win the races charlie takes the girl annmarie and makes fake promises in order to get the money but he ends up learning that maybe he should put annmarie first before himself when carface goes back to him with a vengeancebr br all dogs go to heaven is the perfect family film its not disney but this is an excellent family film to watch not to mention that its just so cute and touching i know its ridicules and some people call me crazy but this movie for me when i was a kid made me believe that dogs have souls how could they not theyre just so loving and i think im going to cry again but anyways i would just recommend this movie for anyone its a fun movie to watchbr br 710
6,the unborn is a pretty good lowbudget horror movie exploiting the fears associated with pregnancy its very well acted by the alwaysgood brooke adams and bmovie stalwart james karen although the supporting cast is pretty average for a bgrader the music by gary numan of all people is good too henry dominics script is quite intelligent for this sort of thing although there is a hint of misogyny about it rodman fenders direction is merely adequate and there are some unnecessary cheap scares if youre a fan of adams whose movie career is nowhere near as illustrious as it should be check it out shes great as always
5,for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time no exceptions james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller through films such as aliens the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and sciencefiction goes he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film but titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful interesting and entertaining film about it the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters arent given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose gloria stuart tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is roses and jacks story alone no one else emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home the music has become iconic and legendary it is composer james horners finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is only one problem the usual james cameron problem is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime my heart wont go on from this one
0,i was very excited when this series premiered in 2005 the premise was very simple and appealing each episode would be a onehour mini movie directed by a famous noteworthy horror director then when i finally watched them it was a bit of a letdown some good episodes emerged from that first season but all in all it was a mixed bag i attributed it to the learning curve and figured that season would be a whole lot betterbr br boy was i in for a shock at least season one had a few good stories here and there season with the exception of the black cat starring the excellent jeffrey combs was a complete and total loss to me the episode sounds like may very well be the worst thing i have watched on tv in the last 10 years and most of the other episodes arent much better i really hope that season turns this around next year but im not holding my breath
1,this film is just another distortion among many distortions on the socalled sins of consumerism please note that reverend billy an actor bill talen is nothing more than a bureaucrat against the sins of consumerism we might want to ask are questions like what does reverend billy do for a living how does he make his money does he make his living off his taxdeductible organization how does the internal revenue justify this as a taxdeductible church or organization br br everyone knows that christmas is commercialized but it affords one day out of a whole year in which people have an opportunity to be charitable and allows a significant number of people to spend time with their families friends or extended families everyone is not charitable everyone does not spend time with their families friends or extended families but holidays and vacation time give people that chance and opportunity yes america does have more than its share of problemsbut with perseverance americans have and always make it through great difficulties and even in times of strife america has proved itself to be the greatest country in the world that happens when americans pull together and unite rather than to separate and divide yes there are problems with corporations and monopolies but it will take americans to bring back the small businesses along with the ethics to responsibly care for people living in our individual communities yes globalization has brought us its share of problems but it will take americans to bring production back to america americans and the us government need to learn how to stay on a budget no matter how large or small it may be and we must stop our dependence on credit our overreliance on credit will make and keep us poor from the cradle to the grave it is important to buybut if we buy less we will rely less on credit and if we are able to save even a small amount of money we will have money for a rainy day not to say that as americans we will gain an equal share of wealth wealth is not guaranteed and has never been guaranteed but stratification teaches us that only a small percentage of americans hold most of americas wealth there is a good proximity that you or i can reach the level of the upper middle class and who knows what can happen from there be positive work hardand at the very least you and i will be able to reach at least some if not all of our dreams in life nothing is guaranteed but we always have that something to reach for and if you or i dont have dreams we might as well be dead in america there is always room for plenty of hopes and dreams as individuals we are a part of the pack but we always can become the leader of the packbr br it has always been my experience that churches and religion do offer nothing more than additional distortions but i pay dignity and give respect to people with other beliefs values and perspectives but as far as the distortions expressed within this film i do not have any faith in such beliefs values and perspectives i rank this film with a out of 10but in all honesty and truth this film deserves a zero this film has no integrity and i cannot recommend it
0,creep is a straight up serious horror film set in real time that wants nothing more than to just show people get attacked in a empty subway platform by a mutant for 85 minutes and it does just that nothing more nothing less director christopher smith draws out the drama a far as he plausibly can by introducing a series of characters that would actually have a reason to be in the subway after it is locked he also leaves the origins of the titular creep deliberately vague unlawful experiments happening in the 60s underground are hinted at and that little bit of mystery works for the most part sadly he undermines himself toward the end by actually holding back from a twist ending where more genetic malformations would appear they are hinted at as well yes you heard me right  i wanted a clichd twist ending franka run lola run potente is good as the terrorized female lead and the rest of the cast is fine
1,somebody called howard koch a schlockmeister but he did write the screenplay for casablanca didnt he or didnt he maybe theres more than one koch slinking around in hollywood and im not too fond of casablanca anyway wait a minute  yes there is another howard koch slinking around hollwyood thats the one who wrote casablanca no matter ill put as much care into this comment as howard w koch put into this production which is to say only a littlebr br you know what this sounds like somebody read cliffs notes on shakespeares king lear and decided since no original thoughts were aboard the inbound inspiration express to update it and hollywoodize it with a happy endingbr br there are differences lear decides to divvy up his vast estates between three sisters and before doing so asks them how much they love him two of the sisters throw themselves at his feet and brown nose him to get at his money the third is the good girl and refuses to go operatic on lear but in the play lear remains alive to regret his decision to give the two connivers his stash and deprive the honest girl he winds up crazy and naked during a gale on the moors putting flowers in his hair and hallucinating kids can do that to you take my kid for instance after all the effort i squandered on raising him does he show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer no in the end everybody in the play diesbr br in the movie evidently the good sister is morose and suicidal but when she tries to off herself somebody jumps in and saves her so the ending is more or less happy thats the difference between hollywood and a genuine tragedy unless you define hollywood as a tragedy sufficient unto itself
6,wow what can i say i like shity movies and i go out of my way to watch a corny action flick but snake eater i would have rather had a nail driven into my pee hole while my grandma gave me a lap dance lorenzo lamas pfft more like lorenzo lameass this guy has as much acting ability as bill clinton has self control it has all the goods to make a really bad movie even worse crazed hillbilles yep needless tit shot with a real weird scar yep crappy soundtrack yep i wish i could give the movie 10 stars but is as low as it goes seriously i think someone was playing a joke on me when i saw this it cant be real the worse thing there is 2more snake eater movies guess its in demand
6,misfits at a military school hmmmm sounds funny maybe offensive to some you have the characters there the arab thief the sex crazy teen the smart mouth the pot smoker and not to forget the guy who burns things throw in a strict no nonsense sergent a homosexual sergent and one sexy ammunition teacher and it makes one crazy film adventurebr br i have seen this film and it is funny because the comedy is revolved around the fact that if you try to work together things get donebr br these band of misfit students at weinberg military school have been placed in here because as sgt liceman quotes because you are outcasts embarrassments to your families and communities disgraces one of ralph macchios earlier performances before the karate kid and my cousin vinny with appearances from barbara bach as well this film appeals to teens and young adultsbr br great soundtrack keeps the film moving
0,i havent yet read the kurt vonnegut book this was adapted from but i am familiar with some of his other work and was interested to see how it would be translated to the screen overall i think this is a very successful adaptation of one of vonneguts novels it concerns the story of an american living in germany who is recruited as a spy for the us his job is to ingratiate himself with high ranked nazis and send secret messages to the americans via his weekly radio show but when the war ends he is denounced as a war criminal but escapes to new york where various odd plot twists awaitbr br if mother night has a problem its that it tends to get a little too sentimental at times but for most of the film the schmaltz is kept to a minimum and the very strange plot is carried through with skill and aplomb and there are some fabulous moments of black comedy involving three right wing christian fundamentalists and a very highly ranked nazi in a prison cell very much recommended
5,arrrrrggghhhhhh some people take life far too seriously watch this film for what it is sit back relax and have a giggle the film does not take itself seriously so neither should we if you like james belushi you will like this film if he is not your cup of tea  give it a missbr br i like james belushi so i liked this film so simple isnt it 
5,warning review contains slight spoilersbr br theres a parallel universe out there where gone in 60 seconds is a dark edgy controversial independent movie unfortunately in this dimension gone is a flashy vacuous testosteronefuelled moronfest starring nicolas cagebr br for reasons not really worth getting into he and his large number of cronies have four days to steal fifty expensive cars only one of which has an alarm this crew consists of the guy with the funnyshaped ears whos rumoured to be the new superman a guy who conducted electricity in the xfiles an exprofessional footballer and two token black menbr br their enemies are cops rival car thieves and bilborough from cracker his manchester accent suitably flattened and broadened for american audiences who are now used to that sort of thing since daphne in frasier theres also angelina jolie who gets no character save to be a receptacle to mens sexual desires she and cage are supposed to be old flames which is odd as they never have anything approaching a normal conversation in all of the films overlong 135m running timebr br in fact characterisation is so poor that whenever anyone has a moment a violin plays in the background to accentuate the emotion its no spoiler to reveal that vinnie jones who recreates his famous paul gasgoine hand ball manoeuvre and is quite menacing when silent only gets one line not because his inability to speak is integral to the plot but because his eloquent summing up of the films dubious morality after appearing mute the whole way through is funny allegedly after he struggles through it in his notquiteactingbutitlldo london drawl cage quips i always thought you were from long island my ribs as you might imagine were well and truly tickledbr br in fact humour is the most undeveloped aspect from the tactless comedy policeman to the two token black characters this sees the biggest aspect of hollywood take hold why is it that a black man cannot appear in a major motion picture without being constantly aware of his skin tone and endlessly refer to it the younger man who like the elder jivetalks for the whole duration proclaims us black people dont like the cold  were tropical people he then goes on to express an urge to smoke a joint and watch roots he is of course parodying the image of black people but how funny is that his older counterpart cannot speak without referring to himself and thereby his colour in third person my black ass this my black ass that does anyone know any black people who actually speak like that thought notbr br the films soundtrack is played almost nonstop and with increasing volume some of the tracks  especially apollo 440s dont stop the rock  so loud theyre actually more audible than the sound effects and dialogue the surroundsound system even separates the two to such a degree that it makes them sound like two different films running together no background music concept here its the aural equivalent of trying to watch a film while someone at the back of the cinema has their stereo turned up full blast keep that music down young manbr br this isnt the worst film in the world and in many ways i enjoyed it its just that its predictable lazy and witless with minimal effort in its construction apparently box office expectations are considerably down for this movie after being forcefed junk for several years it appears the general public are starting to wake up to the fact
0,ive heard nothing but great things about the 2006 television miniseries planet earth narrated by my childhood idol david attenborough nevertheless whether it was screened down here in australia or not i never caught up with it and when i happened upon the opportunity to see earth 2007  a featurelength compilation of the same nature footage  on the big screen i jumped at the chance the theatre was basically empty just one other patron sat in the row ahead of me and it was as though i had not only the big screen to myself but indeed the entire planet earth for 90 minutes i was lowered into the beauty and perils of the isolated wilderness amongst some of the most beautiful living creatures ever captured on film awesome in its scope and yet painfully intimate at times earth is a heartfelt plea from the filmmakers to recognise the delicate balance of life on our planet and how the intrusion of humans has placed countless glorious animal and plant species on the brink of extinctionbr br though the film directed by alastair fothergill and mark linfield obviously argues for the conservation of the wilderness it refrains from beating us over the head with propaganda and the puzzle that is politics is ignored altogether indeed there is not a human in sight instead we are simply taken on a breathtaking journey into the majesty of the natural world to experience the resilience and also the fragility of life on earth i hear that the original miniseries which ran for eleven episodes delves a lot deeper into the scientific background of world ecosystems but i think that here the filmmakers made a wise decision to replace information with emotional impact i cant remember the last time that i felt so inspired and yet utterly heartbroken at the same time by establishing an emotional link between the audience and a select few individual animals anthropomorphising them to an extent we are suddenly able to appreciate the human side of each species and their hopeless plight for survival becomes less a statistic and more an unacceptable tragedybr br earth is basically comprised of a selection of dramatic episodes whether it be the struggles of a female polar bear to lead her young cubs to the arctic ice or the tramp of an elephant herd towards the lifesaving seasonal floodwaters of the okavango delta the documentary demonstrates the delicate balance between life and death most heartbreakingly exhibited in the desperate ballet of predatorprey interactions though occasionally perhaps to cater towards a younger audience the footage cuts itself short at the crucial moment i regularly shed at tear at the inevitability of death in nature and the raw instinct that fuels these animals final hopeless efforts at survival theres even a haunting beauty to be found in the hunt both in the slowmotion footage of a cheetah bringing down its prey the result of a single fateful misstep or the majestic midair leap of a great white shark as it engulfs a hapless sea lion it is this frail balance that has been fatally disrupted by the selfishness of our own speciesbr br aside from these main stories we are also treated to brief snippets of wildlife from around the world including the birds of paradise of papua new guinea and the autumn migration of the demoiselle cranes of course entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone and an inevitable consequence of having to sift through so much footage is that some interesting ecosystems are glossed over far took quickly by choosing to focus most closely on the polar bear elephant and humpback whale  tracing their lifestyles via some astonishing highdefinition timelapse photography throughout a calender year  the filmmakers were able to avoid any structural problems that might arise from having so much to show and only 90 minutes to show it consequently earth left me thirsting for more and fortunately i now have approximately eleven hours more as soon as i can track down a copy of the dvd boxset for planet earth uplifting and tearjerking aweinspiring and heartrending earth is a truly magnificent documentary experience and it might just be my favourite film of 2007
2,i cant think of much to say about this film br br this was an awful moviei cant even tell you what made me decide to view it it had so few redeeming qualities that i dont even know where to beginbr br the plot moved from implausible to downright absurd my entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because i could not wait for the awful thing to be over and done by the end of the movie i found myself feeling beyond relieved br br the editing was poor the acting was subpar and the storyline was weak francoise robinson was cast as a native american even though she does not even closely resemble someone of native american heritage br br if a movie is going to be this idiotic it should be laughably stupid  at the very least it wasnt it was just pathetic
2,this film is excellently paced you never have to wait for a belly laugh to come up for more than about a minute and theres much more going on than the initial premise of the film throughout it there are mockeries of the traditional schmaltzy localboysdonegoodovercomingadversity genre of which this parodies dont let anyone tell you that theyre trying to get cheap laughs just by using obscenities sure theres plenty of that but its all contextual not gratuitous i loved this film and it only cost me 299 on dvd  so in terms of entertainment value for money it has been the best film ive seen this year
5,brando plays the ace jet pilot just back from shooting migs down in the korean war on leave he discovers his madame butterfly falls in love the lovers both see the folly of racism and the cruelty which conservative cultural norms can bring to human relationsbr br this film is an excellent romance with a nice twist which rejects the racist conservative standards dominant at the time it was made in 1957 sayonara will make you laugh and cry beware though sometimes the musical background will make you wish it was not there although irving berlins title song will entice your memory for a very long time after your theatre lights come on again
4,many critics have felt offended that rw fassbinder has portrayed both protagonist wilkie and the nazis in this movie in a humanlike manner connoisseurs of other fassbinder films however will realize that lili marleen 1981 belongs to fassbinders women movies like the marriage of maria braun 1979 and lola 1981 fassbinder was convinced that stories can be told much better with women than with men because according to fassbinder while men usually fulfill their determined roles in society women are capable of thinking in a dialectic manner dialectics however means that there is not only a thesis and its antithesis like usually in our blackandwhite world but a synthesis where the oppositions coincide moreover dialectic means that because of the third instance of synthesis the absolute opposition of the difference between thesis and antithesis is abolished concretely speaking starting from a dialect point of view and portraying the fascist state the underground fighters must necessarily use the basic means like the rulers do and between offenders and victims there is thus a chiastic relation so that every offender is also victim and every victim is also offender fassbinder has illustrated this abstract scheme that transcends classical logic in his play the city the garbage and the death 1975 which was filmed by daniel schmid under the title shadow of angels 1976br br therefore approaching an a priori controversial topic like nazi germany in a dialectic manner the depiction of this time in the form of a movie gets even more controversial especially for people who cannot or do not want to see that our recognition of the world is by far not exhausted with a primitive lightswitch schema but needs the third instance of synthesis as controlling instance of its opposite members thesis and antithesis the mutual relationship between offenders and victims has to scrutinized since it is simply not true that the offenders are the bad ones and the victims the good ones in a synthetic viewpoint the bad ones participate on the goodness as the good ones participate on the badness they are mutually related in a worldview based on classical logic a relation between good and bad cannot even been established and in an ethics based on this insufficient system of logic the bad conscience of the survivors of nazi germany feeling illogically enough responsible for the deeds of their ancestors exclude the possibility of a relationship between the two extremes and thus a synthesis in the form a new evaluation based on this relationship as well from fassbinders dialectic viewpoint it follows that neither lili marleen nor lola nor maria braun can be condemned for their misuse of the ruling system for their private purposes because they dont misuse them they just use them in the opposite since victims must repeat the actions of the offenders as the offenders must repeat the actions of the victims because good and bad are no longer simple mirror images of one another like in twovalued logic their strategies are legitimated by the chiastic structure of a logic that describes our world that is not black and white at all much better than a blackandwhite logic
6,there isnt much to say about this film it is horriblebr br the acting and dialog are way far away from even decent the story of the hybrid werewolfs is not very well explained and the whole thing has plot holes here and therebr br cgi is something you wouldnt like to see it so amateurish that it makes me vomitbr br the only good thing on the dvd was in the extras the gag reel everything else just waste of time and money i hope noone will buy this this is not even worth rentingbr br just stay away of this
5,im going to keep this fairly brief as to not spoil anything for you this movie is awesome from beginning to end it is filled with genuine thrills the fight scenes are fantastic the chase scenes are enthralling and it moves at such a pace that it really only felt slow toward the end when things are explained but that is only because everything that preceded it damon shines and really has proved a very solid actor daring you not to believe him in this role he is this role a welcome addition to the series in david straithrain hope i spelled that close to right as a seedy cia agent out to kill bourne this is non stop and will truly leave you on the edge of your seat for most of the way some things toward the end are just a smidgeon preposterous thus negating a 10 rating the ending is left open for sequels and i sure hope that they consider doing more of these for none have been bad excellent film all in all and a fantastic ending to an amazing trilogybr br ps the shaky cam did not hurt any of the action but i still think we could do without it the good news is you only really notice it when people are talking and not so much the action
0,now i like scifi cartoons however when robotboy appeared in canada in late 2006 i watched the premiere and was inevitably appalled the characters are generic and stereotypical do they really need to make an africanamerican man wear tigerstripe print clothing and speak in a jamacian accent why are all the asian characters vibrant yellow and squinting does the mother have to have big thighs and chest and constantly complain to the point where things become unrealistic predictable gross and sometimes disturbing there are heavy similarities to even stabs at astro boy allow me to explain dub names for the young robotboyastro kamikazetenma constantineshadow gusabercrombie tommyalejo lolazorankennedy moshimooshay and it so on brief resemblances to my life as a teenage robot star wars teenage mutant ninja turtles kamen riders sailor moon and co are afoot not to mention the abundant racialgender stereotyping dont even get me started on the innuendos ill just say theyre hidden and quite dirty but seriously dont even try watching this especially if you like astro boy
6,this is absolutely the dumbest movie ive ever seen what a waste of a splendid cast thats james cromwell as the ignoramus playing deputy i could go on and on but i would obviously be spending more time on this review than anybody ever did on the script the only thing this movie is about is us vs them and how to revel in profane slapstick beyond any reasonable human beings tolerance this is one of the 10 worst movies i have ever seen  and i love james garner
4,the incredible melting man is a fantastically gross trashy and energetic zgrade production that every selfrespecting camphorror freak simply has to see for himherself the ideal way to describe this lowbudget 70s gem is like a shameless copy of hammers the quatermass xperiment only a thousand times filthier astronaust steve west is the only survivor of a disastrous spacemission but turns out the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and  causes him to melt in shock after seeing his face in the mirror can you blame him steve busts out of the hospital leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off body parts behind doctor ted nelson has to find him urgently as the disease also set steve up with an insatiable appetite for human flesh the premise may sound utterly stupid but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great makeup effects from the hand of rick baker the melting dudes face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like darth vader another big advantage is that william sachs screenplay doesnt waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches the repulsiveness starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of the film just enjoy this silly horror gem and try to switch off your brain activity as much as you can because if you start contemplating about the many stupidities in the script youll miss out on all the campy fun
5,a young man named court is loved by everyone his painful bloody death brings everyone closer you can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie whether predictable or not and irrespective of ecclesiastical beliefs this is a moving story full of milieu and sensualitybr br one other thing someone mentioned that his fate was so quick that it didnt seem plausible but the elements for this are set up subtly note what his mom says about bringing his lunch out to the field note how he is holding the steering wheel and his gloves he is sweaty and operating dangerous equipment to this day tractors are pretty dangerous
0,i have been familiar with the fantastic book of goodnight mister tom for absolutely ages and it was only recently when i got the chance to watch this adaption of it i have heard lots of positive remarks about this so i had high hopes once this film had finished i was horrifiedbr br this film is not a good film at all goodnight mister tom was an extremely poor adaption and practically 4510 of the book was missed out particularly i found that a lot of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this there was not much dialogue it was rushed and far too fastmoving but i was mostly upset by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between william beech and tom in this film which was a true let down the casting was not all that goodeither i thought this could have been really good but it was so different to the book anextremely poor adaption one of the worst ive seen this deserves a decent remake thatd better be 1000 times better than this pile of garbage
1,i never thought an old cartoon would bring tears to my eyes when i first purchased casper  friends spooking about africa i so much wanted to see the very first casper cartoon entitled the friendly ghost 1945 but when i saw the next cartoon theres good boos tonight 1948 it made me break down i couldnt believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing caspers fox get killed i never saw anything like that in the other casper cartoons this is the saddest one of all it was so depressing i just couldnt watch it again its just like seeing lassie die at the end of a movie i know its a classicbut its too much for us old cartoon fans to handle like me if i wanted to watch something old and classic i rather watch something happy and funny but when i think about this casper cartoon i think about my cats
7,i rented the dubbedenglish version of lensman hoping that since it came from wellknown novels it would have some substance while there were hints of substance in the movie it mostly didnt rise above the level of kiddie cartoon maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book or it lost a lot in the dubbed version or maybe even the source novels were lightweight but for whatever reason there wasnt much therebr br i noticed lots of details that were derivative sloppy poorly dramatized or otherwise deficient some examples the opening scenes looked borrowed from the 2001 star gate scene and the star wars image of hyperspace the robot on the harvester looked like an anthropomorphized r2d2br br it starts out trying to borrow its comic relief style of star wars but mercifully since the humor doesnt work gives up on comedy and plays it serious in that sense its superior to the star wars franchise which started with a clever sense of humor and eventually deteriorated to jarjars annoying sillinessbr br the agricultural details were apparently drawn by someone who had never seen a farm the harvester was driving through the unharvested middle of a field dumping silage onto unharvested crops rather than working from one side to the other and dumping the silage onto alreadyharvested rows or into a truck corn maize was pouring out the grain chute but the farm lands were drawn like a wheat fieldbr br when it was time for kims father had to face his fate there wasnt any dramatic weight to the scene that could have been partly the fault of the englishlanguage voice actor but the drawings didnt show much weight either kims reactions in that scene were similarly unconvincingbr br similarly when a character named henderson was killed chris showed very little reaction even though they were apparently supposed to have been close hendersons death is no spoiler his name isnt revealed until his death scene she seems to promptly forget him someones expression of sympathy shows more feeling than she does i think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in that case theres at least a hint of feeling in the drawings of chrisbr br on several occasions villains fail to accomplish their orders a villain leader often punishes those failures with miserable deaths i cant say whether thats lifted from star wars or if that comes from an earlier source  possibly the lensman booksbr br theres a scene where a space ship crashlands as it plunges toward the ground parts are break off the ship but so many pieces are fall off that there should be nothing left of it by the time it landsbr br while in most cases chris seems like a competent tough space hero theres a scene where she shrieks like an incompetent damsel in distress someone tough enough to get over hendersons death so quickly should at least be able to shout help its got me and i cant reach my gun instead of just shriekingbr br the character with the most personality almost too much at times is dj bill he sounded like wolfman jack the dj in american graffiti i wonder if hes as wellvoiced in the original languagebr br two planets in the movie exploded the explosions were unimpressive and appeared to owe a lot of inspiration to star wars to its credit however the cause of the explosion was completely unlike the death stars primary weapon the dialog had a good interesting explanation for the cause many other explosions in the movie did look good just not the planetary explosionsbr br some of the sound effects are very cheesy as if borrowed from a late 1970s video game some of the images look like primitive video games and some influence from tron is visible too on the other hand the sound effects are often pretty decent although that emphasizes the cheesysounding parts the art is good too particularly when it stays away from the often cheesylooking computer graphicsbr br finally theres the story if a movie tells a good story it can get away with a lot of production shortcomings but the plot here was pretty lightweight a nave boy tries to help someone on a crippled space ship and acquires a great power he doesnt understand he and his band of very virtuous companions struggle against a powerful unredeemably evil enemy he makes friends learns about his special power and grows into a young man if he is persistent and virtuous enough he might even defeat the evil enemy details along the way can make such a story rise above the simple outline but theres very little more than that in this moviebr br in the end its just a kiddie cartoon but then since it looks like the primary intended audience is older children maybe it doesnt need to be anything more than that
0,when i first read armistead maupins story i was taken in by the human drama displayed by gabriel no one and those he cares about and loves that being said we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of hollywoodbr br writer armistead maupin and director patrick stettner have truly succeeded br br with just the right amount of restraint robin williams captures the fragile essence of gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel lifejess and the world around himdonnabr br as we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably the request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forwardbr br its to bad that most people will avoid this film i only say that because the average american will probably think robin williams in a serious role that didnt work before please give this movie a chance robin williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people like his movie one hour photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of artbr br oh and before i forget i believe bobby cannavale as jess steals every scene he is in he has the 1940s leading man looks and screen presence its this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right nowbr br s
1,passport to pimlico is a real treat for all fans of british cinema not only is it an enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining comedy but it is a cinematic flashback to a bygone age with attitudes and scenarios sadly now only a memory in british lifebr br stanley holloway plays pimlico resident arthur pemberton who after the accidental detonation of an unexploded bomb discovers a wealth of medieval treasure belonging to the 14th century duke of burgundy that has been buried deep underneath their little suburban street these last 600 yearsbr br accompanying the treasure is an ancient legal decree signed by king edward iv of england which has never been officially rescinded to state that that particular london street had been declared burgandian soil which means that in the eyes of international law pemberton and the other local residents are no longer british subjects but natives of burgundy and their tiny street an independent country in its own right and a law unto itselfbr br this sets the warbattered and impoverished residents up in good stead as they believe themselves to be outside of english law and jurisdiction so in an act of drunken defiance they burn their ration books destroy and ignore their clothing coupons flagrantly disregard british licencing laws etc declaring themselves fully independent from britainbr br however what then happens is ever spiv black marketeer and dishonest crook follows suit and crosses the border into burgundy as a refuge from the law and postwar restrictions to sell their dodgy goods and half of londons consumers follow them in order to dodge the ration making their quiet happy little haven a den of thieves and a rather crowded one at thatbr br appealing to whitehall for assistance they are told that due to developments this is now a matter of foreign policy which his majestys government is reluctant to become involved which leaves the residents high and dry they do however declare the area a legal frontier and as such set up a fully equipped customs office at the end of the road mainly to monitor smuggling than to ensure any safety for the residents of pimlicobr br eventually the border is closed altogether starting a major siege with the bugundian residents slowly running out of water and food but never the less fighting on in true british style as one bugundian resident quotes were english and we always were english and its just because we are english we are fighting so hard to be bugundians br br a sentiment that is soon echoed throughout the capital as when the rest of london learn of the poor bugundians plight they all feel compelled to chip in and help them by throwing food and supplies over the barbed wire blockadesbr br will whitehall who has fought off so may invaders throughout the centuries finally be brought to its knees by this new batch of foreigners especially as these ones are english br br great tale and great fun throughout not to be missed
6,not everything is said in this excellent first feature from cline sciamma the friendship the wanting to fit in the first sexual feelings all this and much more is sublimated through the underwater synchro swimming scenesbr br all three girls in the movie try to find and express their personality in a very different way it is a much less violent approach to the understanding of the teenage years compared to say thirteen but a very worthwhile trip nonethelessbr br a must see and please leave all american cinematographic preconceptions at he door the soundtrack is a by the waybr br bon cinma 
4,i havent seen much german comedy but if this film is anything to go by im compelled to see more the simple but effective storyline takes two very different people on a trip from germany to italy after eva an unemployed mother of two discovers that her artist husband is having an affair with the wife of a wealthy lawyer i wont reveal anything further but what results is a very funny series of events with the perfect conclusion my interest in international cinema has expanded since i first saw this film i recommend it to anyone any adult dont let the inclusion of the young children fool you into thinking its a family film who love comedy  even those unfamiliar with the language
6,the animation looks like it was done in 30 seconds and looks more like caricatures rather than characters ive been a fan of scooby doo ever since the series premiered in 1969 i didnt think much of the scooby doo animated movies im talking about the tv series not the full length movies but some of them were pretty cool and i like most people found scrappy doo to be an irritant but this series is pure garbage as soon as i saw the animation and heard the characters and i use that term loosely speak i cringed also mystery inc was a team and without the entire crew to compliment each other it just seems like opening up a box of chocolates to find someone has already ate the best ones and the only thing left are the ones nobody wants whats new scooby doo was better than this if youre going to have a scooby doo tv series include the elements that made the series endure so long the entire cast of characters and quality animation they need to put this one back under the rock from where it came
1,i read somewhere that hollywood should concentrate on remaking bad movies and leave the classics alone we can only hope while this remake wasnt a total waste i still wish i had the six bucks back to go toward a dvd of the original lots of violence and one of the worst endings ive ever seen this version doesnt add anything new it only reiterates why hollywood should leave the good stuff alone
0,i suck at gratuitous boob references so im just going to write a plainly flat no pun intended review i love elvira not in a imgoingtoshootthepresjusttoimpressjodifosterfanatical way but suffice to say i think she rocks the movie is played like a 50s horror film only alot more fun look for the leasurely stroking of the ankle reference to know what i mean what relay shines through in the movie is elviras or should that be cassandras absolute charm i first saw this movie at the tender age of and have seen it contless times since i realy should get around to buying a copy the videostore version is looking a little worse for the wear if any other fans of the movie want to email me about it feel freebr br ps another great performance from edie mcclurg chastedy pariah an actress who never gets the attention she deserves
1,i originally scored sarahs show with a nice fat but ive struggled a bit with her humor of late and a thin is whats settled in i shall explainbr br you will either like sarahs humor or you wont if you dont i doubt anyone could persuade you you folks know who you are and its perfectly fine but then you know that too moving on the first season gave us fantastic bits about sarah her friends and family and her pursuits in life in one memorable episode she is pulled over by officer jay whom she meets for the first time  do you know why i am standing here he asks because you got all cs in high school she quizzically replies it seemed to be a genuine question  that is funny stuff in my book sarah can come at you from odd angles in another episode her affair with god was notably funny god being petty and jealous added wonderfully to the joke it is clever it is a twisted view but she would show us the truth in the humor and we laughedbr br then came the second season while still not without some new and inventive comedy we seem to have slipped somewhat into banal poop and fart jokes quite simply i get some good laughs here and there but much of it seems like filler while she and the writers struggle to foment some original material sophomoric and tiresome are the feelings i have for the episodes lately but i have been gutting it out for the gems i do find the turtle and waiting for her to turn it around i was a fan of her jesus is magic routine and would like to think that i understand what she is capable of lets get back to that

4,this is one of my alltime favorites great music and some funny bits i laugh every time at millie the maid pretending to be a dbutante holding her dainty hankie while chatting and mindlessly polishing furniture with it as she chats i just never can get past her french accent never being a problem as they try to pass her off as the bosss daughterbr br seeing a teenage mel torme and the very young frank sinatra singing is such a treat my mom saw frank sinatra at a theater about the same time this movie came out she said they couldnt clear the bobbysoxers out between movies in those days you didnt have to leave between showings this movie shows you how attractive and appealing the young frank was and allows you to appreciate his early talent as well and victor borge gets in a bit of his routine in which is a bonus br br this is a fun movie with a sweet simple storyline very enjoyable
3,i bought this it was only ok under the title grey matter the novelty of seeing sherriff roscoe in a nondukesofhazzard role intrigued me as the other reviewers warned its a pretty boring tale of a top secret government experiment gone awrybr br and yes there are plenty of establishing shots especially of a house with a pool in front of it some of the characters and interiors are so nondescript i guess the filmmakers worried we might forget who is who so they keep tipping us off by first showing the outside of the buildings its actually kinda funny after awhile the pool shot feels like a tv channels station identification logo reminding us that we are watching grey matterbr br i also enjoyed two bouts of namecalling at one point an angry test subject taunts somebody in charge by calling her a scientific btch its just a very inadequate insult several scenes later a different subject lets off steam by muttering about that scientific btard it just sounded very awkward to mebr br someday this movie will disappear forever another decade from now it will likely be impossible to find any copies of it almost like it never happenedbr br 
4,this movie has problems in its presentation may even be offensive to people who are looking for temporal and cultural faithfulness but it challenges the watcher to reflect on a variety of issues one of these is the nature and character of the relationship between jesus and judas another is that of the historical nature of the bible and faith and third is the humanity of jesus the tension of the christbetrayer relationship is developed and held through the movie judas passion is presented as a darker parallel to that of christ when judas takes his own life the viewer can sense the angst peters denial and guilt however moving are not as powerfully portrayed as the judas drama chris sarandon offers a novel and provocative christ whether believable or not i would like to find this movie on dvd or even vhs to use in study or discussion groups
2,probably my alltime favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but its not preachy or boring it just never gets old despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years paul lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight the kids are as grandma says more like dressedup midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch and the mothers slow awakening to whats happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling if i had a dozen thumbs theyd all be up for this movie
6,im sorry for jean after having such a good original movie to be followed up by perhaps his worst movie in is career this movie was shot down terribly by horrible acting jobs by goldbegromeo and whatever that computers name was also some scenes may have been just a little unnesicary truly bad movie
4,great movie enough laughs and action for any audiencebr br since the last person who posted on this movie took it upon themselves to call woody allen incestuous and not comment on the film here i ambr br the film follows an unlikely duo johansson and allen as they follow a tip given to them by the ghost of a recently deceased english reporter their search takes them into the home of the killer and eventually to a somewhat tragic end but dont let the plot fool you the film truly is hilarious and the acting is superbbr br it seems that as directors reach a certain age they really get things right clint eastwood allen and pollack all seem to making some of the most imaginative work of their respective careers also from watching the movie in a pact theater you can just tell that people really love woody allen and are ready for him to really make a comeback the second he walked on screen audience lit up theres just something about the man and he really shines in scoop br br check it out its worth the trip
6,the odd couple is a comic gem one the funniest script ever committed to celluloid  exceeded only by strangelove spinal tap and lebowski lemmon and matthau are best friends obsessive compulsive felix and sloppy irresponsible oscar oscars wife has already left him because he is impossible to live with due to his irresponsible attitude felixs wife leaves him at the start of the movie and after an aborted suicide attempt he moves in with poker buddy oscar thats when the fun beginsbr br the entire script is brilliant and filled with brilliant oneliners you are probably already familiar with the fu joke but it still works brilliantly due to matthaus comic timingbr br my favorite moments are when lemmon tries to clear his sinus in the diner and when the pigeon sisters are being charmed by a very suave matthau and lemmon is totally out of his element this one requires repeat viewings
6,i watched this last night with low expectations the reasons being i dont usually like made for tv movies and rarely have i liked cast reunion movies but the critic in the los angeles times seemed to like this so i gave it a chance im glad i did it was pretty good adam west and burt ward reunite as themselves but in a way they were acting as their batman and robin selves they were being campy and not taking themselves or this movie too seriously the movie starts out with them searching for the george barris designed batmobile that someone stole before it was to be auctioned off for an orphans home while they are searching for the car they are also reminiscing about the series that they did together this is told in flashback it was well done the actors that they got for the younger burt ward and adam west were dead on and for a tv movie it got down to the nittygritty about their real behavior on and off the screen i give this one a 910 i liked it that much
2,this movie was not so much promoted here in greeceeven though it got good actors  great script and rather good photograph was not a so called blockbuster movie in my country the movie itself is very powerfulits about the hard time that a newcomer had to go through when he returns in his homevillage after been released from a 5yo prison timedrugs the end is rather sad mourikis is trying to keep up with his part and he handles it pretty well lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a strange way and of course hatzisavvas is for one more time close to excellency out of 10 because very few greek movies can make such an impression
7,to moviethis movie felt like one of those after school specialsonly lower budget and lower everything elsei guess this was supposed to an inspirational movie of some sortbut it didnt work for meyet some how it comes across as preachyit has very pale shades of flash dancebut so whatthere just isnt any excitement in this moviethe dialogue is contrived and clichd to deathof coursethe whole movie feels like a bad 80s clichthe acting was less than stellarthough that has a lot to do with what the actors were givenor in this casenotto work withon top of that is the poor song choiceswith really bad lyricsi felt embarrassed for all the actors involvedthey are all talentedbut you cant tell from this moviethis is just my opinion of coursebut i have to give flying aka dream to believe a 110
6,i am not so much like love sick as i image finally the film express sexual relationship of alex kik sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness frustration and jealous at last alex waked up and realized that they would not have result and futureending up was sadbr br the director tudor giurgiu was in amc theatre on sunday 1200pm on 081006 with us watched the movie together after the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of romanian were kind of complicatebr br on my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere i dont feel any particular impression and effect from the movie the love proceeding of alex and kiki and kiki and her brother sandu were kind of next door neighborhood storybr br the two main reasons i dont like this movie are firstly the film didnt told us how they started to fall in love sounds like after alex moved into the building which kiki was living then two girls are fall in love it doesnt make sense at all how a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man too much fragments you need to image and connect those stories by your mind secondly the whole film didnt have a scene of alex and kiks sexual intercourse that s what i was waiting for however it still had some parts were deserved to recommend the ear piercing  part was kind of interesting alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kiks love that was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love also the scene of they were lying in the soccer field the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate
4,i became more emotionally attached to this movie than any other i have ever watched that may be because i can see the characters as my own grandparents attempting to make sense of a world at war the ending and use of pachabels cannon are both amazing
4,bernard rapp passed away last year and was a very cultured journalist cinema was one of his biggest passions he penned a vast worldwide dictionary of films and so he was bound to wield a camera at least one time in his life but the films he left garnered lukewarm reviews tir  part 1996 in spite of terence stamps sensational performance was very caricatured in the depiction of the characters une affaire de got 2000 was a slick affair even if bernard giraudeau delivered a perverse performance pas si grave 2003 was another letdown and un petit jeu sans consquence is as underwhelming as its predecessors its comic potential is exploited in a flimsy waybr br and however the starting idea let predict a twirling spiritual comedy a couple held by yvan attal and sandrine kiberlain who invited their friends is in full moving in a lascivious mansion to play with their guests they pretend to part company with each other and things dont go as planned because the announcement of their separation doesnt surprise them the two lovers start to ponder about the validity of their couplebr br in spite of lush scenery and the promising material he had at his disposal rapps undistinguished directing cant manage to give life to this game with unexpected consequences the plot follows a wellworn pattern with characters who have specific wellknown functions and masks that are unveiled about who they really are verbal or situation comic effects often fall flat a bad editing fades a little more the film with this bad habit from rapp to abruptly cut many sequences even the actors sincere input in the venture is debatable they seem to be bored and to recite their texts than to live them especially sandrine kiberlain the audience is soon caught in a deep torporbr br its regrettable to say it bernard rapps films never lived up to his intentions as un petit jeu sans consquence bears witness
2,this film and its sequel barry mckenzie holds his own are the two greatest comedies to ever be produced a great story a young aussie bloke travels to england to claim his inheritance and meets up with his mates who are just as loveable and innocent as he isbr br its chock a block full of great sayings  where else could you find someone who needs a drink so bad that hes as dry as a dead dingoes donger great characters top acting and its got great sheilas and more fosters consumption then any other three films put together top notchbr br and some of the funniest songs youll ever hear and its full of great celebrities definitely my two favourite films of all time i watch them at least once a fortnight
7,this is just a bad movie with what seemed to be quite a nice budget it had potential to be much better it almost were with the heroine beautiful almost like salma hayek hero fighting almost like jackie chan battles and duels almost like in crouching tiger music almost like in say conan etc almost but in the end its just dull and it is hard to find anything interesting in it maybe apart of john rhysdavies flying in duel like those warriors in hero or beforementioned crouching tiger i am really ashamed of poor old john he is after all quite a good actor and deserves much better so as you  so if you still have a chance just watch something else
6,well the story is a little hard to follow the first time but thats only because of all the bare breasted 70s paintedup vampirewitches dancing to the bongo drums this of course interrupted by a few vampiric orgies and there are some very interesting candles and uses for them and for girl on girl action vampiric or notthis movie just rocks
0,very light spoilers maybe br br normally a fan of diane keaton i tried to watch this tonight i had to switch it off before the second hour because i found myself with absolutely no sympathy for daughter or mother both came across as selfabsorbed with little regard for others with the daughter also adding in rude disrespectful and reckless to the mix when the daughter died the only thing i thought was at least we wont have to watch her anymore keaton did a good job of moving into her stunned state and into the grieving but it was too far gone for me by then i simply wasnt enjoying it so i stopped watching if you want me to care for the protagonist you need to get me caring about the characters much soonerif its nearly an hour in and i dont care its too latebr br the supporting cast was sincere and well playedi felt for themand the gay best friend was wonderful but even combined that wasnt enough to carry the film for me
1,for the most part on demand delivers some pretty horrible horror movies and only offers other horror movies everyone has already seen and already have an opinion on it was either this or invinicible i like mark wahlberg movies which i havent seen and i was actually in a movie watching mood which doesnt happen often anymore because ive already watched all the movies i own a million times and thats a lot of movies and i dont have much interest in new movies and boy this movie made me regret it im not going to put in any spoilers im just going to tell you that only a few of the very few actors in this movie are half way decent i think the main girl the dead one who kills everyone is very annoying looking but convincing id take her for psycho bitch anyday so she fits her roll well though it is lame the blood isnt that great only a few of the kills or may i say woundings are alright but you dont see much and there are no body part props in the movie to make the injuries look more convincing towards the end of the movie i was begging my girlfriend to turn it off and being a band member the recording parts werent very interesting either though what happened would truly happen when going about recording im done if you want to watch this suit yourself
0,sadly the print of the film we were going to watch burned in the fire at universal studios last week so we were stuck with video that could even be a metaphor for this secondrate king kong movie from toho studios stalwart director ishiro honda essentially its a warm up for king kong versus godzilla it even uses the idea of a mechakong like mechagodzilla of course the movie climaxes with king kong fighting mechakong on top of the expo tower in tokyo but if you didnt know that already then maybe youre in the age group that this movie was intended forbr br the cast is headed by a guy named rhodes reason who we had never heard of glancing over his list i see mostly a lot of scattered american tv credits so its interesting that they dragged him all the way to japan so that they could have a nominal american hero the real hero of the movie is the more sensitive japanese commander played by akira takarada who i recognized from hiroshi inagakis iconic version of chushingura 47 ronin and also from the original godzilla films by honda im sorry rhodes reason whoever you are but this guy has way more screen presence and you can bet that everyone wants him to end up with the cute little blonde played by linda miller we laughed at the way reason would always find a way to interject himself between miller and takarada who it seemed like she kind of preferred of course like all kong leading ladies her primary relationship is with the king himself she discovers a nice trick if you talk to a giant ape really really slowly hell understand what youre saying and if youre a blonde gal that means that hell do whatever you tell him to do that fact is not lost on dr who eisei amamoto and madame piranha mie hama  representing a nation which shall not be named  who plan on using her as bait to get kong to dig up mineral deposits that are trapped at the north polebr br yes this is truly the plot of the whole movie  apparently only a giant ape is going to be capable of digging out these minerals which can be used to make super powerful weapons dr who builds mechakong to get it but the circuitry gets in the way so they decide to go for the real kong kong himself seems momentarily infatuated with mechakong a story element that might have made the film more interesting but wasnt followed up onbr br by the end of the movie the cute blonde has shouted kong or king kong in her chirpy voice so many times that when the two heroes tell her to let him go at the end theyre speaking for all of us basically this movie squanders whatever majesty was possible in the kong character by making him a heroic and friendly figure much too early just like the newest version of the story kong is just a guy in a suit in this movie and they show quite a lot of him to the point where the goofy face becomes impossible to take seriously its a nice looking movie im sure it satisfies the demands or desires of fans of this type of thing which is really more of a wrestling film than a monster film in a lot of ways the monsters dont ever really scare in these films they just jump around and push each other around a lot its not a worthless movie but its extremely predictable and formulaic so for anyone under the age of 10 or so it probably will only be entertaining as comedy
3,i had been looking forward to seeing this film for a long time after seeing return to paradise which i found to be gritty i was so disappointed the most realistic thing about it was the unpredictable ending which i think was partly stolen from return to paradise br br maybe i was expecting too much br br on the positive side danes beckinsale and pullman were fantastic in their roles although i didnt like daness character and first and found her very annoying br br i couldnt see anything realistic about the film it could of been done so much better for example there could of been more emphasis on the prison conditions and the sheer horror it was too cheery a movie to be realistic there could also of been more action and tensionbr br the best thing about this film is the tragic ending i couldnt of predicted that but by that time i really didnt care what happened to thembr br 310
7,i havent laughed this hard at a movie in a long time i got to go to an advance screening and was thrilled because i had been dying to see it i had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie the audience all shared my laughter and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the moviebr br kudos to steve carrellwho i had already been a fan of he proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy he has a style that i havent seen before and catherine keener is excellent as always thank god there wasnt a cameo from will ferrelllove him but saw him too much this summerbr br there were parts of comedic genius in this movie partly thanks to carrell and partly thanks to the writingalso carrell the waxing scene and the speed dater with the obvious problem were absolutely hystericalbr br i will definitely go see 40 year old virgin when its released my advice go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it
5,i loved this movie and will watch it again original twist to plot of man vs man vs self i think this is kurt russells best movie his eyes conveyed more than most actors words perhaps theres hope for mankind in spite of government intervention
0,von trier once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world so as viewers we think we watch a true story while in fact we are thoroughly manipulated often to the point that the movie works disturbing dancer in the dark or painful the idiots idioterne of course the dogmefilms acted only as a vehicle for this theory besides creating some welcome spotlight on von trierbr br the story is typical for von trier our hero is idealistic seems to balance his relations with everybody else but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves the idealist inevitably has to reject society in order to stay idealistic and becomes the terrorist mankind is spoiled and purity only leads to selfdestruction these elements were also very omnipresent in breaking the waves and dancer in the dark the movie is also full of cynical even humorous undertones about the role of the germans and americans in postwar germanybr br as a technical achievement the movie is wonderfully designed shifting and fading washedout colors screen overlays action on different overlays with the shooting of the soontobe mayor as the most interesting in this movie we can see how good von triers handles film as a technical medium in his later works he seems to step down from this as if he is not longer interested in technical achievements because they become so easily available
5,emma is a true romance if you love the soppy stuff charged with wit and folly you will love this movie its true to the novel which is very important with a few twists added for pleasure gwen is not one of my fave actreesess but she does justice to a role that required everything that she had to offer in spades she shines in a role i think no other actress could have done proper justice to br br jeremy northam as the hero how shocked are you i never looked upon him as overtly handsome but heck what the right role can do for you he looks so good as the sensible regal mr k that i am literally looking at him in a new light he makes and excellent romantic lead the charm and character that he brings to his role is wonderfulbr br ewan mcgregor greta sacchi brings in the rest a good cast a good movie if you are a fan of jane austen see this movie along with pride and prejudice  and most importantly buy the books it enhances the movie to heights that are extraordinary
6,footlight parade is just one of several wonderfully jaunty musicals that warner bros produced in the early 1930s to ward off the depression 42nd street and the golddiggers series were also produced during this era and they made literally millions of americans forget their troubles for a little while and enjoy themselvesbr br while most of the films produced had the great talents of joan blondell ruby keeler and dick powell only foolight parade had the incomparable james cagney almost ten years prior to his most wellknown musical yankee doodle dandy here he dances in that most original of dance styles with his arms usually lowered at his side and his legs doing all types of undulations and kicks its easy to see that he is enjoying himself and that makes us enjoy him all the morebr br while almost all of the musical sequences appear at the end of the film they are well worth the wait i believe that this film was made just prior to the installation of the production code so some of the costumes and scenes are a bit risqu but its all in funbr br it doesnt matter what the plot of the film is just know that there are plenty of laughs and a superlative cast besides those already mentioned guy kibbee is at his flustered best herebr br out of 10
0,i cant believe that steven segals career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrongbr br the plot is unbelievable as a movie and even if you excuse the visuals and had read this story as a novel youd be left wondering why you had even picked up the bookbr br steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation he shows no effort and no enthusiasm and in some scenes he doesnt show up at allbr br i hate to repeat other peoples comments but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic the condition of those scenes chopped in is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleanerbr br my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds i read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget segal being paid of that and that the movie still came in under budget i must concurbr br it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie as no conscientious theatre owner would play this movie 
1,the earth is destined to be no more thanks to father pergado and a bunch of nuns christopher lee who has since said that he was duped in to appearing in this by his producers who told him loads of great actors were involved is father pergado and gets to do his usual serious and scary routine the cast are not too bad though most have now retired from acting the film has terrible sound effects mainly created from pressing keys on an old computer it seems and it ridiculously pondering at times  showing a scene of the sky for instance for what feels like hours at a time despite this the story is pretty humorous in a worldisdoomed sort of way and the production is adequate interestingly one scene features albert band and wife jackie meda band writer frank ray perilli and charles bands assistant bennah burton despite its plodding nature i genuinely wanted to see how it all worked out and thus quite liked it
6,let me start out by saying i will try not to put too many spoilers in this normally i enjoy robin williams movies however this gem was not one of them it was billed as a suspenseful thriller the night listener was anything but to be blunt there were people in the theater opening day walked out for good reason the movie was in my opinion poorly written and directed the acting was alright but again there wasnt anything to work with the movie is about a storyteller who reads a good book by a dying kid however insert spooky here no one can verify the kids existence so williams goes to wisconsin to try and find the author however all he gets is a headache and excuses from the boys caretaker there thats it thats all you wait for about an hour and a half and movie ends it had as many thrills and chills as a dentist office visit the homosexual undertones or overtones had really nothing to do with the story and the movie had a little profanity but it seemed to be thrown in there for absolutely no reason and made little sense in conclusion i really cant write a decent review on this film because there was nothing to it it was as captivating as watching paint dry i gave it a because the acting for what it was worth was alright and it wasnt directed by uwe boll
0,this movie just goes to show that you dont need big explosionsmutibillion dollar computer graphicsor highly over paid actors and actresses to make a good movie all you need is a excellent story line and plot which the master of all japanese filmsakira kurosawa pulls off brilliantly i recommend this film to all that love a epic period piece and for those that enjoy kurosawas earlier works 1010
5,after a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted urban turn of the century australian street we meet julie rebecca gibney and peter john adam as they go out house hunting they manage to get a loan for a fixerupper on a posh sydney street but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home it just may be hauntedbr br 13 gantry row combines a memorable if somewhat clichd story with good to average direction by catherine millar into a slightly above average shockerbr br the biggest flaws seem partially due to budget but not wholly excusable to that hurdle a crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film the opening thriller scene features some wonky editing freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that theres not much action suspense should be created from staging not fancy fix it in the mix techniques there is great atmosphere in the scene from the location the lighting the fog and such but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street showing their increasing proximity the tracking and the cuts need to be slow the attack needed to be longer clearer and better blocked as it stands the scene has a strong made for television feel and a low budget one at thatbr br after this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves the story has a lot of similarities to the amityville horror 1979 though the budget forces a much subtler approach millar and scriptwriter tony morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios often dramatic in nature instead of special effectsoriented such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wallbr br for some horror fans the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama at least the first half hour of the film is primarily about julie and peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in but morphett writes fine intelligent dialogue the material is done well enough that its often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise laterespecially if youve gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own housebr br once they get settled and things begin to get weirder even though the special effects often leave much to be desired the ideas are good the performances help create tension there isnt an abundance of death and destruction in the filmtheres more of an abundance of home repair nightmares but neither menace is really the pointbr br the point is human relationships there are a number of character arcs that are very interesting the house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it that its in a posh neighborhood and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe such as money or health problems peters character evolves from a striving corporate employee with normal workbased friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful at the same time we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationshipbr br although 13 gantry row never quite transcends its madefortelevision clunkiness as a tv movie this is a pretty good one with admirable ambitions anyone fond of haunted house films psycho films or horrorthrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy it certainly isnt worth spending 30 for a dvd that was the price my local pbs station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it factoring in shipping and handling but its worth a rental and its definitely worth watching for free

0,i have a minute rule sometimes ill leave leway for 10 if a movie is not good in the first or 10 minutes its probably not going to ever get better i have yet to experience any movie that has proved to contest this theory dan in real life is definitely no exception i was watching this turkey and thought wow this is not funny not touching not sad and i dont like any of the characters at allbr br the story of an advice columnistwidower raising three young daughters who falls in love with his brothers girlfriend i suppose the tagline would be advice columnist who could use advice i dont know dans character in no way struck me as someone qualified to give advice i guess thats the irony i dont know he goes to see his parents brothers sisters and their kids at some sort of anual family retreat which seems very sweet and potential fodder for good comedy story linesnone which ever emerge the central story is basically how he loves this woman but cant have her anyone with a pulse will realise that eventually he will get her but you have to suffer through painfully unfunny trite lifetime movie network dialogue murderer of love to get to the inevitable happy endingbr br this is truly one of the worst movies ive ever seen
0,chase has created a true phenomenon with the sopranos unfaltering performances rocksolid writing and some great music make up what has become quite possibly the best show everbr br all of the cast are strong but falco and gandolfini earned every inch of those emmys anyone who doubts this need only sample a few episodes particularly from the first few seasons james gandolfini is absolutely fierce absolutely terrifying and you still find yourself loving him  mesmerized by himbr br many people that ive spoken to about the sopranos who havent seen it yet will say im just not a fan of mafia moviesshows whatever run  dont walk  and get it those same people usually love er but i bet they dont much care for hospitals its not about the context
0,i saw this film at the international film festival of brussels i also met the director of the film i heard that ed wood wrote the story in 10 years im sure he thought his would be his masterpiece  his triumphbr br well if you take the film seriously like mr wood did it is really one of the worst films you will ever see and this is cool the big joke of i woke up early the day i died is that it doesnt even try to be a decent filmbr br this makes the film very very good the script is filled with nihilism and anarchism  a lot of black humour billy zanes role is absolutely excellent you see this is either high artor low rubbishbr br

7,while this movie isnt a classic by any stretch it is very entertaining as i remember it i saw it about 15 years ago on hbo and loved the movie it was written by the same guy that wrote and directed arthur and though it isnt as funny as that movie it does show the potential that steve gordon reached with arthur
5,i cant add an awful lot to the positive reviews already on here  great acting balanced writing multifaceted characters a great antihero in tony great commentary on millennial american life the integral use of psychiatry coupled with tonys mother issues are especially fresh and humorous several other characters add a lot of depth  heshs interesting history as an outsider muscling in ralphies total irredeemable viciousness chris dual desires in life and so onbr br i have to dig into some of the criticisms however especially the it glorifies violencebelittles italianamericans onemost of the writers and actors are italianamerican would they attack themselves there are several positive italianamerican characters  artie bucco the chef dr melfi and her family and the cusamanos next door to the sopranos indeed dr melfis exhusband notes in season that only a tiny minority of italianamericans have ever had mob connections certainly smaller than the proportion of africanamericans involved in crime dare i say it in both cases poverty and lack of opportunity are the biggest causesbr br most of the characters dont really choose the life they have family background or circumstances largely corner them into it outsiders even of italian stock who attempt to integrate into it usually meet distressing ends  matthew and his friend in season for example if you criticise this show i assume frasier made you want to be a psychiatrist or will  grace made you want to go homosexual presumably you wont listen to rap music that discusses gangs or rnb which discusses promiscuity or rock music which discusses drugs or any other combination people arent as stupid as some of you make outbr br not everything is perfect however a lot of characters have only appeared once when by all logic they should have been seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes  tracee the dancer meadows friend ally uncle juniors ladyfriend supposedly for 20 years until they split in season
5,this period melodrama is one of griffiths earliest claustrophobic films characters trapped within a room are prevalent throughout his work and as time went by he would become increasingly adept at portraying their helplessness and involving the audience in their terror in the bluntly titled sealed room there is one major difference to the normal plot line in that there truly is no escapebr br griffith achieves the claustrophobic effect here in two ways first is his use of space while the typical biograph short might utilise a dozen or more sets the sealed room features only two adjoining rooms  the kings court and the dove cote that becomes the eponymous tomb the set design in these shorts is rarely referenced but here it is crucial the court is a large interior with a backdrop hinting at greater depth and showing us a window and a staircase actors enter and leave from various directions suggesting the room is not only spacious but also free and open by contrast the dove cotes back wall is very close to the camera and the angles in it suggesting a hexagonal or octagonal shape make it seem even more confinedbr br the second technique on display here is the crosscutting anyone with an interest in griffiths work will probably know about his heavy use and development of crosscutting to build excitement or tension many will also know that strictly speaking it wasnt his invention however what makes griffiths crosscuts so effective is the way he paces the opposing images so they complement each other the sealed room contains a good example of what i mean the shots of the masons shifting the heavy bricks have a slow stepbystep pace to them with tension building as the wall gets higher this movement is matched by the shots of the blissfully unaware lovers in which marion leonard tears off flower petals onebyone as the couple realise their predicament their rising panic is complemented by the opposing shot of the king madly thrashing his sword against the wallbr br at this point griffith was yet to realise that the action could be heightened further by introducing a third strand to the crosscut the dramatic ridetotherescue here absent was later to become a standard climax to griffiths pictures
1,seriously  avoid this movie at any cost i just saw it in my first sneak preview ever and although i paid nonrefundable money for it i walked out of the cinema after a mere 15 minutes which already includes minutes of discussion among my friends whether or not to leave first time ever i walked out of a movie and i lived through some pretty bad onesbr br its one of those films that is dubbed and badly so even though it is shown in its original language it relies on the oldest simplest and cheapest jokes in the book on the military what do we do once we reach the fighting zone  you get out of the car and die actually its much funnier to read here that the way it was delivered in the film on drugs a guy eats some space cookies behaves really silly and misses his wedding or has to live through it while high  all badly written and acted on women in the army why do we only get trumpets we were promised guns  thats the way it is thats the way itll stay argh okay you might actually find these genuinely funny but in that case you seriously scare mebr br additionally i have seen better acting in the kind of soft porn films you get on european late night tv so it had lame jokes delivered badly beyond lower average acting lacked pace was badly dubbed and edited  it just didnt work at least not on any level used as a measure for filmsbr br i would even be so bold as to say that this flick proves that there are people who can be a lot less funny zan zee germans and thats saying something if you like stereotypes which i dont its nice to play with them though just in case somebody thinks im not being pc enoughbr br instead of going to see this film do something useful try to teach crocheting to prawns paint your toenails in a really irritating colour disassemble your bicycle change some light bulbs try to understand einsteins theories convert to a different religion and back  in fact go and listen to last christmas by wham on endless repeat anything but dont watch this awful flick

3,kept my attention from start to finish great performances added to this tremendous film mr pacino once again gives us another brilliant character to enjoy
6,i was too young to remmeber when i first saw this movie but i saw it for like the second time about years ago my sister told me i had to see it now my whole family has it memorized we quote it at least once a day i absolutly love this moviei still laugh after all this time sure its about a really really drunk millionare that is irresponsible the whole point is that he still has the humanity lost in the others that we see in the movie and that he is willing to give it all up for love i highly recomend this movie to anyone who wants a laugh a lot of laughs its hallarious sweet and if your a movie buff it will truely change your idea of funny watch it with a group of your friends or your family and i promise you will never have nothing to talk about ever again with some authur lines in your head it will make you laugh for years to comebr br it is really hard in my family to find a movie that everyone likes but this movie i feel made us closer and i know it will do the same for you
0,deathstalker is directed by john watson and it stars rick hill who is some kind of body builder and famous of that if i have understood right the plot follows as deathstalker hill tries to get something back from the evil lord and he has to travel to the lords cave he meets many dwarfs and monsters during his journey and the settings are very close to tolkien and of course conan the barbarian this is a rip off of huge success of conan and even though this is very stupid film it has many nice trash merits and is recommended for trash fans and tolerating film junkiesbr br there are no many cinematic merits in this film couple of scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating but what deathstalker concentrates to show are nude females and huge muscles of hill females are usually helpless victims and very stupid too so this is very macho film and thus may not please many feminists the fight scenes are nothing special and pretty dull and the monsters are not either anything special and all the other aspects of the film are also very amateurish and badly done but what did you expect from low budget effort like this this tries to be as great as conan but fails pretty miserably as i said this can please fans of turkey cinema but no one else this belongs to the category its so bad its greatbr br deathstalker is still not as near as bad as it could be and as a turkey film i appreciate this almost as much as other turkeys enjoyable ones of course if bad films are your cup of tea then try this and have fun but if you dont understand enjoyably bad films then stay away and if somebody cant stand large amount of nudity then stay away as well there is more nudity here than violence and due to these scenes the film has an r rating otherwise this could be some safe pg family filmbr br 410
5,in cold blood is masterfully directed and adapted by richard brooks however its also so bent on being realistic its sometimes more clinical than entertaining recounting the brutal killing of a midwest family author truman capote focused on minutia wrapping himself and the reader up in the subject and subjects brooks departs wildly from that approach in favor of something closer to docudrama although he films on actual locations he keeps his distance the murderers are portrayed as depraved imbeciles which surely they were theyre not seen as misunderstood souls as in the capote book and the savagery of their act is horrifyingly blunt scott wilson and robert blake are excellent as the killers as is the supporting cast including john forsythe and paul stewart as the reporter the capote character the landmark photography is by the great conrad hall
6,whipped is 82 minutes long this review is 82 words long three unlikable new york lotharios ruthless scammers end up wooing the same woman played by amanda peet with disastrous results that applies to the story and the film too sophomoric to be misogynistic flaccid and ridiculous whipped mixes the philosophies of shock jock tom lykis with penthouse letter fantasies though technically proficient its dated grating poorly written mean and obvious people dont act like this people dont talk like this really
7,this was one of those wonderful rare moments in tv that i wished id captured forever on vhs wont it ever air again br br it was so creative and i remember it was aired once a week and the wait for the next episode was excruciating i want to see it all again i want to buy it i want what i cant have not even on ebay br br so having ranted enough it was by far one of the best series the 80s put out it should be considered a classic but is lost in space at least this website and wikipedia mention it sobbr br it was utterly appealing funny flirtatious and original maybe not like sherlock holmes original i actually think quintin is far more attractive and has a better chance with his leading lady than the stiff and chalky holmes ever could
2,a charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town cats and death soon follow them that about sums it upbr br ill admit that i am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie but in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film and believe me there is plenty of that to go around it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experiencebr br the characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on fear greed pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people although it can be argued that that seeming failing in actuality serves the telling of the story the supernatural premise and the fact that it is a stephen king screenplaynot that i have anything specific against mr king are quite nicely supported by some interesting fx work makeup and quite suitable music the absolute gem of this film is without a doubt alice krige who plays mary brady the otherworldly motherbr br king manages to take a simple story of outsider or people who are a little differentokay  a lot in this case trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan
7,in what could have been an otherwise run of the mill mediocre film about infidelity in the sixties the subtle freelove period the creators of this film pile on ridiculous scenario after ridiculous scenario and top it all off with a trite little cherry on top happily ever after ending at no time did i ever feel sympathy for diane lane or anna paquin in their troublesome middleclass care free life nor did i feel for the emasculated liev shrieber the story line plods along slowly to its predictable pathetic conclusion and the only thing interesting and watchable about this film is the stunning diane lane topless heres a hint it occurs about 30 minutes into the film fast forward to that part and skip the rest
3,this is a very fine and poetic story beautiful scenery magnificent music score ive been twice in japan last year and the movie gave me this typical japanese feeling the movement of the camera is superb as well as the actors it goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic japanese people are very sensitive and kind and its all very well brought onto the screen here the director is playing superb with light an colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details once youve seen this movie you will want to see more from the same director its a real feel good movie and i can only recommend it to everybody
5,this deserves a 12 out of 10 an absolutely refreshing show with real characters and real stories this show needs to come back ive seen every episode and this is real qualitybr br the show centers around a couple of new yorkers plays around with the concept of the six degrees of separation and cleverly intertwines their lives bridget moynahan and jay hernandez are stunning and so is the adorable caseman the scenery is amazing and wardrobes are exquisitebr br we need more shows like this that makes viewers feel like they are intelligent individuals not mindless dronesbr br if it never comes back six degrees will be sorely missed
1,i have seen the short movie a few years ago after that i watch all sequels the first one is really not the best  but its the most popular one ive already watch the making of guinea pig its really great what these guys did also the sequels are excellent in the special effects take your chance to watch it
5,cinderella was one of the first movies i ever saw and to me it is timeless it is a lovely looking film with gorgeous animation my favourite animation scene was the dress scene i just love those mice the songs are also lovely not as good as snow whites but they are a delight to sing and are reminiscent of tchaikovsky a dream is a wish and so this is love are standouts the characters are also a delight cinderella is idealistic and strong and the mice provided great comic relief the stepsisters were also well done as well as lucifer but i loved the stepmother the best she was really evil in comparison to a great character in the name of the fairy godmother it is true the movie drags slightly with the antics of the mice but they were genuinely funny so i dont care i dont think it is overrated underrated dont you mean it rarely plays on television but the really bad sequel does on cinemagic on a regular basis if you want a great cinderella adaptation try the wonderful ever after or the lavish slipper and the rose which isnt as good but whatever you do avoid the sequel which i have the mistake of owning because youll thank me 910 bethany cox
6,found this one in the video store and rented it its one of those quirky quasicomedies thats more interesting and weird than funny its a good one at that it reminds me a lot of being john malkovich if you enjoyed that movie you will most likely enjoy this one
4,you know when youre on the bus and someone decides to tell you their lifestory and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is slap the fool and walk off well i had a similar sensation while watching this film okay i did actually choose to go and see aprile and i knew about nanni morettis taste for making himself the one and only star from caro diario but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs i wanted to give moretti the madre of all slaps caro diario was funny unusual and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways in aprile however moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a highpitched whine going on about how his politics are best or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment he also finds time to slag off films that he doesnt like something i thought was reserved for losers like me surely being in a position like his youd think hed try and make a point about cinema a little more intelligently than this by making a proper film perhaps one with some ideas and a decent structure or maybe one that isnt completely dominated by his annoying voice and when he started fawning over his newborn baby i just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal preferably not a selfobsessed film director with a strange penchant for tacky music the next time someone you dont know tries to tell you their lifestory give them a slap from me every blow will be a small victory in the fight against morettiism
5,one of the most unheralded great works of animation though it makes the most sophisticated use of the cutout method of animation a la south park the real talent behind twice upon a time are the vocal characterizations with lorenzo musics carlton from tvs rhoda woody allenish ralphtheallpurposeanimal being the centerpiece the accidental nightmare sequence is doubtless one of the best pieces of animation ever filmed
5,this movie is similar to the play entitled blithe spirit written by noel coward the plot of a ghost wife and a medium are strongly linked to cowards writing im surprised that movies of this nature dont acknowledge the original writers concept i realize that the public may not be aware that this is a knockoff but it isbr br sad these movies are so expensive to produce i do perk up when a screenplay is original i even perk up when its an innovative way to produce a work that was previously released there were some samples mentioned such as topper etc br br i realize that movies are still a comparatively affordable form of entertainment however im not please when the publics taste is taken for granted in this situation the publics taste is overlookedbr br i look forward to better produced movie entertainmentbr br in this case i rather see the play
7,as a former kalamazoo resident with a fondness for the town i was looking forward to seeing this movie but what a disappointment although the acting and the production values arent bad the script is awful the plot is unrealistic and the theme is disturbingbr br the main message of this film is that women are nothing without husbands and children i can hardly believe how regressive it is in its view of women has the writer been living under a rock br br although i enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen i wouldnt suggest this movie to anyone its terrible its an embarrassment to the city its named after
0,well made and stylish while still ultimately making sense this thriller would work better for non giallo fans to get interested in the genre than the later argento entries which go overboard in all directionsbr br for fans of these crazed italian thrillers they will appreciate george hilton and the turns his character takes and what hes put through the camerawork is fresh with dashes of graphic violence and odd but appropriate choices and a good not overblown music score as well the less you know about the story the better to make it workbr br the only thing lacking in keeping this from being a great sergio martino directed giallo is that the story doesnt have that extra sexual or psychological or both element to put it over the top its more a routine mystery the characters are well defined but live or die according to the plot not according to their own virtues and flawsbr br the recent dvd 2005 release is beautiful looking and definitely the way to see the film unless these ever get art house screenings which seems unlikely
1,the saddest part of this is the fact that these are 87 minutes ill never get back i knew this was terrible from the getgo with the guy dressed as a lunatic indian chief on top of the roof see if they could get away with that in 2008 my 10yearold boy is really into baseball right now so we decided to rent it on a rainy day even though he seemed to enjoy parts of it i had to cringe when i heard all the needless foul language bad bad movie this was an awful ripoff of bad news bears completely shameless and completely predictable i dont mind a predictable movie if its done well but this one absolutely was not
0,born raised and educated in scotland i was appalled at this disgusting portrayal of a man who was no more nor less than a cattle rustler worse yet the thread of the entire movie was sex in one form or another by implication or verbally to view it one would think that 18th century scotland was populated by a bunch of sex perverts and homosexuals lange was a joke acting as the young mother at age 49 but liam neeson was even worse taking a bath in a scottish loch is not commonplace as they portrayed him  but it did give them yet another opportunity to demonstrate how sexually driven we were save your money and watch pinnochio
5,the release of tarzan the ape man in 1932 caused a sensation it may be hard to believe 70 years later but the film had much of the same kind of impact as the matrix or the lord of the rings has achieved at a time when movies and radio were the major sources of entertainment tarzan became an instant pop icon the noble savage that every woman fantasized about and every man wished he could be the only person unhappy about the situation was edgar rice burroughs who while hed agreed to mgms creative liberties and enjoyed his hefty royalty checks felt the dumbed down version of his character with no plans to allow him to grow was unfaithful to his vision he would start a production company and soon be making his own tarzan films mgm realizing the value of its newest star knew the sequel would have to be even more spectacular than the originaland tarzan and his mate deliveredbr br the film had an interesting back story cedric gibbons mgms legendary art director had gotten a commitment from the studio to direct the sequel prior to the release of tarzan the ape man despite the fact that hed never directed before the studio hadnt anticipated the films impact and didnt think a novice director would matter much on a novelty filmand they wanted to keep their oscarwinning department chief happy gibbons a prodigiously talented and imaginative visual artist loved the freedom of precode hollywood and decided to have tarzan and his mate push the envelope to the limittarzan and jane would frolic in a nude swim and jane would appear topless through most of the film maureen osullivan said in an interview shortly before her death in 1998 that while a double was used for the swim she trusted the studio and did a couple of days of filming sans topbut it became too much of a headache trying to strategically place plants and fruit to block her nipples and the idea was abandoned the film shot those days would be worth a fortune she did do a nude silhouette scene in a tent flashed her breasts at the conclusion of her swim and donned a revised jungle costume that was extremely provocative very thin and open at the sidesand the resulting outcry would help create the hays office and the selfcensorship that would soon engulf the entire industrybr br mgm yanked gibbons from the production the official reason given was his workload as art director and veteran jack conway was listed as the new director to appease the criticsalthough james c mckay actually directed the film as conway was busy on other projects including viva villabr br the film incorporated the best elements of the original safaris murderous tribes tarzan fighting jungle beasts to the death to save jane and actually improved on the storytelling harry holt neil hamilton from the first film returns to africa for ivory from the elephants graveyard and to try to seduce jane into returning to england with gifts of silk dresses underwear and perfume he brings with him martin arlington paul cavanagh a crack shot and inveterate womanizer who sneers at holts chivalrous pursuit of jane and stalks her as a potential conquest to be had by any means including killing tarzan if and when he can get away with it without being seenbr br tarzan barely tolerates the intrusion into his happy life with jane and puts his foot down refusing to allow the hunters into the graveyard arlington finds his opportunity catching the ape man alone and shoots him then returns to the camp with a fabricated story of his demise now jane has no reason to remain in the jungle and she can direct them to the graveyard before her long voyage back to england comforted by the ohsosympathetic arlington but a savage tribe and hideous torture await the groupcan tarzan being nursed back to health by his ape family recover in time to save janebr br while stock footage is again used extensively the racial stereotypes of the 30s are apparent and the gorillas are obviously actors in ape suits tarzan and his mate achieves a level of sophistication unsurpassed in any other tarzan film as well as a sexiness that even bo dereks blatantly erotic tarzan the ape man couldnt touch johnny weissmuller was in peak condition physically maureen osullivan was never more beautiful and africa never looked more romantic and dangerousbr br tarzan and his mate was a triumph although it would be drastically edited for many years and remains the classic of the series to this day
0,im always surprised about how many times youll see something about world war on the german national television you would think they dont like to open old wounds but there isnt a week that goes by without a documentary or a movie about the horror and atrocities of this war perhaps its a way of dealing with their past i dont know but you sure cant blame them of ignoring what happened and it has to be said most of those documentaries are really worth a watch because they never try to gloss over the truth and the same can be said about their movies think for instance about der untergang or the downfall as you might now it which are also very realisticbr br one of those movies is rosenstrasse it tells a true story and deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the war even though the movie starts with a family in the usa at the present day after hannahs father died her mother all a sudden turned into an orthodox jew even though she hasnt been very religious before she doesnt know where the strange behavior of her mother comes from but as she starts digging in her mothers troubled childhood hannah understands how little she has ever known about her mothers pastbr br the fact that this movie deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the nazi regime is already quite surprising for as far as i know there hasnt been another movie that deals with this subject for those who didnt know this yet being married to a socalled pure aryian man or woman meant for many jews that they werent immediately sent to one of the concentration camps but that they had to work in a factory but it does not only tell something about the problems of the mixed marriages it also gives a good idea of how these people were often seen by their own parents and relatives how difficult it sometimes was for them during the nazi regime and how these people most of the time women did everything within their power to free their men once they were captured and locked away in for instance the rosenstrassebr br the acting is really good and the story is very well written although the way it was presented in the beginning didnt really do it for me and thats exactly the only part that youll get to see in the trailer perhaps its just me but i would have left out a big part of what happens in the present day at least of the part that is situated in the usa because the part where hannah goes to berlin and talks to someone who knows more about her mothers past definitely worksbr br if you are interested in everything that has something to do with the second world war and if you arent necessarily looking for a lot of action shots than this is definitely a movie you should see this isnt a movie in which youll see any battles or gunfights but it certainly is an interesting movie because it gives you an idea about an aspect of the war only little is known of i give it an 810
5,this was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isnt that great sure chaos and inside man are literally the same movie just with variations in suspense but i found chaos more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film swordfish the reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the states and chaos was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters but has yet to find a distributor in the uk and usa br br its true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like dog day afternoon and other spike lee films but that doesnt mean that it is a pleasant film to watch br br watch it if nothing else is on tv but youll probably get bored with after awhile
5,as an aging rocker this movie mentions heep and quo  my favourite bands ever  but with the incredible cast everyone  and the fantastic storyline  i just love this piece of creative genius i cannot recommend it more highly  and mick jones added so much foreigner lead and primary songwriter along with the greatest rock singer ever  lou gramm  i have watched this great work more than 10 times bill nighy  what a voice  and jimmy nail  talent oozes from every pore  then astrid and karen what more could an aging rocker ask for 1010  bloody brilliantbr br alastair perth western oz originally from windsor england
2,one of those el cheapo action adventures of the early 1980s that used to fill video rental stores solely to be taken out by adolescent boys in the hope of a cheap thrillbr br woeful down market attempt to cash in on the death wish phenomenon by substituting a moderately attractive woman for the visually challenging bronson acting is terrible sets are cheap the baddies are well bad identification with any of the characters is unlikelybr br only redeeming feature is modest amount of gratuitous female nudity a smattering of which is full frontal other than that you can leave it
1,when it first came out this work by the meysels brothers was much criticized and even judged to be exploitation luckily it is now hailed as a masterpiece of documentary cinema especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in what is reality television and the bad evolution of most direct cinemabr br really at first we must say that this isnt really direct cinema it is more cinema verit the difference between the two is very slight but it mainly is the fact that in this documentary we are made to feel the presence of the meysels brothers and they do interact with the characters filmed this as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation the meysels have been allowed in the house and they are included in what is a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household and both edith and edie just love the idea of being filmedbr br it would have been very disappointing had very been shown only a voice of god narration and shallow interviews here we are given a full portrait of the madness of the house a madness that does seem to go down well with both edie and her mother edith their house is a mess litter and animals everywhere faded colors and furniture all over the house and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality these two people have lived with each other their whole life and are not fighting in front of the camera because they want the attention but rather because they cant help talking to each other this way they know each other too well to hide their inner feelings there is no need in the end though even as they blame each other for their lives they really love each other deeply edie says she doesnt want her mother to die because she loves her very much and edith says that she doesnt want edie to leave her because she doesnt want to be alonebr br but the most interesting aspect of the film is that regardless of their old age the two women cant help be girls they cannot help being one the singer the other the dancer exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera when edie asks david meysels rhetorically where have you been all my life she is really very happy that she finally gets to show the whole world herself and her wonderful showgirls skills a beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a charm that is highly unlikely to be ever seen again the way only the meysels and few others could do
2,van damme what else can i say bill goldberg there we go now we know this movie is going to be really horriblebr br i saw the first five minutes of this movie on tbs knowing it would be bad but not even i thought it would be this bad the plot is awful van damme is getting old finally but unlike arnold his movies are as wellbr br forget this movie dont see it ever i wouldnt even be paid to see this filmbr br 15 stars  at its heart lies a wonderful actionpacked thrill ridebr br  well maybe not but the marketers would sure like us to think so wouldnt theybr br john ulmer
4,i could never stand watching happy days after chachi joined the cast so i knew i was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured scott baio a skateboard chase scene jodie foster in her first grownup role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no excuse for this boring mess two hours out of my life that ill never get back no noteworthy characters unbelievable storyline questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all i couldnt have cared less the story of california teens in the 1970s where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots dont waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie
5,the minute i started watching this i realised that i was watching a quality production so i was not surprised to find that the screenplay was written by andrew davis and was produced by sue birtwhistle both of these brought us the excellent 1995 production of pride and prejudice so my only gripe here is that emma did not run to or or maybe even six episodes like pride and prejudice the acting was superb with i think prunella scales excellent as miss bates but i loved kate beckinsale and mark strong just as much the language is a delight to listen to can you imagine in this day and age having a right go at someone without actually uttering a swear word samantha morton was excellent as miss smith in fact the casting was spot on much as it was with pride and prejudice i liked it so much that i watched it twice in two days so once again thank you bbc for another quality piece of television i have seen the paltrow version and it is okay but i do think the bbc version is far superior an excellent production that i am very happy to own on dvd
7,but i got over it to me it seemed that even the author of the book favored caroline i felt so sorry for the character louise and she was constantly compared with esau who was evil i just felt the comparison was a bit harsh and unrealistic really though the movie was bad i wouldnt really see it unless youre ready for a big let down
6,the screenwriter poorly attempted to recreate the exorcist but put in some blahblah love story that makes you sick instead of keeping you engaged there is no substance whatsoever in this entire film it had the potential of being something special but blows it by showing a bunch of people yack about things nobody cares about extremely boring i wanted to leave the theater when i saw this but the dumb movie tickets were expensive so i had to withstand the dreary torture which felt like it lasted forever nothing on screen connected relevance back to whatever the characters were talking aboutbr br they use computer graphics in here that instead of wowing me as it intended i hate cgi just ruined the movie even more some people say this movie did horrible in the movie theaters because of how thoughtprovoking and slowpacedwithoutactionbecause its an intelligent film it was what is so intelligent or thought provoking when the story is basically about pretty boy heath ledger as a priest who has a love interest and disobeys his religion seems like an uninspired concept oh and theres some mumbo jumbo about the sineater movie was originally going to be titled sineater lame concept but the movie took the sineater thing too seriously making the movie become pathetic and delusional about how dark and intelligent it was yeah i know there were really sineaters in the medieval times but this movie just makes it sound cheesybr br nothing in the movie was executed right and i forget why i even bothered to see this movie if you want horror films that actually have depth watch rosemarys baby the tenant naked blood society cannibal holocaust pin exorcist omen or any of the romero dead trilogy films nonsense dialogue does not equate to intelligence people mainstream movie fans think that though same kind of people that think a ridiculous movie like hulk is a cinematic masterpiece if you want mindnumbingly boring horror watch the order this movie makes church seem like a roller coaster ride
7,this was playing at our theater in amsterdam and the film we wanted to see was soldout so we went to this not knowing anything about it other than it was a documentary about the planet we were very happy at our misfortune as this was a very powerful film about life and the delicate balance we all share with the rest of the inhabitants of earth this film has some of the most breathtaking photography i have ever seen in a film and took me places from deserts to oceans to rain forests and displayed things i have never seen in a film tv or book earth is a film that every student should see before they become jaded i will encourage my niece to see this film since she will be inheriting the planet we leave her this is also a film to see on a theater screen or a very big television since the photography is so powerful and exotic
5,i saw this movie a couple years back i couldnt sleep and there was nothing on so i peeped it what really gets me is it makes no sense and thats why its disturbing richard gets tied up in chicken wire and jarvis starts making out with richards girl while shes unconscious then jarviss buddy troubador is playing some stupid song on his guitar by the next morning it shows richards girl talking to jarvis and trouby and then she walks back to richard and looks at him while hes still tied up then they play some happy music and the movie is finished i mean what happened did they brake up and what was she saying to those guystrouby and jarvis its to puzzling and to poor to i cant stand movies that are disturbing and dont make sense this was the worst film ive ever seen since the 90s version of lord of the flies
6,citizen x is the superbly told true story of the hunt for one of historys worst serial killers what makes this story even more compelling is where and when it took place the soviet union in the 1980sbr br  mild spoilers br br  viktor burakov magnificently played by stephen rea is a newly promoted forensic investigator for the rostov oblast militia he discovers past and present unsolved murders apparently by the same person the murders are unsolved because no one has ever taken the trouble to properly investigate the evidence he is driven to find and stop the killer his only tools are his dedication skill and honesty his obstacles are the corruption and political ideology of the soviet system that discourages the search for truth his naivet would have led to failure were it not for his boss col mikhail fetisov donald sutherland fetisov is a politically astute cynic who understands the game and knows how to deal with the soviet bureaucracy however he also shares burakovs desire to bring a murderer to justice even if the official party line is there are no serial killers in the soviet unionbr br  the cast is outstanding the locations and sets are perfect recreations of latter day soviet life randy edelmans score is particularly goodbr br  more important this film shows a dark and disturbing criminal phenomenon with both intensity and poignancy this was a madeforcable movie by hbo films and they have become a great resource for films that would otherwise never be made
0,that was great fun i never read those chestergouldcomics but its not necessary to know them maybe there were some inside jokes i didnt figure out but what the eye doesnt see the heart cannot grieve over this is such an ironic colourful film and the actors are goodhumoured all together the setting is similar to that in the batman movies but not as dark and grey okay the story is not so original but there is a plot which is not selfevident and a more or less surprising endingbr br with this movie you could play an interesting game if you watch it with friends dont watch the credits at the beginning and then look whos the fastest to find out who are the famous actors under their makeup
6,i love this movie 10 out of 10 hands down it is that damn good i am not much of a fan of movies but i gotta tell you this one opened my eyes astounding color and fast energy i was fortunate to catch this at a screening during the zoinks film festival in boston and the story really enveloped me from the start it had a lot of adult themes and character and when it ended i wanted more i hope they make a sequel that would be fun my only problem with it is the performance of melissa connor as anya ugh she sucks ive seen a block of wood pull out a better performance i dont what the director was thinking when he cast her but if you ignore her you cant help but give this movie a big ten
0,theres a certain allure ive always found in discovering the great semi unknown film these discoveries have nearly always been dramatic films  in my experience unknown scifi action and horror are unknown for very very good reasons i found high tide on video at a junk store mixed in amongst countless dozens of tapes of varying quality of course thats the only place i would find it as it is still not on dvdbr br while i was watching judy davis as lillie throughout the course of this film i was somehow certain i was watching a great undiscovered performance yes i had previously seen davis in several small parts  and one starring role in a passage to india but although she was superb in the aforementioned film high tide is a different animal entirely since recently watching gillian armstrongs later film charlotte gray i was acutely aware of the sort of actress which impresses her davis draws much more than a passing resemblance to cate blanchett  in both manner and sensibilitybr br judy davis performance is stunning i cannot say enough good things about it she shares an amazing onscreen relationship with young claudia karvan as ally this films other great actress theres a lot of drama and quiet humanity they share together the details of which i wont presume to reveal here see it for yourself theres too much good in high tide to cover in one review indeed i would hardly care to  the film speaks well enough for itself in conclusion i would like to praise screenwriter laura jones for her stunning dialogue director gillian armstrong for her understanding of actors and the great russell boyd for his brilliant understated cinematography please see his work in tender mercies
5,whether you watch the regular version of this monstrosity or the mst3k version you can only be impressed by the utter gall that went into this production the filmmakers insult the viewers intelligence from one end to the other and obviously couldnt care less that they are doing sobr br everything about it is rockbottom cheap even the 1950s car in the flashback sequence to that era looks like it was hauled out of a junkyardbr br the hobgoblins are as you probably know realized with badlycrafted hand puppets and stuffed toys when a person is supposed to be attacked by them its clear the toy is being held by the victim to his or her own body when the critters scurry away from the two security guards this is shown or rather not shown by the camera aiming up at the guards as they look down and turn their heads as if watching the hobgoblins scurrying past its reminiscent of the scene in the film tangents where two people are standing in the ruins of a future world surveying the wreckage and we arent shown any of it budget constraints alloyed with utter incompetence generally mean you wont have anything worth showing so why try the sets were utterly laughable club scum was an obvious diner the house appears to have been a vacant house probably for rent or sale which the production company got hold of for an hour or two to do the shoot the spacecraft is something i would have been ashamed to build when i was a modelmaking 10 yearoldbr br the motivations of the characters make no sense kevin gets denigrated by his worthless ingrate of a girlfriend because he hasnt made her proud of him im sure this was intended to make their reconciliation oh so touching at the end but any guy with real selfrespect would have told her to go to hell and left her nick is supposedly back from months of army training yeah nice regulation haircut nick and seems bent on proving that our country is being defended by sadistic moronic animals who are sex maniacs kyle is a phonesex freak in red shorts who dreams of a night with a spandexclad dominatrix type but hes so effeminate that hes more likely gay than not one of the girls is a prude and the other is a sleazebr br and the hobgoblins at the end they all head back to the vault where theyve lived for 30 years why who knows who cares watch this film and be amazed at how primitive filmmaking in our modern age can be when you have an idiotic script incompetent direction actors who are so bad theyd be rejected from a high school theater production and sets worthy of edward d wood jr

0,this film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments i loved the character of matt and also tiny they seemed the most engaging and funny characters and certainly the most interesting matt is very good as is his no good cousin and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy i must say i saw striking similarities between matt and another aussie actor eric bana my personal favourite part was the brothel scene loved that overall i liked the film and itll get about an rating the penalty however i was disappointed in it was a side foot curl rather than the appropriate laces blastbr br i am of course kidding 
7,oh my how can they make movies of such beauty but that are so terribly bad i mean even uwe boll doesnt make crap like this there is not even a hint of a decent story multilayered characters or attraction its just a random sequence of pointless chatter joined together to make a movie i suppose only children up to years of age could enjoy it given the world is so utterly dimensionless and the story so incoherent that anyone older would be annoyed by it but then again its far too scary for anyone under years of age that theres probably no one that should watch this movie at allbr br take my advice and stay far far away from this movie your little daughter can make a better storyline and though she probably isnt able to draw pictures this pretty her tales are much more worth listening to and please in the name of whoever you believe in do not expose your children to this piece of  ill give it out of 10 and thats exclusively for the graphics because the story and character development are so awful theyd deserve a negative ratingbr br and if you decide to watch it anyways remember that i warned you
2,you have to figure that when the stars name is listed wrong in the opening credits you are not in for a good time the credit reads cuba gooding jr some nice car chase shoot em up blow em up action if all you want is action because the relationship to what plot exists is tenuous at best and completely unbelievable the motivations of the characters especially that of goodings at the end are worse then unbelievable they are irrational when they are not hopelessly muddled all i can think is that andy cheng must be a really nice guy to get this many good actors into this foul a project he cant have something on all of them can he

1,i gave this film stars only because dominic monaghan actually put effort through in his acting everything else about this film is extremely amateur everything associated with the direction of this film was very poorly executed not only should the director rethink what she is doing for a life career but maybe she should watch a few films as dominic monaghan is a very credible actor placing him in a film of this caliber makes him look awful whomever the actor was that played jacks best friend should never have stepped in front of the camera i didnt expect much from such a small film but perhaps a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their surroundings dont waste your time or money on this film like i did you will be sorely disappointed

7,the bubble is an effort to make a gay romeo  juliet type of story with an israeli and a palestinian although it seems to come at it by way of friends or beverly hills 90210 the characters are shallow and trite as are the dialog and plot line the movie seems torn between fluff and depth on the one hand there is a pointed effort at being shallow as in one example of many some minor characters even ask questions that invite development of insight into the conflicts at hand and get answers like hey were here to make a poster for a rave against the occupation dont get political beyond the obvious absurdity of such a line its just one of many hamfisted signals that the movie is just as hollow and insubstantial as its title suggests on the other hand the movies main pretension to depth follows the lovers to a presentation of bent a play about gays in a nazi labor camp the scene on stage is awkwardly rushed undermining its erotic power understandable given the constraints of filmtime but still this could have been edited to much better effect and comes off as flimsily as the rest of the film too bad this play deserves much betterbr br the characters are so onedimensionally cartoony some even have names that telegraph their entire though the word seems inappropriate here substance the aggressive soldier from the crack golani brigade is named golan the militant palestinian is named jihad the strivingforchic faghag roommate is lulu anyone familiar with the checkpoints and life in palestine whether from real life or documentaries will find the checkpoint scenes as absurdly unreal as well the rest of this fluffy fantasy when a palestinian woman goes into the fastest labor on record israeli soldiers are solicitous and helpful an ambulance shows up in minutes the outcome of the birth serves to show the palestinians as unappreciative of israeli beneficence and even downright paranoiac altogether the checkpoint is shown as a mere nuisance not the series of bonenumbing soulcrushing humiliating obstructions with no regard for medical care or necessity in cases of birth death or severe illness ashraf the palestinian lover seems to get through from nablus to tel aviv with no problems no papers no hassles he just shows up whenever he likes when the israelis want to get through it is much more of a challenge involving a scheme worthy of lucy ricardobr br against the backdrop of nice supportive israelis and surly homophobic palestinians we move to a resolution that is utterly lacking in motivation or purpose  except as a painfully obvious dramatic device to milk sympathy for the forbidden loversbr br gay israelipalestinian romance has been handled on stage with much more skill and depth as in saleems salaamshalom so this film is hardly even as groundbreaking as some people would like to thinkbr br gloriously bad films  like the works of ed wood  at least have some striking idiosyncrasy to distinguish them this one doesnt even have that going for it most of the sound track sounds like simon and garfunkel on quaaludes and even with the weird oedipal touches to the gay sex scenes the general incompetence that pervades this movie plays out like a mediocre tvmovieoftheweek
5,i am as many are a fan of tony scott films when this movie came out i had high hopes that it would be like man on fire to find out that the movie its the furthest thing from it the story was treading water from the get go and the choice of mickey rourke was not such such a good idea and the whole armscene was too gratuitous br br the movie is centered around kiera kinghtly and this movie reveals that shell never become a movie star the movie brought some of the worst acting everbr br i like tony scotts direction n all but this takes the whole friggin cake sorry ton out of 10
0,whats good about it some inventive and genuinely creepy little effects that will get under the skin of even the most seasoned horror fan doesnt rely on the hackneyed soundtrack stabs for its gotcha moments even if youve seen everything theres still a few things in this film that will make your jaw dropbr br what could have been better about it the acting was at times flat and unconvincing it had a shotonvideo quality in some places thoughit mostly achieved the atmosphere it was striving for and the camera work is full of needless closeups of meaningless actions though the effects are genuinely creepy i think they may have gone to the well a few too many times with some of them the ending seemed rushed and glossed over what could have been more impactful moments the viewer is left to figure out a lot of things for themselves not as a challenge by the filmmakers but because they just missed itbr br still a good little indie horror film that is easily several steps above the average well worth the rental
7,when i got this movie free from my job along with three other similar movies i watched then with very low expectations now this movie isnt bad per se you get what you pay for it is a tale of love betrayal lies sex scandal everything you want in a movie definitely not a hollywood blockbuster but for cheap thrills it is not that bad i would probably never watch this movie again in a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time or you would see it on a sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time despite the bad acting clich lines and sub par camera work i didnt have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my dvd player the story has been done many times in many movies this one is no different no better no worse br br just your average movie
7,director  writer michael winners feature is a better than expected offbeat supernatural horror film although still schlock efficiently catered for which really does by go unnoticed sure it might borrow ideas from other similar themed horror movies of this period but still manages to bring its own psychological imprint to the smokescreen material of good vs evil and a unique vision that has a fair share of impressively expansive if somewhat exploitative setpieces as a whole its sketchy however remains intriguing by instilling an ominous charge without going gangbusters with the scares actually theres always something going on amongst its busy framework but its rather downplayed with its shocks steering to soapy patterns and atmospheric tailoring up until its vividly repellent and grisly climax with a downbeat revelation winners dressed up craftsmanship might feel pedestrian however its the ensemble cast that really holds it together as you try to spot the faces theres plenty too some having more to do with the scheme of things than others but theres no doubts every one of them are committed despite the ludicrously crude nature of it all its interesting to see names like sylvia miles whos significantly creepy beverly dangelo likewise deborah raffin eli wallach christopher walken william hickey a neat cameo jeff goldblum jerry orbach and tom berenger in bit parts then you got a mildmannered chris sarandon and movingly gorgeous cristina raines in the leads offering able support jos ferrer martin balsam ava gardner john carradine burgess meredith and arthur kennedy the script does throw around many characters as well as notions but gets disjointedly sidetrack by trying to squeeze all of it in however its disorienting air works in its favour in establishing the suspicion and deception of whats really going on here is there a reason for all of this and why is it surrounding raines character the emphasis is mainly built upon that moody angle as it begins to slowly shed light of her inner goings and that of the strangeworrying experiences she encounters when shes moves into her new apartment this is where winner tries to pull out the eerie shades which projects some icy moments gil melle was the man responsible for the grand overpowering orchestral score that never misses a cue and richard c kratina instruments the sweeping scopelike photography
6,just saw this movie and what a waste of time the movie was predictable and slow its basically the mormon bad news bears that play church sanctioned basketball rather than watching this movie i should have had a root canal the cameo performances were obviously driven by sponsorship  funding this movie had potential due to the outrageous behavior that is exhibited by mormons when they play church sanctioned basketball however because its rated pg the true nature of the spectacle could not be transfered to film the acting is horrible with the exception of clint howard and fred willard thurl baileys appearance in the film was completely unnecessary
1,kenneth branagh shows off his excellent skill in both acting and writing in this deep and thought provoking interpretation of shakespeares most classic and wellwritten tragedy kenneth plays the role of hamlet with such a distinct emotion that provokes tears kate winslets performance is also of great note
7,weve been served  a terrible filmbr br okay ill admit that since im white and have had no practical experience in the competitive world of stepdancing i might not exactly be an authority on this type of film on the other hand i do know a bad motion picture when i see itbr br and boy have i just seen itbr br filmed in lowbudgetvision and directed by ian iqubal rashid a touch of pink how she move tells the tale of how important it is to follow ones dreams  even if those dreams include bopping around to loud irritating hiphop music and speaking dialogue the average person would not understand if he or she had an international translatorbr br ill try to give a small synopsis of the plot first of all there are two actors that look like ll cool j who work in an auto shop in toronto the mecca of racial diversity but still have time to practice dancing for eight hours a day br br there are a few other guys in this crew including a token white dude and a guy that looks like denzel washington in malcolm x there are also two women in the movie  one resembles serena williams and the other looks like geraldine from the old flip wilson show one of these ladies was kicked out of a private college because her parents spent all of her tuition on a drugaddicted sibling the other girl a member of salt n pepa no doubt is just plain no goodbr br theres another guy who looks like eddie murphys buckwheat while still another actor whos a huggy bear knockoff these guys are rival step dancers evidently this activity is very hardcore in the hood and they are all practicing for the big step monster jam in detroitbr br since i was unable to understand 90 percent of the dialogue perhaps some subtitles would have been useful as in a bergman film or that one music video by snow its hard to explain what happens other than theres a lot of arguing the serena williams girl who never smiles by the way becomes a freelance stepper moving from group to group theres some stepdancing and a lot of irritating hiphop musicbr br its a typical ragstoriches story sort of like rocky with a really bad soundtrack rudy with annoying rap music in the background cry freedom without the laughs br br but why does a film  which could have made a big impact on black audiences  have to contain drug addiction bad parents and a title that sounds like a firstgrader saying the phrase how she movesbr br i was moved by this movie however moved to leave the theater as quickly as possible
3,ok for starters taxi driver is amazing this this is not taxi driver or amazing what it is is bad but i thought it was bad funny which means that it did have some redeeming qualities like the dialoguewow there was more or less no plot the characters were all stupid and the movie was preachy there were some places were i thought the movie would dive into taxi driver type violence which would have hit the message at the end of the movie on the head much harder i cant even believe that there are like 20 other people who have seen this movie yeah its worth watching if you are real bored and you want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can make a movie or at least can try to
5,i just finished a marathon of this series and it became agonising to watch as it progressed from the fictionalising of the historical elements to oherlihys awful accent in later episodes the show just slumps the further it goes if you are looking for some low quality production generalised ww2 fluff then i could recommend season but avoid anything after that it degenerates into being one step from a soap opera with increasingly worse story lines and sensibilitybr br the old bw film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the colditz name attached to it and even that is not what one could hope for
1,this was a disappointing film for me it came to me via a boxed set entitled classic film noir which was a gift from someone who knows i typically enjoy films done in that style i insist that noir is a style not a genre i do not think it is a noir film at all there seems to be a tendency these days to label and market every black and white b movie made from 1947 to 1955 as noir and the label does not always fit there is a persecuted male protagonist ed cullen lee j cobb and most of the films action takes place indoors those are just about the only noir elements that i could see there is no pervasive paranoia or any real reason why one should sympathize with ed cullen jane wyatt was overdressed and unconvincing as a femme fatale i do not want to spoil this film for potential viewers however i would be interested in hearing what other connoisseurs of film noir have to say about it
7,and that comes from someone that will withstand almost any viewing the acting and sound is awful this might qualify for a so bad its good point of meritfor some however i take my horror movies seriously and this is just crapits just soooo cheap i think thats my major complaint the dialogue is often hilariousattention to how many times you startled me is used the child actress is seriously god awfuli pray her acting career ended hereher line donuts i hate donuts is worth repeated viewing however
4,after apprehending the man responsible for the murder of his boss deputy sheriff thomas jefferson geronimo iii is assigned the task of taking the killer back to italy on the way however the plane is diverted to malta not long after landing the killer escapes now and with little help from the maltese police deputy sheriff geronimo is out to recapture a murderer but will his shoot first take names later brand of texas justice work in a foreign country br br let me get this out right up front ive seen final justice both with and without the mystery science theater 3000 commentary ive seen the scenes that were cut that help make the movie a more coherent whole and ive seen the cutup tv version that was used for mst3k having said that ive got to admit that i much prefer the mst3k version why because final justice is one lousy movie the mst3k commentary helps make it much more palatable on its own its a real snoozer of an action movie with corny dialogue often delivered with such thick italian accents that its impossible to understand bad acting weak direction gigantic plot holes and most everything else youll find in a bad movie and if most of final justice wasnt so bad its good it would be one terribly dull movie on top of everything else so yes i enjoy the often very funny mst3k commentary over the bad movie on its ownbr br my main sticking points with the mst3k commentary and with most of the reviews ive read on final justice however involve the criticisms of joe don baker the main weaknesses in bakers performance actually have nothing to do with his size or the wardrobe choices of his character or any of the other jokes flung in his direction instead i think much of it is has to do with the poor decision to cast him in the lead in the first place joe don baker has always struck me as a decent enough actor but hes not the kind of guy i would call an action hero by any stretch of the imagination hes more of a sidekick as he demonstrated with solid performances in a couple of james bond movies or if you really want to blame someone for the problems with final justice point your finger at director greydon clark clarks resume cant begin to compare with bakers so i say lay off joe don baker
0,i got hooked on this as apparently abc has licensed this show to pearl tv in hong kong it caught be my surprise as it was a break from listening to anything chinese but i started getting reeled in as the cast and the story lines are just nyc enough and thoughtful nothing too unbelievable though i think its very very stereotypical of them to write damien as a potential black man with a sheet that has been the most disappointing aspect the rest is great and im sad to learn on imdb that i cant look forward to watching season when i get back to the us im am just as disappointed as the other commentators that this showed much promise and quality and taste but just as shows that show characters getting closer its probably harder for people to watch if the start watching several episodes in which is apparently a bit too late for the eager networks
7,this is the who at their most powerful although before the masterwork whos next which would provide anthems like baba oreily and wont get fooled again this film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the 70sbr br daltrey shows what being a frontman is all about entwistle steady as ever br br moon is great check out the ongoing conversation with the drum tech and see him playing side saddle whilst having a bass drum head replacedbr br townsend even looks like hes enjoying himself occasionallybr br considering they took to the stage at 2am no one in the crowd was asleep br br there are not many bands these days could produce a set as tight as this and it is difficult to imagine any of the bands of today producing a concert that in 36 years time will be be enjoyed as much as this one
2,i read all the reviews here after watching this piece of cinematic garbage and it took me at least pages to find out that somebody else didnt think that this appallingly unfunny montage wasnt the acme of humour in the 70s or indeed in any other era if this isnt the least funny set of sketch comedy ive ever seen itll do till it comes along half of the skits had already been done and infinitely better by acts such as monty python and woody allen if i was to say that a nice piece of animation that lasts about 90 seconds is the highlight of this film it would still not get close to summing up just how mindless and drivelridden this waste of 75 minutes is seminal comedy only in the world where seminal really does mean semen scatological humour only in a world where scat is actually feces precursor jokes only if by that we mean that this is a handbook of how not to do comedy tits and bums and the odd beaver niceif you are a pubescent boy with at least one hand free and havent found out that playboy exists give it a break because it was the early 70s no way there had been sketch comedy going back at least ten years prior the only way i could even forgive this film even being made is if it was at gunpoint retro hardly sketches about clowns subtly perverting children may be cutting edge in some circles and it could actually have been funny but it just comes off as really quite sad what kept me going throughout the entire 75 minutes sheer belief that they may have saved a genuinely funny skit for the end i gave the film a because there was no lower scoreand i can only recommend it to insomniacs or coma patientsor perhaps people suffering from lockjawtheir jaws would finally drop open in disbelief
6,i was pleased to see that she had black hair ive been a fan for about 30 years now and have been disgusted at the two earlier attempts to film the storiesbr br i was pleased that the screenwriters updated the period to include a computer it didnt spoil it at all in fact i watched the film twice in one day a sure sign that it was up to standard this is what i do with books that i like as wellbr br i thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of modesty blaise extremely well as evinced in both book and comic strip i would also have to disagree with a comment made by an earlier reviewer about baddies having to be ugly has he actually read the booksbr br i thought this was a very good film and look forward to sequels with anticipation
5,i really wanted to like this western being a fan of the genre and a fan of buffalo bill wild bill hickok and calamity jane all of whom are in this story add to the mix gary cooper as the lead actor and it sounded great br br the trouble wasit wasnt i found myself looking at my watch just 40 minutes into this being bored to death jean arthurs character was somewhat annoying and james ellison just did not look like nor act like buffalo bill cooper wasnt at his best either sounding too wooden this was several years before he hit his prime as an actorbr br in a nutshell his western shot blanks head up the pass and watch another oater because most of em were far better than this one
6,and even then even they can live without seeing it to be honest this film if one deigns to call it that is of real interest only to bondage freaks bettie page fans will learn absolutely nothing new and i do mean nothing nor will they enjoy the warm fuzzies of experiencing anything familiar loved or cherishedbr br nevermind the abysmal screenplay the wooden lessthancommunitytheater acting the utter absence of direction the crappy lighting or any of the rest of the bargain basement production values this is definitely hey kids lets make a movie moviemaking of the lowest order i suppose one could be thankful that at least they knew how to run the camera no im sorry to say that none of that is germane to why this thing is so outright wrongbr br its wrong because the young lady playing bettie page a somewhat zaftig girl whose only resemblance to the queen of curves is dark hair and the trademark bangs utterly fails to bring anything to the role beyond a willingness to be bound and gagged this is apparently a good thing for her film career before and since this wretched excess but not for the wretched excess itself which consists primarily of a number of lovingly reenacted bd setpieces sandwiched between horrendously awful fauxbiographical scenes delineating ms pages fall from grace so to speak theres actually probably more information per se about pages life in the opening and closing credits than the rest of the moviebr br do not be fooled this is not a worthy companion film to the notorious bettie page this is not a worthy film at all this is a fetish piece that trades on the allure of one of the greatest pinups of all time and does it without class without style and without any real sense of understanding the character of bettie page whatsoever no true bettie page fan will find it to be anything but a disappointment i guarantee thatbr br avoid at all costs if free remember that time is money too yours may not be worth much but im betting its worth enough that youll be sorry you wasted time with this one thats it im done youve been warned
1,this was a superb episode one of the best of both seasons down right horror for a change with a story that is way way above the average moh episodes if there is such a thing a mans wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car wreck in which he was driving his airbag worked hers didnt she is burned beyond recognition great makeup btw and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin graft but even in a coma she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology and when she does die for a few minutes her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit carnage of course ensues and also some extremely gory killings and also some extremely sexy scenes what more could you ask for you might ask well not much because this baby has it all and a very satirical ending that should leave a smile on most viewers faces i just loved rob schmidts wrong turn direction too he has a great knack for horror excellent episode this is one im buying for sure

5,the beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mothers love the exceptional performances the steady execution and the quite innovative script the film tells the story of an indian woman nandini who lives in canada with her husband shekhar and little kid raja all of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in india of whom she had not even known is in troubles and the couple rush to india when they get into the village nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture shekhars family ruled by his cruel highly cynical and merciless father narasimha lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless nandini starts nagging shekhar to return home but he is soon killed by his fathers enemies when she wants to leave narasimha refuses to let her take raja back to india here starts the intense struggle which can be called nandini vs narasimhabr br india is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas so it may be even correct the portrayal is in my view fair and not onesided because the positive side is also presented to an extent such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world the locations are amazing the music is wonderful and krishna vamshis direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing one thing that must be noted is the very earpleasing background score by ismail darbar it is beautiful the characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film portrayed realistically throughout the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch its dialogues are superb and intelligently written and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tensionbr br the films biggest strength is the performances karisma kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as nandini her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible she displays so much intensity impulsiveness anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son her outbreaks while facing off nana patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child after fiza this is her most powerful performance one of the greatest actors indian cinema has seen nana patekar is indescribable as narasimha he manages to be hateful as narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him patekar displays cruelty wittiness and even humanity with total conviction he is outstanding another great performance comes unsurprisingly from indias most underrated actress deepti naval who sensitises her character to perfection sanjay kapoor is just adequate and shahrukh khan provides great comic relief anyway do watch shakti  it could have been better but it is definitely a mustwatch
5,this is by far the worst horrorthriller ive seen in my 29 years if someone offers this to you for free tell them no this movie makes you a dumber person for knowing you watched it the plot isnt even the worst part of this movieits the acting camera work lighting and sound there is absolutely nothing to like about this movie whoever paid to have this film made is broke now i hope the director never gets the greenlight for another movie in its defense this movie was made quickly to try to capitalize on the actual btk killers capture but ive seen movie of the weeks that looked like oscar winners compared to this
7,im not even sure what to say about this film its one of only a handful of movies ever made that i would consider romantic to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank zappa like dancing about architecture it absolutely hits the nail right on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie adaptation wanted to write the ending is left open and ambiguous no happy ending here just mystery no profound life lessons just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings romantic lovebr br 10 out of 10 watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger
6,what about dahmers childhood the double hernia operation which is believed to have sparked off his obsession with the inner workings of the human body what about infinity land  the game he invented as a child which involved stick men being annihilated when they came too close to one another suggesting that intimacy was the ultimate danger what about the relationship between his parents and the emotional problems of his mother that were far more relevant than just his own relationship with his father his feelings of neglect when his brother was born what about his fascination with insects and animals how he would dissect roadkill and hang it up in the woods behind his homewhat about focusing more on his cannibalism and what about his parents divorce these are all things that should have been included in the film instead the film maker chose to give us a watered down snapshot from a night or two in his life and combine it with series of confusing and at times unnecessary flashbacks to events that werent even particularly relevant to our understanding of dahmerbr br why didnt the film maker show how dahmer was interested in people as objects rather than people he could have made this point many times particularly in the scenes in which he drugs his victims whilst he has sex with them which actually took place in a health club not a night club instead he just shows him ramming away at them from behindbr br whilst i appreciate there is only so much information you can cram into 90 minutes or however long but why spend such a large part of the film examining his relationship with luis pinet known as rodney in this film my only guess is that the director was trying to build up pinets character to try and make us fear for or empathise with him but this film is supposed to be about jeffrey dahmer so why couldnt he have spend those forty five minutes on something else if the scene and their relationship was important enough to warrant such time then fair enough but it wasnt the scene in which he kills steven hicks his first victim is a vital part of the jeffrey dahmer story because it was the first killing and because of the effect that killing had on the rest of his life unfortunately the film doesnt explain that it was his first killing or that he didnt kill again for nine years we assume because his hair style is different and he is wearing glasses that this is a flashback but to when and why br br what about the shrine he made in his sitting room towards the end of his careerone of the most important clues we have towards understanding dahmer and his motivationsbr br some people may find my need for accuracy in fact and detail a bit anal but having studied jeffrey dahmer in depth it is plain to see that this film has very little in common with the person he was and the crimes he committed why bother to spend the time making a film loosely based on jeffrey dahmer rather than tackle the real issues behind his descent into madness and the carnage that ensuedbr br finally a film with subject matter as repellent as this should carry an 18 certificate not a 15 we needed to see his perversion in more depth to understand just how detached he was from the rest of us that doesnt mean showing the drill actually entering konerak sinthasomphones head for instance but at least an indication of the amount of people he killed and what his modus operandi was when actually killing anyone watching this film who doesnt know the story of dahmer might come away thinking he had only killed a few people he actually killed seventeen menbr br aside from the facts and lack of depth the film isnt all bad there is some nice cinematography and good performances from the two main characters id like to see this done again by a film maker who has more knowledge more energy and a better reason for making the film in the first place
4,i watch most movies that nick mancuso is in because frankly i love the guy even though as he ages he is typically cast as the baddie longtime fans should note that he is for some reason blond in this flick its a fairly familiar movie in terms of plot but then most movies these days arent exactly original but rick roberts is appealing as the imperfect husband martha macisaac is equally appealing as the daughter and mitzi kapture does a good job if that was her goal of being angry and sometimes pretty hard to like nick has still got it in terms of being able to demonstrate both charm and psychosis however too much of the plot takes place offscreen  like motivation prior behaviors good times and bad times  and things that seem apparent to the characters never quite make it to the audience ie me the final scene leaves everything to be desired in the but what about category and overall i cant say that i cared much about any of the characters that being said it was what it was  a reasonably entertaining way to spend the afternoon  and i still like nick
1,this movie has some of the worst acting that i have ever seen some scenes are original such as the nails coming through the floor this nail trap catches these bad guys the rest of the movie degrades as you go i cant believe that this movie is not even in the bottom 100 movies of all time i also cant believe that there are sequels the next crap movie that i want to watch is rotor could rotor really be much worse than thisbr br 
0,i was excited to discover this late sixties comedy staring some of my favorite people  maggie smith a very young bob newhart and of course peter ustinov my disappointment was thus compounded to discover the film doesnt work as either a comedy or a perfect heist film ustinov plays a small time crook just out of prison who sets his sites on a large american corporation based in london bluffing his way past dimwitted ceo karl malden and tech geek newhart ustinov passes himself off as a computer expert and immediately plans the perfect heist part of the film to do this he needs to get passed a tamper proof security system that guards the corporation mainframe and here is problem one his perfect plan only works because everyone else in the film is remarkably trusting and stupid his lame excuses are taken at face value and this must be the only computer center anywhere not to bother with video cameras the second problem is the heist fraud really happens within the first 30 minutes of the film robbing the rest of the picture of much in way of dramatic tension maggie smith is sadly miscast as ustinovs ditsy next door neighborsecretary who just cant keep a job i love maggie smith but she just seems too together here too composed the part called for more of a wacky physical comedian furthermore ustinov and smith have no chemistry together maybe its the age difference but the later romantic relationship as devoid of actual romance as it is still comes off a little creepy ustinov cowrote the script and it was thought well of at the time but i found it unfunny meandering and a sad waste of a great cast
5,this film is shoddilymade unoriginal garbage i like romantic comedies sometimes watching a good one is like eating ice cream for dinner its not something you are going to do all the time but the experience is so pleasurable that you can ignore how unwise you are being this movie made me think about how stupid i was for continuing to remain seated for its entire running time everything about it screamed made on the cheap it actually looks like they overexposed the film at certain points it is so washed out it boasts cheesy cgi and lame sets toobr br the writing was clunky i know that you can usually expect some plot problems in a screwball comedy but you usually dont really care because you are laughing this movie is so unfunny that you actually sit there and wonder about the unlikely series of coincidences and completely unbelievable behavior involved events were placed in the film just to move the characters from one scene to the next or to provide exposition sure this is how all movies work but you shouldnt notice that its happening inelegant thats the term i should usebr br there was almost no one in the movie who was really likable i didnt care who ended up with whom as long as they all stayed the hell away from me and i didnt have to listen to them talk about it anymore why would the only really cool character in the movie the paul rudd character want to have anything to do with the completely bitchy condescending control freak played by eva longoria also almost all of the characters involved consistently picked the sleaziest solution to any situation a straight man pretends to be gay for five years just to hang out and bathe with with a woman he is attracted to the best feelgood moment they could come up with was to tack on a happy ending for the same schmoe where he gets together with rudds equally annoying lying kleptomaniac sister lake bell and eva longoria are very attractive appealing women maybe they will find something better to appear in down the road
2,a very tired looking burt reynolds plays a mercenary battling his former employers for some gizmo these nonheroes plan to sell to the iranians lowrent video nonsense by the producers of silk stalkings offers some decent action footage and a lot of ineptly staged dramaa lack of logic and truly dreadful dialogue are the defining aspects although the final twists and allegiance shifts couldve been a nifty end to a better movie burt still has presence although it also means you notice more when he mouths insultingly halfbaked oneliners
2,this anime is a mustsee for fans of evangelion its an earlier work of anno hideaki but his unrestrained dramatic style is quite in place also those who didnt like evangelion might find this release to bit slightly more palatable gunbuster is rather unique to scifi anime in that its actually based on real science in fact the show has several little science lesson interludes explaining the physics behind some of the events in the movie one of the big dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds near that of light the series does a wonderful job of dealing with the imaginably traumatic experience of leaving earth on a six month mission traveling near the speed of light and returning to an earth where ten years have passed the main character remains age 17 or 18 throughout the entire series while almost all of the other characters age considerably be warned this show is heavy on the sap at times it also has a couple of the most wholly unmerited breast shots that i have ever seen i found it fairly easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boohoo scenes because the series is otherwise very good but viewers with a low sap tolerance might want to stay away from this one on an interesting note gainax as always managed to run out of money in the last couple of episodes however they managed to use black and white film and still action sketches to produce a good resolution anyway the ending is a bit silly but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut i couldnt help but love it gunbuster is in my opinion one of the finest pieces of anime around
2,ive seen a lot of crap in my day but goodness hot rod takes the cake i saw a free screening in ny the other night i can only hope they show the funny version to the paying customers the big laughs were sparse the plot was uninteresting and the characters were one dimensional at best one highlight is a hilarious dancing scene with adam samberg it was priceless and was the only scene i truly had a hearty laugh at other than that i can only recollect randomness and dead air snl  samberg fans may be disappointed i know i was expecting more from it but it short i definitely would not recommend attending a free screening or paying to watch this film
2,the man who directed the third man also directed the who will buy sequence in oliver now that is talentbr br i raise my hat to carol reedbr br i know there are second units involved but still br br and he had to deal with orson welles and oliver reed br br i suppose quality will outbr br it does show in the final scene with nancy  avoiding spoiler  everyone has to see oliver for the first time sometime  how many lines do i need to typebr br encouraging people to type too much is not to be encouragedbr br i hope this counts as the 10th line
2,spoilers with a gathering of family members and servants of the late christopher dean john carradine to hear his last will and testament they get somewhat of a surprise in that the dean fortune some 140 million dollars the money is to be divided between them but only after they successfully spend a week at the dean mansion there seemed to have been a mixup in the story when we later find out that its really an overnight sleepover not a weeks vacation at the mansion for the guests to qualify for deans money since almost everyone ends up dead by sunrisebr br the first victim of the dean curse have nothing at all to do with getting and money from the departed christopher dean estate the local sheriff dan garcia rodolfo acosta acosta has his head chopped off refrigerated and then served on a platter to a shocked group of guests later that evening cute little chin greg and laurasjeff morrow  marry anderslittle pet pooch is found dead outside floating in the pondbr br the movie has all the people staying at the dean mansion being picked off one by one until its revealed who the killer really is we then have what seems to be a doubletwist in the story where the original killer is suddenly killed together with two of the last remaining guest the real killer ends up not only getting all the loot 140 million dollars but then ends up not having to split it with his accomplice by doing him or her in by giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spotbr br nonsensical who done it and haunted house movie with a cast of such immoral and unlikable characters that even a mother much less the audience would have trouble liking theres everything you can possibly think of in the move involving the selective guests that includes incest sm sadism and of course doubledealing and backstabbing not even counting murder you just couldnt care less who of the guests survives to collect the dean fortune at the end of the movie hoping against all hope then none of them dobr br even the big surprise at the end isnt really that much of a surprise since the killers identity is divulged with the filmmaker having forgotten to keep his face in the shadows so you actual see who he is even before he reveals himself we then have a plottwist that eliminates the killer together with a number of remaining guest just to make the movie a little more confusing then it already is the final plottwist that you can see coming from as far as ten miles away was just to show how smart the very obvious killer was which fooled almost nobody watching the movie
4,ok i saw this in the theaters when it came out and i dont know why i havent seen it since but i ended up on this page because i found myself thinking about this film  again i dont know why but the fact that i remember it speaks volumesbr br comedy is hard  much harder than any drama doing it right makes it seem easy but doing it wrong  is there anything worse than a bad comedy steve martin pay attention you are falling in this category again for some reasonbr br elvira mistress of the dark must have done it right for me to remember this movie fondly done at a quick pace with tongue in cheek and knowing it isnt the philedelphia story it entertains from start to finish brain donors is another that fits right in this category sans most of the gratuitous boob jokesbr br one point of contention  the ending it seems the writersdirector had no idea how to finish a comedy the ending tries to be a love story somewhat undermining the quirky fastpaced dialogue up to that point then there is the tassle scene whereas this has to be seen male opinion it is so over the top and out of place its like a shock one more rewrite for the ending was neededbr br this is not comedy genius like spinal tap or the producers or the holy grail but if you dont try to dissect it and just let the puns and sappy fun come to you youll laugh i guarantee it
4,watched this last night and was bowled over by the heartfelt story line the excellent character development and the good karmic vibe emanating from the acting and movie as a wholebr br without giving away too much of the plot it begins with an ordinary joe who commutes to his office job every day who becomes inspired to take dance lessons along the way the protagonist and the assorted characters he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves br br the story has a prologue about what dancing in japan symbolizes sociologically so it isnt exactly as simple to learn to dance in japan as it is here in the us br br the film is lighthearted youll laugh out loud at some of the sight gags yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe all of the films characters are taken seriously as they are and none are diminished because of their imperfectionsbr br ive been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends it just so happened a friend lent me the video on learning to dance is this synchronous or what i think so because now im really geeked to give it a try br br watch this wonderful family film small children might not get it but teens certainly would and smile at the genuine caring you see shown in it time and againbr br why they would make a remake of shall we dance is a mystery as it is perfect asis
7,what is supposed to be a simple generic mystery plot involving a dead philanthropist is in fact a headache inducing tale about a bunch of characters the only big actor being ginger rogers in a very early role all trying to find the murderer among a small cast of residents in a posh apartment building these characters range from utterly stupid to downright mean as a cheap low budget production most of the action revolves around rogers and her lead man some guy i dont care who he is cause he really sucked talking about their various possibilities of solving the crime while being constantly cut off by an absurd detective with his head in his butt honestly ive never had a worse time watching an old brate movie of this type and ive seen some real headslappersbr br oh and the butler didnt do it because there wasnt a butler but pay attention to the guy whos closest to a butler there ya gobr br polarisdib

0,this documentary is incredibly thoughtprovoking bringing you in to the lives of two longtime lovers who are in the final stages of aids the past footage of their twentysomeodd years together really brings their final moments homebr br if this movie doesnt make you feel the pain and agony of these two fascinating people you dont have a heart
6,ill probably get a lot of flack for hating this movie guess i didnt approach it with the proper dewyeyed nostalgia of the generation before me but suffice it to say st elmos fire was pretty crapfreaking tastic even as far as brat pack films gobr br here is yet another lovely example of the smug selfindulgent neurosis that is everything 80s rent anyone the plot is virtually non existent and the philosophies are kitchy at best poorly delivered the rest of the time the complete lack of anything resembling sympathetic characters doesnt help the situation there really was no growth no forward movement at all even the climactic suicide scene was effectually neutered by once again refusing to let death or anything resembling reality or adult life enter in br br each cookie cutter figure simply goes about making you hate them in the blandest most predictable way possible the stalker is a creep for no discernible reason other than he is a stalker and andie macdowell is gorgeous the jackass does everything in his power to constantly remind you he is well a jackass the gorgeous slut hides really soulful deep pain with a wild lifestyle the poet moods and mopes around for a full 34 of the film until he can reveal  he actually is full of teddy bears and sunshine and rainbows the virgin finally becomes a whole happy human being after getting every virgins desire of one hot roll in the sack with a jackass before he ditches her to really change for real this time the cheating bastard cheats until it is time for him to get caught and finally the feminist go around dousing holy water on any soul that utters commitmentbr br which brings me to my final beef what bond of supercement was holding these people together as friends i cant imagine being with just one of them now think of the vortex created by all that narcissism centered in one bar and they were all so terrible to each other heads in toilets near rape and sleeping around with everrrryone the cherry was after two bffs act like total baboons after screwing the feminist shes like umm actually i dont want to be with either of you anymore lets be friends and we can hang out in a totally unawkward way every day knowing that i may hook up with one or the other at any given point but neither of you are satisfying enough for commitment not that word and they all smile as if to say golly gee i never thought of that what a great ideabr br only its not kinda in the way that watching this movie is not

4,the more i analyze this film the worse it becomes first of all why a motivational speaker that part was just stupid i mean why would a megalomaniac trying to control the world rely on a motivational speaker is alexander stone really that disorganized first he cant decide what he wants to do to control the world so he looks to the bible for ideas many of these ideas i might add really have no reliabilityfor example the part of the the houses of ishmael and isaac shall scream out in terror could have already happened it could have been have been the synagogues burned during krystalnacht and the mosques could very well have been the mosques blown up in baghdad or something and gillen lanes family they had no part except to provide a family values platfrom and dab their eyes with water i might add that since casper van diengillen lane is only in his twentiesor thats the impression that i hadand has a ten year child he had his child during high school yeah there goes tbns family values also why did this film have to be so damn propagandalike ill repeat what an earlier reviewer said the indiana jones flicks use christian mythology as a plot dvice and manipulate it well so that we are intoxicated this film doesnt do that the beginnig starts off well with michael ironsides playing a priest who murders a scholar off some sort and steals the dead guys omega code then when confronted by two men who he is obviously afraid of the two prophets tell him tell your master that we are here dominicironsides replies he already knows and points to a small surveillance camera that part sent chills up my spine had only it gone on like that one scene i would have loved this film ill give michael york credit he does a fine job of acting out his character as does michael ironsides but the good guys are horrible ive already went on about lanes familybr br  now that im over the acting ill get on to plot this is obviously a baptist film since our beloved pope of the vatican is portrayed as an oaf the world domination plot i liked and found plausible and subtle as were the action sequences were also thrilling and welldone also another diatribe against the vatican their leaders are seen as dogmatically minded since gillen explains to the pope that its not the end of the world but the beginning of a new one also the vatican or israelissays their going to secede from the world union aince they used the omega code to control the world whoever it was they wouldnt just secede theyd send over commandoes and kill them this is the equivalent of america knowing about the kgb going to kill the president and simply saying were not going to talk to you any more come on i did enjoy the scenes where we see bombers headed towards israel and see them again on the monitor mediocre in short
0,more eeriness and dark secrets released in the final parts of lars von triers fantastic horror satire the kingdom much more is revealed and the ending just leaves you begging for more plus a great performance from udo kier in a more substantial role
1,greetings again from the darkness what ever happened to the great barry levinson he directed two of my alltime favorites in avalon and diner he had some fine movies as well rainman but always provided something of interest  until now i believe the worst thing you can ever say about a comedy is that it is boring envy is the definition of boring never of big fan of pure slap stick dumb and dumber i was just stunned at how godawful this movie is there are maybe chuckles in the whole thing  if you can pay attention that long the best part of the film is the running gag of the title song by a redbone soundalike if the film had been written as well as the song it would have been tolerable rachel weisz is a wonderful actress and i realize they all want to do comedy even julianne moore but the real world exposes one weaknesses snl cast member amy poehler is her usual over the top in her role as trailer park trash turned princess the disaster of the film is jack black and ben stiller the first work commute together flashes some promise but after that their chemistry disappears due to the poor script this script is like most of jack blacks characters ideas  not a bad thought but no hope for success
6,no mention if ann rivers siddons adapted the material for the house next door from her 1970s novel of the same title or someone else did it this lifetimelike movie was directed by canadian director jeff woolnough having read the book a long time ago we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television you know that when the critical moments precede the commercials which of course one cant find in this version we watchedbr br the films star is lara flynn boyle who sports a new look that threw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through from the new eyebrows to other parts of her body ms boyle is hardly recognizable as col kennedy the character at the center of the mystery this was not one of the actress better moments in front of the camera that goes for the rest of the mainly canadian actors that deserved betterbr br the film has a feeling of a cross between desperate houswives with the stepford wives and other better known features combined with a mild dose of creepiness the best thing about the movie was the house which serves as the setting
5,this film had a lot of promise and the plot was relatively interesting however the actors director and editors seriously let this film downbr br i feel bad for the writers it could have been good the acting is wooden very few of the characters are believablebr br who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film there are lots of quick flashy edits in almost every scene which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoyingbr br i wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no it left me feeling like id wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money
5,i remember back when i was little when i was away at camp and we would campout under the stars there was always someone there that would have a good story to tell that involved the woods that surrounded us and they would always creep me out well when i found wendigo at the library i checked it out hoping to be one of those films that had a supernatural being haunting people in the woods much like the stories that were told at camp well much to my dismay i was so far from the truth wendigo is really bad the story starts of when a family of three is driving to their winter cabin which looks like your normal suburban home and nothing like a cabin in the woods and they run into a deer well it seems the local rednecks were actually hunting this particular deer and are pretty upset at our city folk the movie spends far too much time following the families everyday activities instead of getting to the point of the film it wasnt until about the last 15 minutes that we actually have some action involving the wendigo my suggestion is that you stay very far away this film it will leave you wanting your hour and a half back
4,i didnt know what to expect from the film well now i know this was a truly awful film the screenplay directing and acting were equally bad the story was silly and stupid the director could have made a smart and thought provoking film but he didnt i squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad where was the focus to the film where was anything in this film christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it it was shabbily done and a waste of my money do not see this film
0,first a little summary this reporter named torch is basically trying to get out the story of a zombie outbreak and finds the military  government censoring him nice message government censorship and all that but the way they did the movie was well let me explainbr br this movie is beyond description the idea that somebody holds it in higher regard than anything by george romero is justification enough for the reviewer to be committed to a mental institution the script is atrocious on its own like it was written by a sixth graderas for special effects i understand that independent films have low budgets and some gore effects looked acceptable but if you want a scene with fire heres a tip buy some nonflammable material have an extinguisher ready and get a fire going dont digitally add it in and make it look like an explosion from a nintendo 64 game the acting well lets put it this way in my summer theater program a cold reading of the script is compared to this the godfather i wont even go into the inconsistencies find them yourselfbr br what disturbed me the most though was when everything was finished after shooting and editing somebody might have said okay this looks good lets release it it sends a chill down my spine to even think about it to think somebody felt that this was good enough for dvd release this isnt dvd quality this isnt scifi channel quality hell this isnt even film school quality if you were to submit this in for a project at a film school you would get an f no not even an f more like an f i wouldnt be surprised if he would try to get you expelledbr br i felt used after i saw this thing blockbuster and the makers of this movie have my money right now and id prefer not to think of what theyre doing with it i have been the pawn of some elaborate nefarious scheme at legalized theft and it doesnt feel good to think that i walked right into it looking at the back cover with pleasant memories of 28 days later only to find a film ed wood would watch and say afterwards i didnt much care for this this film is the single most terrible movie i have seen i have not seen anything by ed wood but i have confidence this is worse if you are looking for serious cinema so much as being within ten feet of it will probably give you a bad headache if not i still recommend that you personally write the director and ask how he sleeps at night however if you are the kind of person who get a laugh out of really bad stuff then i recommend you check this out you wont be disappointed
0,it could have been a better film it does drag at points and the central story shifts from boyer completing his mission to boyer avenging wanda hendrixs death but graham greene is an author who is really hard to spoil his stories are all morality tales due to his own considerations of catholicism guilt and innocence very relative terms in his world view and the human conditionbr br boyer is luis denard a wellknown concert pianist who has sided with the republicans in the spanish civil war he has been sent to england to try to carry through an arms purchase deal that is desperately needed unfortunately for denard he is literally on his own  everyone of his contacts turns out to be a willing turncoat for the falagists of spain in particular katina paxinou mrs melendez a grim boarding house keeper and peter lorre mr contreras a teacher of an esperanto type international language wanda hendrix is the drudge of a girl else who works for mrs melendez the local diplomat licata victor francken is already a willing associate of the falangistsbr br the brits holmes herbert miles mander and best  if not worst  of the lot george coulouris dont give much hope to boyers cause which he soon grasps may be britains before long herbert and mander just retreat behind the official policy of neutrality ordered by the ramsay macdonalds and stanley baldwins governments during the civil war coulouris here is a typical col blimp type  always impeccable in his native english diction he is sharp in showing his dislike for foreigners in generalbr br the one ray of hope is lauren bacall rose cullen here trying to play her role as well as she can  but she cant really shes an aristocrat  the daughter of a press lord it was bacalls second film and sad to say almost sank her long career she does act well but the spark she showed in her first film was due to the dual effect of starring with humphrey bogart and being directed by howard hawks boyer is a fine actor but hes not bogie and herman shumlin is not hawks her next film returned her to bogie and hawks again and her star resumed its ascendancybr br its a bleak film as was the novel boyers mission never succeeds as he has too many hidden foes all over the place but the villains are likewise also losers  frequently with their livesbr br with dan seymour as a suspicious foreign tenant of katina paxinou and the man who destroys her it is well worth watching to catch the warners lot of character actors doing their best given the weakness in direction
0,i love midnight cowboy and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine what is interesting to me is how when midnight cowboy came out in 1969 it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated x of course at that time x meant maturity since i was only two years old at the time of the movies release it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then however when i try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film which included prostitution the title itself was slang for a male prostitute homosexuality loneliness physical and to some extent emotional as well abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day i can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release it is worth noting that in the 1970s midnight cowboy was downgraded to an r rating and even though it is still rated r some of the scenes could almost be rated pg13 by todays standardsbr br i want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie jon voight plays a young man named joe buck from texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in new york city escorting rich women he emulates cowboy actors like roy rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women after being rejected by all the women he has come across he meets a sleazy conman named enrico ratso rizzo who is played by dustin hoffman ratso convinces joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager once again joe is conned and before long is homeless however joe comes across ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment without giving away much more of the plot i want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with joe and ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams ie joe making it as a gigolo and ratso going down to florida where he thinks he can regain his healthbr br i want to make some comments about the movie itself first of all the acting is excellent especially the leads although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end there are some classic scenes in fact there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny i find them amusing for example there is the classic scene where dustin hoffman and jon voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over dustin hoffman bangs on the cab and says hey im walkin here im walkin here i get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of new york city where so many people are in a hurry another scene that comes to mind is the scene where ratso dustin hoffman sends joe jon voight to a guy named odaniel what is amusing is that at first we think odaniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that odaniel is nothing but a religious nut in addition to the two scenes i mentioned i love the scene where ratso and joe are arguing in their apartment when ratso says to joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and joe says in selfdefense john wayne you gonna tell me hes a fag what i like is the delivery in that scenebr br i would say that even though midnight cowboy was set in the late 60s much of it rings true today thats because although the area around 42nd street in new york has been cleaned up in the form of disneyfication in the last several years homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was 40 years ago also many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the jon voight character one thing that impresses me about jon voights character is how he is a survivor and i felt that at the end of the movie he had matured a great deal and that ratso dustin hoffmans character was a good influence on himbr br in conclusion i want to say that i suggest that when watching this movie one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on for example there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings also what i find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with joe buck jon voights character and the people who were in his life in texas even the ending while i dont want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie is rather openended
4,along with its partner this is the greatest piece of animation ever created the images and styles are amazing and match perfectly with the story which is a brilliantly realistic reinterpretation of our own world where is has been and where it could go quite affecting and sometimes painful to watch it it a masterpiece of the visual art
2,as much as i dislike saying me too in response to other comments  its completely true that the first 30 minutes of this film have nothing whatsoever to do with the endless dirge that comprises the following 90br br having been banned somewhere doesnt make a film watchable just because it doesnt resemble a hollywood product does not make it crediblebr br worse yet in addition to no discernible plot other than there are lots of muddy places in russia and many people even very old women drink lots of vodka a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating im in to my second package of rolaidsbr br as for spoilers  well the film is so devoid of any narrative thread i couldnt write one if i triedbr br dont waste your time or money and dont confuse this with good russian cinema
7,handsome and dashing british airline pilot george taylor a solid portrayal by guiseppe pambieri gets beat up by thugs after a wild night in hong kong george meets and falls in love with the sweet and virginal dr emy wong a fine and charming performance by the lovely chai lee george regains his health and goes back to work when emy fails to hear from george for a lengthy amount of time she succumbs to despair and becomes a prostitute while directorcowriter bitto albertini does indeed deliver a satisfying amount of the expected tasty nudity and steamy softcore sex this film is anything but your routine wallow in leering sleaze instead its a surprisingly thoughtful touching and tragic love story between two well drawn and highly appealing characters chai as emy wong is especially radiant and endearing the picture starts out bubbly and cheerful but the tone radically shifts into a more grim and harsh mood about two thirds of the way through emys descent into vice after she falsely assumes that george has abandoned her is bleak and upsetting ditto the remarkably sad and heartbreaking surprise bummer ending granted the narrative is certainly melodramatic but never too silly or trashy moreover the sex scenes are quite tasteful and even genuinely erotic notorious italian porn star ilona staller has a nice sizable supporting part as georges jealous and uninhibited secretary helen miller guido mancoris polished cinematography offers many strikingly gorgeous shots of the exotic locations nico fidencos funky throbbing score hits the groovy spot worth a look for those seeking something different
5,this has long been one of my favourite adaptations of an austen novel although it is definitely not in the same category as the spectacular pride and prejudice emma is a lush and relatively faithful tv version of austens novel  especially considering its short length the biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good one as the unnecessary snobbishness that austen exhibits at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with someone much more akin to emmas character in the rest of the book i thought the characters chosen to portray the roles were wellpicked kate beckinsale walks the fine line between girlishness and the social snob with a grace completely lost in gwyneth paltrows 96 version samantha mortons wispy blonde locks suit her attitude and character as the simper that accompanies her role in previous characterisations is replaced with the harriet we know from the book mister knightlys role is carried out extremely well in my opinion both the seriousness and the gentle compassion that the hero is painted with in the novel are present here in this muchneglected sumptuous film
7,with title like this you know you get pretty much lot of junk acting bad script bad director bad grammar badbr br movie make lot of noise that really not music and lot of people yell movie make bad racial stereotype why come every movie with black hero have drug addict why come hero always have to dance to be success why come famous rapper always have to be in dance movie why come letter s cant be in titlebr br hollywood need to stop dumb down audience and make movie that have people with brain who know how speak proper englishbr br do self favor and not go see
7,be warned this movie tells lots of love stories without any coherencebr br the only intention of this movie seems to be showing love in many different waysbr br each story has only a few minutes so there is no development of characters and nearly no plot just an sketchy idea of a plot the writer tried to build in turning points that aimed to surprise the viewer however that just didnt work out because you didnt get to know the characters in before or these jokes were just sillybr br this is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart a dozen times or even more i dont know and i dont care
7,i am one of jehovahs witnesses and i also work in an acute care medical facility over the years i have seen people die from hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions have attended numerous conferences on blood born pathogens and have seen several patients become seriously ill from pathogens induced by transfused blood i have also heard several jehovahs witnesses being told that they will die if they refuse blood and after 26 years in the field i have never actually seen it happen leaving the question is it really unreasonable to refuse blood transfusions or is the community at large benefiting from the battle on this issue the issue for jehovahs witnesses is a moral one you must abstain from blood is not an ambiguous statement thank you for this movie and allowing comments on it
3,i dont think most people give this movie as much credit as it deserves i love low budget horror movies and this takes the cake especially for originality yes the scarecrow is a kungfu fighting frightner but why not no one else is willing to go that far i really havent had this much fun watching a movie since candyman so the town picks on this one kid calling him scarecrow even his mom doesnt care about him then he gets killed and the spirit is infused with in the scarecrow who then goes on a killing spree his demise is relatively easy to assume once the movie gets going the dedications at the end go straight to a bunch of horror directors but with most dedication towards dario argento really struck me as cool these folks who wanna make movies of a newer genre over the movie has a lot of arnold rip offs with one liners youll definitely laugh at like stick around and he kills the sheriff with a stick i would say grab a pizza some friends an laugh your a off with this movie i love it for its originality most fun
7,ok i watch a lot of bad movies i pride myself on that fact many times there are some gems in the b rated bombs but this movie is one of the worst i have watched i like a good horror moviebut one with a plot of and sense of movement the opening scenes seemed pretty good decent music and imagery then it goes down hill from there one of the main characters has a disability ringing in the ears called tinnitus now this will in turn threaten to reveal his secret they made that too much of a focus of the movie so what he has ringing in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere where that he shouldnt have been no need to keep bringing it up so this guy is having an affair with this girl and in a motel she falls and hits her head on the end table so instead of letting everyone know of his affair he decides to dump the body now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her well after seeing her sister over and over again as a zombie like ghost and even pointing directly to the location of the body she finally finds her now the body is recovered and she is set out to deal with the one and only suspect that killed her bad thing is that she didnt have much of a plan only to pretend to be her twin and met the guy where the body was dumped the idiot didnt even believe he killed her so all is revealed there and even though she had a gunsomehow she manages to get herself strangled so the last scenes of the movie are of the spirits of her and her twin walking out of the water so you mean to tell me in this movie the bad guy wins and not one but two innocent people diebr br good things about the movie imagery br br bad things about the movie music sound effects long and drawn out misdirection of plot low grade acting from some not all actors
6,in a lot of his films citizen kane confidential report touch of evil orson welles gave him the role of an exuberant men in the lady from shanghai its the only time i see him holding the role of the victim the role of the culprit he gave it to rita hayworth i guess its because he was in love with her therefore its an interesting film but i find the story excellent too the direction is genius as usual with welles  two scenes are particularly brilliant the one in the aquarium and the final one with the mirrors this film is brilliant1010
1,as it is generally knownanthology films dont fare very well with american audiences i guess they prefer one standard plot line new yorki love you is the second phase of a series of anthology films dealing with cities  the people who live  love in them the first was parisjtaime which i really enjoyed the film was made up of several segmentseach written andor directed by a different director most of which were frenchbut there is a very funny segment directed by joel  ethan coen like paris this one is also an anthology directed by several different directors fatih akinmira nairnatalie portmanshakher kapuretcand also like parisdeals with new yorkersand why they love the city they live in it features a top notch castfeaturing the likes of natalie portmanshia labeoufchristina ricciorlando bloomethan hawkiand also features such seasoned veterans as james caancloris leachmaneli wallach and julie christie some of the stories really flyand others dont although i suppose it will depend on individual tastesi wont ruin it for anybody else by revealing which ones worked for me  which ones didnt word is that the next entry in the series will be shanghai china is romeitalyberlingermany or athensgreece out of the question spoken mainly in englishbut does have bits of yiddish  russian with english subtitles rated rby the mpaa for strong language  sexual content
1,may contain spoilers a few weeks after i had originally wrote my review for hood of the living dead i realized that i may have been a bit too harsh on this movie which is why i decided i would do something i had never done before review the same movie again dont get me wrong i still dont like the movie i still think its dreck and i still think the zombies dont look all that zombieish the story in the movie is still in my opinion weak and rather lame the story is about a guy named rick who works as a scientist that just happens to be working on a serum thing that heals sick cells in animals and his brother germaine the two arent exactly on the best of terms my my an original plot point and argue a lot one day germaine is shot in a driveby shooting and rick calls up his scientist buddy to bring the serum to try to resuscitate germainewhereas most people wouldve called 911 but whatever naturally the serum fails and germaine dies if that didnt happen thered have been no movie after the police and the coroner until the end of time i will still think that maybe the paramedics shouldve shown up leave the scene shows the coroner van which i still believe was just someones van with a coroner decal thrown on the side and germaine returning to life to attack and kill the paramedics i would talk more about the plot but i feel that if i reveal more about the story you wouldnt want to watch it and we wouldnt want that now would we but suffice to say that the story in my opinion at least meanders and is rather slow moving pun not intended as ive previously said in my review the zombies dont look all that much like zombies i still think they look like theyve been in a bar fight thats not to say that they should all be decaying and whatnot but still there should at least be bite marks on the victims also i still dont like the fact that the directors continually switch up the pace at which the zombies move they couldnt really seem to decide on whether or not to have the zombies run or shamble as most zombie movies do dont get me wrong im all for running zombies but make up your minds people in one scene the zombie runs toward the living and in the other he just shambles to them and sometimes they just dont seem believable yes i know their fictitious creatures but still i am of course referring to the zombie that runs his hand on the wall as though he were walking through a dark living room and i still dont like the zombie who is lying on the ground gets shot then jerks like he was just shot the sound in the movie also bothered me mainly the music which while it may have just been my copy of the film seemed pretty much nonexistent music in a movie is important folks especially when the sound editing does sound like the director just took a friends camcorder and shot a little zombie flick the acting is still atrocious in my opinion and is on par with the american actors from the japanese zombie movie junk the movie is still bad almost house of the dead bad its better no doubt about that but then again thats not saying much its not the worst movie out there and it is better than a lot of direct to video movies that are out there but at the end of the day wasnt good i also think the movie moves really really slow despite the fact that it is only an hour and twenty or so minutes and yes i still dont like the opening song this is the type of movie i think is wellsuited to be premiered on the scifi network which is why i am obligated to give this debacle of a film a one out of ten but think of it this way at least its not a negative one
7,there are so many puns to play on the title of the spectacularly bad valentine that i dont know where to begin i will say this though here is a movie that makes me long for the complexity of the valentine cards we used to give out in elementary school you know the ones with batman exclaiming youre a super crimefighting valentinebr br valentine is a slasher movie without the slightest hint of irony one of the few horror movies in recent years that ignores the influence of scream the villain is omniscient and nighinvulnerable the heroes are easily scared when people run around corners and grab them by the shoulders screaming heyijustleftmycoatbehind the score is more overbearing than norman bates motherbr br the flimsy plot follows several childhood friends now grown up and extremely curvaceous since the film gives them nothing else to do they stand around and wait until a masked stalker kills them one by one this stalker appears to be former nerd jeremy melton who was constantly rejected by women and beaten by men in high school with valentines day approaching the women begin receiving scary cards foretelling their doom melton seems like the obvious suspect only problem is as numerous characters warns in thirteen years melton could have changed his appearance to look buff and handsome so insert terrified gasp here everyone is a suspectbr br heres problem one in order to have any sense of suspense while watching valentine you have to accept a reality in which a high school nerd is capable of becoming david boreanaz nerds dont turn into angel when they grown up they turn into older balder nerds hes not a terrible actor but the script by no less than four writers gives him and the rest of the cast nothing to do but scream and make out denise richards the bustiest actress in hollywood never to star in baywatch is especially exploited most shamefully in the blatant excuse to get her in a bathing suit just before a crucial suspense scene note to self always bring a bathing suit to a valentines day party just because its february doesnt mean you might not feel like taking a little dipbr br the slasher in valentine dresses in headtotoe black with a cherubs mask heres problem number two the filmmakers clearly thought this would be a disturbing image to have on the head of someone whos whacking people in the face with hot irons plain and simple its not instead it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers his entire face including his eyes and ears can move so stealthily without bumping his shins on chairs or tables then again given the things the cupid killer does maybe he can teleport and his eyes are on his hands br br not only is the movie bad it isnt even sure who the killer is the final twist is more huh than hah when youre not scratching your head youre yawning then groaning then searching for the nearest exit do not watch this movie even if youre alone on valentines day find something anything else to do youll be glad you did
0,i am a huge fan of the comic book series but this movie fell way below my expectations i expected a heavy metal 2000 kinda feel to itslow moving bad dialogue lots o bloodbut this was worse than anything i could have imagined br br the plot line is almost the same as the comic but the good points pretty much stop there the characters dont have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series the movie only covers a small portion of the comic and the portion used is more slow and boring than later parts the focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic bookbr br with the right people working on this project it could have been amazing sadly it wasnt that way so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love my copy will surely collect dust for years until i finally throw it out
6,80 minutes and it felt twice that long brief crossing is not brief enough indeed the first 50 minutes or so consist almost entirely of a dialogue more of a monologue really of a woman approaching middle age tediously droning about men disappointment sex aging and her recent breakup to a french teenager she met in the ships cafeteriabr br the tedious monologue continues as they go to dutyfree shop and to a bar where finally her selfinvolved rant pushes him away the story cant end there of course so she persuades him to listen to her drone on more as she brings him to her cabinbr br what little romance sex or for that matter anything at all this film has besides bitter rantings is hardly enough to justify the price of a rental unless you are one of those who love dramas where nothing interesting happens at all yes the ending is very nicely done but it is scant reward to subject yourself to what amounts to a turning your living room into a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic whinerbr br of course some people like it i could be wrong
0,medellin is a fabulous place to live work and study ive been there twice and never did i hear anything about guerrilla activities paramilitaries taking tourists hostage or anything of the sort there are invisible police but it is not a big brother system there are just enough police so that they are visible in everyday life but they do not hassle someone without good reasonsbr br la sierra is an interesting documentary in that the youths it depicts in the movie essentially become its characters the directors of the movie carefully carve out plot lines among the daily actions of the inhabitants of la sierra and when a character dies there is genuine pathos it is difficult to imagine however that the three youths are all members of the bloque metro a gang that used to terrorize la sierra before the colombian government began to restructure the countrybr br la sierra is not an accurate depiction of life in colombia there are of course things to be wary of such as petty crime but when one considers pickpocketing happens in modern cities such as london new york or tokyo colombia doesnt seem that different after all colombians are eagerly awaiting their chance to show to the world that the once wartorn country is now prospering more than ever
1,there was nothing of value in the original movie this one was even lamer the fact that i even found it to rent was absolutely amazing anyone connected to this film has to be high on something so what was the story line what was with the girl was the viewer supposed to get the story line in the first four minutes of the film sadly i tried several times to watch this i even borrowed a kid from someone to get some feedback kid said it was stupid and he was four years old i find that possibly some credit could go to the filming director as possibly some of the shots made the movie more than a b film that might be pushing it i did love the theme song good thing it was only a dollar it was worth it i suppose you might enjoy the film if you were high as the cast and crew would have to be is pot legal in france
3,this may or may not be the worst movie that steve martin has ever made but it certainly was far from his best obviously he did this crap for the pay check dreck like this certainly does nothing to enhance his reputation as a funny man what he doesnt seem to grasp is that when people go to see a steve martin movie they expect to be entertained not bored to tears its sad that he dragged dan aykroyd and phil hartman down with him i dont understand why talented people cant get a grip on the fact that people dont want to see them in lousy movies if youre going to call a movie a comedy then it should be funny this wasnt shame on the us military for allowing itself to be associated with this pabulum too full metal jacket had more laughs than this miserable excuse for a service comedy surely phil silvers is rolling over in his grave
2,i enjoyed a lot watching this movie it has a great direction by the already know bigas luna born in spain and it is precisely in spain that the movie takes place in catalua to be more precisebr br luna explores once more the theme of an obcession in this case the obcession of a young boy for the womens milk there are some psychological concepts in this story such as the rejection complex that the elder son feels with the birth of his brother in the movie this is what leads to the obcession of the young boy who suddenly sees all his mothers milk go to the recently born son so he starts trying to find a breast who is able to feed him he finds it in a woman recently arrived and from here on the movie is all around thisbr br this movie lives a lot on imagery more than the story itself the espectator captures certain moments unforgettable moments and certain symbols the movie deserves a thourough analyses on almost everything that happens because it usually means something the surroundings the landscapes typical from the region as well as the surreal behaviors of the characters also symbolic and the excelent ambiguous soundtrack by nicola piovani transport us to another dimension not parallel to the real world but which intersects it from times to times worth living in that world worth watching this movie even though we may eventually and for moments get tired and a bit sick with the excessive obcession which is perhaps taken beyond the limitsbr br i also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist 810
0,this movies one of my favorites its not really any good but its great to laugh at the dialogue can become incredibly ludicrous and poorly acted eg manji can we ask you a few questions sure we think you can help us with the answers any fighting is more or less surrealistic make sure to watch for brock the oafy white guy who attacks the main characters he only has two lines but hes one of the best guys in the movie
7,mel torme and victor borge in their younger years serve to make this film interesting  and especially viewing a young sinatra on the sunny side of 30 and definitely conveying that this was his yes im a popular singer but hardly an actor yet stage michele morgan is an annoying inane presence and jack haley is an actor whose appeal has always been totally lost on me leon erroll is silly as always but overall pretty funny stars of a potential 10 is about the right grade because with the combination of its positive aspects along with the lack of much of a story and a silly one at that and the forementioned annoyances  it is overall average at best most of the fascination is from the viewing of the three entertainment icons in their early years
6,i saw this movie last night and even after a couple of beers the only giggle this movie got out of me was when i realized that i was actually watching it in a word it is unfunny unfunny i totally believe the trivia tidbit about jack black apologizing for making this garbage i cant believe that barry levinson didnt just toss this script when he read the first page moreover i cant believe that i watched more than ten minutes of itbr br i gave it out of 10 because i love to see christopher walken make terrible movies for the paycheck also the horse corky by merely existing as a character in this movie is actually quite ridiculous
1,gung ho was a good idea however it is to much to ask americans viewers to understand the dynamics of american jobs and foreign competitionin this movie the main character hunt stevensonmichael keaton goes to japan and convinces a japanese auto company to come to america and help his dying pennslyvania town two things come at youfirst why would a japanese company come to america to make cars when they do so and so well at that secondly can anyone understand that american companies of all types go to third world nations to have their products made to escape american labor costs it makes the films premise then that the number one maker of cars in the world would go to one of its top competitorsaside from germanyand put a plant there as unrealistic keaton was still in his comedy mode by this time but he gives a credible performance all the same as he could prove that he could go from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds and still not embarrass himself but director ron howard cant keep this from becoming a tv movie which it ends up being anyway because they have to give the unlikely story a happy ending the politics and problems of japanese and american relations not withstanding gung ho has a happy days and laverne and shirley feel to it as the producers of both tv shows made the film and then made the tv version of this movie as well which gives the film its lightweight feelthe japanese manager gets to love his american workers and feels he and other japanese people can learnfrom americanshis no2 man saito who supposedly doesnt like americans all that much doesnt think soi would have prefered all the japanese characters been like saito than the soft goofball characters they made the japanese out to beit would have made the film more interesting
0,theres no one else watching the movie my husband and i went to watch it last night its just a small theater but theres usually a decent amount of people there not this time my husband and i were the only people watching dragon wars last night now we know whybr br the movie was by far one of the worst ive ever seen yes the cg was good but that was it the acting script  dialog directing editing etc was godawful since we were alone in the room we felt free to talk during the movie that is we talked about how bad it was that it reminded us of the mighty morphin power rangers godzilla mortal combat and the lord of the rings it was like we expected to see rita and lord zed portraying commanders of saurons armybr br the creatures were ridiculous you cant just introduce legions of dinodragonlizard things loaded down with cannons without explanation the lord of the rings has a wide spectrum of characters but it introduces and develops them over movies not in an hour and a halfbr br the scene transitions are horrible i didnt fall asleep during the movie but even though it was an overly simple plot i found myself getting lost in the plot holesbr br the characters were caucasian americans but spoke almost with broken english because of the badly written dialog in the scriptbr br the final scene that could have redeemed some value of the moviefailed ethan didnt cry when sarah diedthough he hadnt known her for very long during this life anyways he didnt seem too upset to be left in mordor not knowing where he was or how to get back we couldnt for the love of god figure out where he was or how he got there either but if he wasnt upset we shouldnt be eitherbr br oh and why did the dress that sarahs spirit was wearing look like she borrowed it from queen elizabeth one more thingall of the main hero characters were reincarnations brought back to finish the job sarah completes her task and moves on to the afterlife jack does this as well then why does ethan get screwed hes left alone without the girl without a mapcompasshelicopter to help him get back whats he supposed to do send smoke signals and if he gets back home does he just go back to his job he should have been given the same mercy of getting killed out of the movie that the other heroes hadbr br dont waste your time or money on this movie we only stayed til the end because wed paid for it but as soon as the credits hit we were out the door
6,whats up with robert pretentious altman was he saving on lighting everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was laughable i mean have you ever seen a lawyers office where everyone works by candlelightbr br dont waste your time in fact dont waste your time with anything altman makes its all a pretentious waste of film
7,there have been very few films i have not been able to sit through i made it through battle field earth no problem but this this is one of the single worst films ever to be made i understand whoopi goldberg tried to get of acting in it i do not blame her i would feel ashamed to have this on a resume i belive it is a rare occasion when almost every gag in a film falls flat on its face well it happens here not to mention the sfx look for the dino with the control cables hanging out of it rear end halfway through the film i was still looking for a plot i never found one save yourself the trouble of renting this and save 90 minutes of your life
2,this is the first out of the guinea pig series and is one of the more infamous films out of the collectionbr br it took me a long time to finally man up and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of films i bought the guinea pig box set and decided to watch the collection in order by release date so i popped this sucker in and sat downbr br from what i had read on the internet and realizing the content involved in this film i was expecting to test my nerves in full force this ended up not being the casebr br the film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin torturing her with the hopes of discovering the human breaking point and how long a human can tolerate painbr br sounds like one sick flick right wrong the film fails to shock this may be because i have become desensitized over the years do to my obsession with horror but i think it is safe to say that any true gorehound could sit through this with easebr br on the other hand an individual who does not have a well knowledge of this type of film will most likely be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen though it failed to shock me the film contains some pretty mean spirited and graphic scenes of violence including the ripping out of fingernails intestines thrown at an unconscious woman and a needle through the eyebr br overall i think for majority of the gorehounds on this board that you should just get your hands on a copy of this film for the novelty of it but i suggest that for any new comers to these type of films that you should work your way up to this one
1,a very good story for a film which if done properly would be quite interesting but where the hell is the ending to this filmbr br in fact what is the point of itbr br the scenes zip through so quick that you felt you were not part of the film emotionally and the feeling of being detached from understanding the storylinebr br the performances of the cast are questionable if not believablebr br did i miss the conclusion somewhere in the film i guess we have to wait for the sequelbr br 
1,ive been a fan of all things bill maher for 15 years but this film was disappointing and at times disgusting of course i am catholic come from a welleducated family and go to church of my own volition which probably puts me at ends with quite a few of bills opinionsbr br bills problem is that he presumes that religion is uniformly negative hes correct to document the sociological aspects of it ie one faith builds its holidays on top of another and that many wars have been started because of religion or more accurately by the sinister appeals of men to the ultimate and unquestionable authority of god but that said he never looks at its positive side quite frankly i think that hell would freeze over before bill would ever humble himself and travel to the slums of calcutta where mother theresa spent her life working with the poorest of the poor shes dead now of course but he could easily visit the jesuit priest in east la who runs homeboy industries which works with young men typically with gang and prison backgrounds to teach them career skills get their tattoos removed and to become responsible members of society or he could visit uscs institute for advanced catholic studies which has brought together some of the worlds finest theologians diplomats and investment bankers to study ways in which to ethically integrate the worlds poorest countries into global capital markets and thereby improve the standard of living for the half of the worlds people who live on less than a day of course he wont do that because that would require him to consider evidence that does not easily fit into his preconceived beliefs about religion and its so much easier to continue to make snide superficial jokesbr br that fits into the other large problem with bills movie which is that he never subjects himself to anyone either on his level or who is better than he is in this movie you have maher the cornell grad spend most of his time talking down to truck drivers at a nondenominational christian truck stop service in a night club with a dutch guy who smokes pot all the time with the minister of a storefront church in miami who claims to be the reincarnation of christ and with an actor playing jesus at a holy land theme parkbr br what you wont see in bills film beyond some superficial speculation alongside a phd in grand central station that religion chemically alters the brain like drugs do and that religion is the fallacy of tradition wrought on the masses is any sort of serious and questioning interviews with philosophy and theology professors from schools like notre dame byu or wheaton college who could easily rhetorically decapitate him in a debate on the matter you wont see any serious discussion of any of the writings of cs lewis gk chesterton or any papal encyclicals and of course you also wont find any discussion whatsoever of any of the nonabrahamic judaism christianity and islam faiths whatsoever all you get at the end of the day is a textbook example of a condescending snobby elitist from the west side of la who makes a movie for his own kind and who has absolutely no gutlevel understanding whatsoever of how the other half of america that elected george w bush twice lives their lives or about the school of thought behind itbr br i get a lot of what bills saying but for someone possessing his intellect and influence this film was nothing less than pathetic anyone interested in the kind of intellectual ferment that indie documentaries typically bring could find more stimulation in an old rerun of the teletubbies
5,this film is absolutely awful but nevertheless it can be hilarious at times although this humor is entirely unintentionalbr br the plot was beyond ridiculous i dont even think a yearold would be convinced by the ludicrous idiocy that the filmmakers tried to slap together into a story however on the positive side some of the horrifically inane plot twists provide a great deal of humor for example wow lady hogbottom has a giant missile hidden in her back yard it gets worse and even funnier but ill spare youbr br the acting is generally laughable most of the kids roles are sort of cute but not very believable on the other hand annie is pretty awful allaround the adults dont take their roles seriously at all but this is largely a good thing if theyd tried to be believable the film wouldve been even worse which is difficult to imaginebr br once you get past the overall crappiness of the movie there are actually a few standout moments of almostnotcrappiness the scene where lady hogbottoms son runs away with the maid is surprisingly hilarious though its an annoying letdown when they get caught by the police the butler character while very minor is a ray of sunlight that almost but never quite pierces through the gloombr br watching this movie actually caused me physical pain nevertheless there were a few redeeming parts that made it almost watchable without beginning to hemorrhage internally judged on its good parts alone the movie would be about a unfortunately the rest of the movie hardly deserves a thus i give it a 3br br thats being pretty generous id say
7,this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces the fall of the house of usher dance of death poem  is actually quite creepy from beginning to end it is similar to some of the old blackandwhite movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house for example the cat and the canary the old dark house night of terror and so on boris karloff plays a demented inventor of lifesize dolls that terrorize the guests he dies early in the film or does he   and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences i wont go into too much detail here but it is definitely a mustsee for fans of old dark house mysteriesbr br watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened roombr br dan basinger 810
0,i finally saw this film tonight after renting it at blockbuster vhs i have to agree that it is wildly original yes maybe the characters were not fully realized but it isnt one of those movies rather we are treated to the directors eye his vision of what the story is about and it does not stop and to be honest i didnt want it to i do believe that sabu had to have influenced the directors of lock stock  two smoking barrels and run lola run but i absolutely loved the way the three leads see the beautiful woman on the street to distract them momentarily i really need to see this directors other work because this film really intrigued me if you want insight culture sturm und drang go somewhere else if you want a laugh camera movement and criminal hilarity look here
1,a sweet funny story of people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings the excop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this great new york setting even though they are marrying other people maybe a little trite in that the partners are both type a personalities while our protagonists are much more relaxed not anything heavy but it made me smile and hey for the guys  sell the natasha henstridge angle and the gals  sell them the sappy romance everyone wins
6,in the us very few films have been made about rome that were not set in the time of julius caesar or shortly thereafter hollywoods sword and sandal epics mostly have a christian theme which makes it difficult to get into earlier roman history spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule and encountered some resistance in hollywood because it did not have jesus in itbr br its interesting to see at least one picture that not only takes place before the time of caesar and christ but is set when rome was only one city among many on the italian peninsula and had just ousted the hated king tarquin and formed the republicbr br however this is not a historical film its peplum and while the production values arent rock bottom the acting and characterizations are cardboard i can only imagine what the dialogue was like in italian but with wooden english dubbing its very campy i got a few good laughs out of it at firstbr br i havent seen many films of this genre having missed most of the hercules movies of the 60s its amusing up to a point but as the film goes on it gets somewhat boringbr br one things for sure if id seen this movie when i was ten years old i would have loved it at that age i went for anything with romans and swordfights in it so at least this flick brought back some childhood memories
7,it is an extremely difficult film to watch particularly as it targets the innermost core of all of our lives but ultimately it is a very beautiful and deeply moving film any person who finds it cynical i have to say that they must have greatly missed the point of the films entire message for those who actually watch the film they will see that the way the issues are dealt with is absolutely necessary and the outcome is ultimately uplifting sure its very hard to watch a difficult subject matter and even brutal yet its extremely relevant to society and everybody it shows the peak of what world cinema is doing at the moment i will not restrict that term to just france and everyone should try to see it i will say that it is best to go in with a clear head without being swayed by conflicting views and just let the film work for you
7,man what a scam this turned out to be not because it wasnt any good as i wasnt really expecting anything from it but because i was misled by the dvd sleeve which ignorantly paraded its stars as being stuart whitman stella stevens and tony bill sure enough their names did not appear in the films opening credits much less themselves in the rest of it as it turned out the only movie which connects those three actors together is the equally obscure las vegas lady 1975  but what that one has to do with the crater lake monster is anybodys guess br br even so since i paid 150 for its rental and i was in a monstermovie mood anyhow i elected to watch the movie regardless and yup it stunk apart from the fact that it had a noname cast and an anonymous crew an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most i could do with it is laugh at the jawslike pretensions and intentionally so at the resistible antics of two moronic layaboutscumboat owners who frequently squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking on the creature itself  a plesiosaur ie halfdinosaurhalffish  is imperfectly realized naturally but as had been the case with the giant claw 1957 which ive also just seen this didnt seem to bother the filmmakers none as they flaunt it as much as they can especially during the movies second half
1,i tried to watch this movie twice and both times i still couldnt make it to the end credits first time i managed to sit through the first fight sequence then lost interest second time i managed to force myself to digest over an hours worth of shoddy acting lame sfx and extremely poor direction pales in comparison to the originalbr br anyone ever hear about the old et atari 2600 fiasco for those who havent let me fill you in its 1982et is one of the biggest box office smashes of all timeatari decides to release a movie tiein game on their 2600 home console system to cut a long and financially painful story short the game flopped big time and resulted in thousands upon thousands of atari 2600 et games to be dumped in landfills because they couldnt even give them away let alone sell thembr br what does universal soldier the return have to do with this story look at the 32 rating and figure it out for yourselfbr br awful filmimdb forced me to give it a out of 10 because their rating systems doesnt go as low as let alone into the negatives
5,for those of us baby boomers who arrived too late on the scene to appreciate james dean et al martin sheen showed us the way in this great featurebr br the premise is easy enough cool hood meets small town sheriff and allhell ensues but the nuts and bolts of this movie enthrall the car nut in all of us br br no this isnt casablanca nor is it great literature but it is a serious movie about cars rebellion and the genius that is martin sheenbr br enjoy this and appreciate it for what it is and for what martin will become i loved this movie growing up as a teen in the 70s and you will too
0,greetings again from the darkness what a relief  a thriller that actually is thrilling new it girl rachel mcadams wedding crashers and the notebook dominates screen time in this nice little classic suspense thriller from famed horror film director wes craven scream movies and a nightmare on elm street craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the planebr br what makes this one work is the realism of the first 1520 minutes as we see mcadams interact with or people either in person or on the phone she is a natural when she meets cillian murphy the scarecrow in batman begins in what appears to be happenstance the film really takes flight watching the two yuppietypes flirt while the audience knows something evil is brewing is bewitching filmmaking the plane boarding sequence is mesmerizing and the 30 plus minutes onboard is excruciatingly claustrophobic craven keeps us guessing as to the involvement of others and if anyone will come to her rescuebr br as with many thrillers the only letdown occurs during the climax when the lamb turns into a superhero an interesting plot device leads us to believe little rachel has the necessary pent up frustration to see this through but we cant help but cringe a bit the most overdone scenes involve irate hotel guests an annoying airline passenger cillians injury and the fx at the hotel the strength of the film is in the character development and psychological games between the leads sadly the fine screen veteran brian cox is underutilized but overall this is an aboveaverage suspense thriller worth seeing for all but the finale
6,well i guess im emotionally attached to this movie since its the first one i went to see more than 10 times in the cinema  helping me through my masters thesis or rather keeping me from working on itbr br but on watching it again several years and many many movies later  what a wellcrafted little gem this is ive never seen gwyneth paltrow in a more convincing performance and jeremy northam is the perfect mr knightley  where does one meet such a man sigh sophie thompsons turn as ms bates is virtuoso acting of the finest oh napkins sorry and the rest of the cast is no disappointment either  toni colette brings a lot of muriel to her harriet and ewan mcgregor is convincingly charming  and alan cumming and juliet stevenson are the perfect impossible couplebr br of course the sets and costumes and the beautiful soundtrack contribute a lot to the feelgood almost hobbitonlike atmosphere of the movie  although as far as cinematography and art decoration go its almost a case of visual overload very very pretty but a little more austerity might have conveyed a better sense of period but the good thing is the movie doesnt take itself too seriously and there is plenty of fun  and some pretty cool editing  that keep it from sinking into saccharine merry old england modebr br my particular favorite is the ball scene  some beautiful acting and directing here and the concluding dance summarizes the relationship between emma and mr knightley just beautifully pity that the final proposal scene goes on for just a little too long  cut two shots i can think of exactly which ones and it would have been much more in keeping with the rest of the moviebr br gosh i just realize by reading the imdb listings that ive seen jeremy northam in at least three movies without even being aware that it was him  seems hes got a lot more going for him as an actor than just being a gentlemanlike english heartthrob hmm guess i need to pay my video store a visitbr br lovely movie my favorite jane austen adaptation so far  though perhaps ang lees sense and sensibility is strictly speaking the better movie this one is closest to my heart  and ive certainly seen it many more times watch it if you can  and dont be too hard on its little imperfectionsbr br 
0,this production of oliver is masterful in showing layers of evil in the human soul what makes the story remarkable is a brilliantly bright unseen character who pierces this darkness as he leads an innocent boy through the gravest dangers safely into the hands of his own relative yea though oliver walks through the valley of the shadow of death he fears no evil a rod and staff are there to comfort him in the end he is saved from the dregs of humanity at the bottom is fagin the most wicked of the lot fagin contemplates repenting of his ways not once but twice yet declines because he is unwilling to pay the price fagin is worse than bill sikes because he raises little pickpockets who become murderers in the middle is oliver his innocence is unsullied but untried as well the best is nancy lacking in judgment she ignores bill sikes violent nature out of her deep need for love yet unlike fagin at the probable cost of her own life she does repent of her sins by saving oliver from bill things are not as they seem in my opinion this quality is what makes art worthwhile  unpredictability i would give this film a 10 but its 70s madefortv soundtrack and ambiance were distracting overall a fine parable and a thoroughly appropriate story for all audiences
0,this is my favorite movie ever i have watched it at least 10 times and i cry every time my family begs me not to watch it so i wont have a crying fit i think i love that it is a true story written by antwone himself just as much as i love the movie the acting is top notch and the actors were perfect for their role denzel washington is one of my favorite actors but this is my favorite movie he has done so far i took care of a little boy who was also born in jail he was the most precious little boy i had ever met he has now been adopted by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years i saw this movie while the fight was still going on and his future was unsure and i am so happy he is safe and loved and i am so happy antwones happy and found his familybr br i would love to know more about him and how it has been since meeting his family i just cant say enough good things about it
3,name just says it all i watched this movie with my dad when it came out and having served in korea he had great admiration for the man the disappointing thing about this film is that it only concentrate on a short period of the mans life  interestingly enough the mans entire life would have made such an epic biopic that it is staggering to imagine the cost for productionbr br some posters elude to the flawed characteristics about the man which are cheap shots the theme of the movie duty honor country are not just mere words blathered from the lips of a highbrassed officer  it is the deep declaration of one mans total devotion to his countrybr br ironically peck being the liberal that he was garnered a better understanding of the man he does a great job showing the fearless general tempered with the humane side of the man
6,this is a genuinely horrible film the plot such as it is is totally undecipherable i think it has something to do with blackmail but im not entirely certainbr br half of the dialogue consists of useless cliches the other half is spoken by the various actors in such unintelligible imitations of southern accents that thankfully the words cannot be recognizedbr br but the one true tragedy of the movie is that such a historic talent as mary tyler moore apparently was in such dire financial or personal circumstances that she appeared in itbr br 
0,shocking wellmade chiller is an undervalued tale of atrocious murder and evil forcesbr br small town doctor tries to discover who or what is committing a series of violent sexual murdersbr br incubus is a tight mystery with some horrific murder sequences that builds to an offbeat and eerie climatic twist the murder scenes are intense and gory so this isnt a film for the squeamish the direction of john hough along with a bizarre music score combine to create a dark atmosphere of dread that runs through out the film it also carries a kind of gothic vibe as well nice filming locations and some stylish camera work also highlightbr br the cast isnt bad either the great john cassavetes does a solid performance as the new doctor in town also good are the performances of kerrie keane as the local reporter helen hughes as the town historian and duncan mcintosh as a tormented psychic teenbr br all around incubus is a forgotten horror film that needs to be rediscovered and reevaluatedbr br  out of 
4,i was searching through hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a goodlooking horror movie to watch over the new years weekend as i was looking through the shelves severed spotted my eye and i grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent bgrade horror movie the cover looked fairly good the plot sounded semiinteresting so i rented it what a mistake dont be fooled by the cover which actually looks decent im thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself the film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodooinspired ritualistic serial killer called the head hunter who is decapitating victims left and right in some unnamed city probably los angeles and they become drawn into his world of ritualized murderbr br story sound somewhat good well it is and this movie couldve been halfway decent but good god it was bad almost everything about it was laughable the opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge outdated cell phone and for whatever reason she goes outside and talks to some guy then a shadow comes up behind them hacks off his head and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling for absolutely no reason while trying to dial 911 sound ridiculous yep you bet it is the entire movie looks like it was filmed on a vhsquality camera and im assuming it was the acting was mostly awful and the special effects were far from believable and the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful  the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someones bathroom everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious and it didnt hold my interest for very long and i often found myself bored and tired mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography the pacing was bad everything was just badbr br overall severed is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent bmovie the plot was good and i think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget it couldve been alright but this movie fell flat on its face if youre expecting something semidecent youll be sorely disappointed only recommended if you can tolerate dgrade horror flicks otherwise youll probably want to stay away from this straighttovideo garbage it had a little potential but it was beyond a mess 110
1,i know that the real story of little richard is a lot more thrilling than this maudlin and thoroughly average biopic but then producer little richard was probably too reluctant to bring to light any sordid details of his life and just gave us a forgettable facsimile of his career highlights from the 50s and 60s
7,i get it the diehl character is sposed to be a microcosm of america itself  seeing arab terrorists under every rock only to find out at the end that its his own actions all along that got him into that siege state and truly if he practices goodwill to all men everything will be rainbows and lollipops sorry wim you have made amazing movies in the past that stay neutral of the politics and for good reason polemics are your weak point and they weaken this a wellmade amazingly filmed movie with absurd characters dialog and plotting better luck on your next flick another thing that yanked my crank was the belabored point of the homeless section of la being there for reasons of hunger these people dont get enough to eat truly these folks arent eating regally but the real hunger these folks is a spiritual hunger an emotional hunger a mental hunger they need selfrespect selfworth dignity which you cant give a man yeah those folks are hungry and if they need it it is available less the center for hunger in america i would say its more the center for alcoholism drugabuse mental suffering and economic devastation dealing with hunger although a noble endeavor is bandaiding a more profoundly systematic societal and ageold human problem of homelessness bill diehl was good though and michelle williams was cute as the young yet cliched old soul
2,this movie barely followed the story line of the movie all of the fascinating points in the book didnt even exist in the movie they ended up turning it into a cheesy tween disney movie crush story between meg and calvin it was so bad it should have been hillary duff playing the part or one of the likes this movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book i cant believe disney could even get away with making such a cheap basic rendition if youve ever read the book i think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of lord of the rings equivalence this movie should have never been able to use the title of a wrinkle in time poorly done
5,when i was a little girl and my dad owned a video store this was among my favorite movies i hadnt heard much about it since then nor did i really remember anything about it it having been forgotten in the wake of don bluths other probably better films i managed to track it down a few weeks ago however and was pleasantly surprised again set in new orleans in the 1930s the animation is delightful and the songs are memorable there are a few goofs in continuity if you look hard enough but they generally dont detract from the storyline which leaves you smiling and maybe even a little mistyeyed if you are a lover of animals the characters are believable maybe even a little too grownup for younger watchers as well two paws up and for those of you who havent seen it in a while definitely worth a rewatch
5,the idea is nice bringing so many stars in one movie is great but too many stories too short and lacking really any sense no connection between the scenes there were some 34 brilliant stories but these were out of 18 the frame reminded me of all the invisible children  a movie which i liked a lot compared to it however paris je taime lacks the intriguing short story which develops  starts and has its end and it lacks the topic connecting all those  children i do not find paris enough of a topic to connect 18 short sketches togetherperhaps for people who know paris it is interesting otherwise i wouldnt recommend it
3,sandra the making of a woman is a standout among exploitation films and is so for two reasons an excellent yet effortless performance by monica gayle and the fact that gary graver was at the helm of the project these two talents both of whom are quite underrated make sandra a film that should be seenbr br another key element of the films success is its realism  there is nothing fake or hollywood about this setincalifornia film it is truly a slice of life the modest house in which sandra lives at the beginning of the film the simple dresses worn by the character the scene where sandra wakes up in the morning to find uschi digart bouncing at her front door and sandra sits on the couch without makeup while digart tries to sell her some cosmetics looking truly as if she just woke up but nevertheless beautiful the harmless weirdo sandra picks up who likes to make love with her while he wears a bra the oneroom apartment into which sandra moves all of these elements of the film seem totally real and as such the viewer is drawn into sandras little world from the beginning and immediately becomes interested in her and wants her to succeed sandra also makes her case for free love with eloquence and dignity and she comes off with a lot of classbr br this film could have easily failed in less competent hands and could have gone off in any of the usual sexploitation directions but the garvergale team see to it that sandra is not only the making of a woman but the making of an excellent film
7,i question the motive of the creators of this fictional account of the btk killers motives are they attempting to portray animal rights activists as sick monsters who is responsible for this dont they think the people involved with this monster are hurting enough what a blatant disrespect and exploitation of the victims it was like a personality experiment what disturbs you more the slaughterhouse or the human murders they used actual names of some of the victimsthis movie was hideous disrespectful and insulting the creators of this movie used this tragedy for their own agenda people need to awaken and redraw the line
3,this abc straighttotv failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is a wrinkle in time ms madeleine lengle brought children and adults alike into a magical fantastical and original world like no author before her this novel the first in her time quartet is a beautiful take on life the universe and time itself yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand its unwavering morals are prevalent throughout the book this film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of ms lengles work of art honestly what were they thinking the effects look cheap and ridiculous the plot is mushy and uneven the dialogue is farfetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost this was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen i sincerely hope that someday an intelligent worthy director guillermo del toro david yates alfonso cuarn makes another attempt at bringing this book to the screen and understands it for what it truly is a masterpiece this adaptation can only be compared to boring fake and cheap motelroom art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its audience
1,i have never known of a film to arouse such debate in my life believe me when i say that this film will eventually be remembered as an alltime classic i was waiting in anticipation for this film as i had previously loved both lock stock and snatch but after some of the negative reviews i thought i would be very disappointed i absolutely loved this film and i cant wait to see it again this film is totally different to both of the aforementioned ritchie films and also a lot better i have my pick of favourite directors but none of them have pulled off a move as great as guy ritchie has just done with this movie i believe he has taken moviemaking to another level  i know most people will be laughing at this comment guaging the reaction to this film but i believe time will prove me right  this movie is very confusing and carried on for much longer than the 2hr or so running time as i couldnt stop thinking about it or trying to piece things together i have now got a pretty good take on everything that happens in this film  some answers from endless hours of thinking some answers from reading other peoples take on the film and now cannot wait until sunday when i will see it again i just hope people go to the cinema with an open mind and they will hopefully be rewarded as i and many others have been
4,party girl capitalizes on the tremendous charm of parker posey in fact at times the movie seems to be a vehicle in which ms posey is allow to play herself as she normally is in real lifebr br the film directed by daisy von scherler mayer is a treat for ms poseys fans ms von scherler mayer takes us on a wild trip into lower manhattan to show us this aimless soul whose life is dedicated to have fun in the different clubs she constantly frequents this is an era that still was more naive than what that area and the adjacent meat market districts became at least there are no pretensions in the films and we see down to earth people going about their lives in a normal way if we can call it that waybr br parker posey makes an amazing mary its because of parker posey we enjoy the movie more than if another actress would have played mary she is the whole picture the rest of the cast is good
3,are you familiar with concept of childrens artwork while it is not the greatest picasso any threeyearold has ever accomplished with their fingers you encourage them to do more if painting is what makes them happy there should be no reason a parent should hold that back on a child typically if a child loves to paint or draw you will immediately see the groundwork of their future style you will begin to see their true form in these very primitive doodles well this concept of childrens artwork is how i felt about fuquas depressingly cheap and uncreative film bait while on all accounts it was a horrid film it was impressive to see fuquas style begin emerging through even the messiest of moments if you have seen either training day or king arthur you will be impressed with the birth of this director in his second film bait while foxx gives a horrid unchained performance there are certain scenes which define fuqua and demonstrate his brilliance behind the camera sadly it only emerged in the final thirty minutes of the film but if you focus just on those scenes you will see why fuquas name appears on so many best of film listsbr br i will never disagree with someone that fuquas eye behind the camera is refreshing and unique his ability to place a camera in the strangest of places to convey the simplest of emotions is shocking i am surprised that more of hollywood hasnt jumped aboard this bandwagon even in the silly feature bait you are witness to fuquas greatness two scenes that come directly to mind are the explosion scene near the middle of the film and the horse scene close to the end in both of these scenes i saw the director fuqua at work alas in the rest of this film all i saw was a combination of nearly every action film created the likable hero down on his luck that suddenly finds his life turned around by some unknown force is a classic structure that just needs to die in hollywood we have seen this two often and no matter who you are unless you are charlie kaufmann you cannot recreate the wheel it is just impossible with this genre and it is proved with bait i was annoyed with fuqua for just sitting back and allowing this to happen which could explain why it took me three viewings to finish this film i was just tired of the structure and while i hoped that fuqua would redefine it he did notbr br then there was the acting while jamie foxx has never impressed me as an actor i was willing to give this helmed vehicle a try i wanted to see if he could pull off another dramatic role similar to collateral i was under the impression that perhaps this was the film chosen to show producers that foxx could handle the role in collateral again i was disappointed foxx was annoying not in the sense that it was the way that his character was to be but in the sense that it felt as if neither fuqua nor foxx took the time to fully train foxx on what should be adlibed and what should be used to further the plot instead we are downtrodden with scene over scene of foxx just trying to make the audience laugh adding second long quips and culture statements just to keep his audience understanding that he was a comedian first an actor second fuqua should have stopped this immediately foxxs jokes destroyed his character which in turn left me with nothing solid to grasp ahold of instead of character development he would crack a joke neither style worked no joke was funny the rest of the cast was average by this i mean i have seen them all in similar roles they were brining nothing new to the table nothing solid to the story and nothing substantial to the overall themes of the film they were pawns filling in dead air space fuqua had no control over this mess and the final verdict only supports that accusationbr br overall this was a sad film with no creativity in sight and unmanaged actors just trying to upstage themselves what originally started as a decent story eventually sunk faster into the cinematic quicksand foxx was annoying without character lines and a complete bag of cheese in each scene i saw no emotion and when emotion was needed to convey a message he chose to take his shirt off rather than tackle the issues are my words harsh i dont think so when you watch any movie you want to see some creativity some edible characters and themes that seem to hit close to home bait contained none of these while i will give fuqua some credit for two of the scenes in this film the remaining five hundred were disastrous apparently i took the bait when renting this film but now having seen it hopefully i can stop others from taking that curious nibblebr br grade  out of  for his two scenes that were fun to watch
3,its a good movie if you plan to watch lots of landscapes and animals like an animal documentary and making pierce brosnan an indian make you wonder does all those people dont recognize if someone isnt indian at plain sight
6,the scene where sally field and whoopi goldberg go to the mall to revive sallys flagging spirits is enough reason alone to enjoy this movie but wait theres more this is a crackling good sendup of daytime tv movie stars on the way down and up and the horrors of love robert downey jr shows the lighter side of his genius and cathy moriarty is splendid the dialogue is witty and the physical humor done with consummate skill this is a movie that will appeal to those who really enjoy the arts of acting directing and writing
7,lets make a movie about a talk show that already exists and basically have everything that happens on the show well if that idea doesnt intrigue you which it shouldnt stay away from ringmaster i had the displeasure of seeing this in the theater and actually being able to sit through this mess of a movie i guess jerry springer doesnt play himself as it shows from the cheap props for his show yes it looks even cheaper than the real jerry springer show and he is only known as jerry in the film the plot if you can call it that is about a daughter while living with her mother decides to start sleeping with the mothers live in boyfriend so the mothers brilliant idea is to call the jerry springer show as well as getting it on with her daughters boyfriend is it any coincidence they live in a trailer park meanwhile somewhere else in america a woman finds her cheatin man with her friend in bed together so of course call americas therapist jerry springer id talk about the rest of the film but even thinking about the film now is giving me a headache jamie pressly who plays the daughter looks totally unattractive in the movie and remember michael dudikoff the kick ass karate master from the american ninja series well take a look at him now as a white trash drunk the thing is he really looks too horrible and out of shape to call it getting in touch with his charecter but if your idea of fun is seeing jerry springer sing a country song about his own show or guys hooking up with transvestiteswelljust watch the show instead  at least steve was smart enough to stay out of this flick
7,this film though critically acclaimed has of course not yet been released in the us on dvd like another great  christine lahtis housekeeping out the same year but if you can support region australian dvds this little masterpiece should be in your collection there are still some vhs copies available on the internet as welldavis is complemented by a great story as well as memorable performances from her supporting cast especially claudia carvan and the late great jan adele amazingly or maybe not this film and its stars went unacknowledged at academy awards time as did housekeeping but treat yourself to both of them  you will be glad you did
7,this movie is terrible but it has some good effects
0,the darkling was a very interesting and entertaining film while f murray abraham was in it spoilers about halfway through fmurray gets zapped because the darkling is some kind of demonlike creature who enjoys living vicariously he takes bums and losers and perverts them further while giving them all they want in terms of success he feeds from their enjoyment of the seven deadly sins however part of it is that he needs to get people who may be flawed but not completely evil otherwise he cannot pervert their natural goodness thats what the little guy said in his barry white voice which i found both charming and amusing mostly amusing like imagine barry white if he were a little dwarf and he was telling aiden gillen dee plane dee plane bos here eet come dee plane all through the movie dee dwarf actually a robotronic cherub talks to aiden gillen in the barry white voice saying things like its ok to be bad you know you want it now youve committed murder youre really moving up in the world and other remarks that sound like commercials for being evil stores or something it really is hilarious in a sick waybr br anyhow aiden gillen is no f murray abraham and the movie tanks as soon as murray gets the axe or knifed f murray brings a certain happy malevolence to his role in this film he is a good actor aiden gillen on the other hand has a permanent happy smirk on his face and he looks like maybe his remedial english comp class had never hit the mythological characters and he could not imagine what the movie was about the ending is really creepy and yet almost comical if this movie were a parody the ending was perfect if it was not a parody then it was creepy but a cheap use of a little girl to deliver a grossout that the movie itself could not deliver the people who made this movie lost whatever it was that they wanted to do with it somewhere before the ending it just ends like they just realized that they had run out of money and had to film a quickie ending
7,ohhh man now this is what im talking about as far as badcheesy horror flicks go this movie was truly in a class of its own a real gembr br first off the film wasnt originally in english thats okay because the voice dubbing was truly exceptional here is my favorite excerpt from the dialog and there is plenty more where this came from im feeling a little better im just thirsty for your bloodbr br and what drama here is a play by play recap of the interaction between the military and scientistsbr br scene 1 scientist you cant do that itll be a disaster  military officer thats just science fiction he then proceeds to cause a complete disaster just like the scientist predictedbr br scene 2 scientist if you do that many people will die  military officer you dont know what youre talking about he does it and many people diebr br scene 3 scientist dont do that itll kill everyone  military officer thats nonsense he then proceeds to kill everyonebr br scene 7 you get the ideabr br if that wasnt enough there were a few scenes that really stood out as instant classics in one scene the military has literally 10 guys pointing guns at two unarmed men the leader yells go get em and all 10 army guys one at a time drop their guns and fist fight the two adversaries instant classicbr br and dont worry no attention to detail was left out this movie even had a hipupbeat 80s keyboardsynth soundtrack to set the moodbr br and trust me i realize this review might contain some spoilers but there are so many goodies in this epic i really only scratched the surface a movie of this caliber only comes out once a decade a true movie watching experience a masterpiece wow
0,a doctor who is trying to complete the medical dream of transplantation is experimenting secretly on corpses from the hospital with varying success his final best chance comes when he lovingly wraps his girlfriends head in his jacket as he rescues it from a burning vehiclebr br i was looking for cheese and with this premise i believed i found it it has everything everything that bad movie hunters look for  chest and brain surgery with the surgeons leaving with pristine white scrubs unique camera angles i always love watching the rear passenger wheels of cars cheesy clarinet stripper music and one of the longest death scenes in movie history but unfortunately these sobadtheyaregood moments cant overcome the toobadtheystink stretchesbr br jan in the pan annoyed me with her droning monologues in a hoarse whisper the somewhat less than evil laughter and the fact she was kept alive with some columbian home brew coffee and dd batteriesbr br i couldnt even entertain myself with dr bills horrid overacting and moral self righteousness usually such ham makes these movies a must see in my opinion in this case i was bored with itbr br the best part of the movie in my opinion was the 1960s version of body shopping and i even found myself nodding off during thatbr br dont spend money on this one  there are better bad movies out there to entertain your sick sense of humor
1,gone with the wind is one of the most overrated movies in history it is a film loved by mothers grandmothers and shutins who go to the movies once every five years as a zombie movie it blows there isnt a shambling corpse in sight and its terribly light in the gore department zombie on the other hand is big on shambling corpses and quite generous with its bloodspilling  therefore it is better than gone with the wind it is also not overrated most reviewers are under no delusions that it is rubbish it is however not boring rubbish after a terrorist steals a virus he drops it while being pursued by a helicopter and the chemicals leak into the ground the terrorist who has been exposed to the nasty concoction hides in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a flesheating zombie one of his first victims is a cleaning lady once shes bitten lucio fulcis brand of hell breaks loose as usual for a fulci flick the acting is atrocious the storyline is riddled with plot holes and the gore is plentiful turns out the film was directed by fulci and bruno mattei so that explains its rather schizophrenic nature it is badly shot too poorly edited and the sound design is flat still it is saved by its gleeful adherence to the goriest of murders and its impatient pacing definitely worth picking up if youre an undead completest or dont like gone with the wind undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time
1,the first time i saw it i got half of it but i watched and i knew later on it was about a salem witch trials they focused on the sara goods family she is famous for cursing a priest which came true in the film it depicts her daughter dorcas and her husband the spirit of ann putnam saras husband comes to the future hunts this girl to redeem her soul which does happen at the end of the movie dorcas is depict as witch at 5years old who is burned at the stake which never happen ann putnam saves her from the flames the girl is safe she goes to ann putnams grave to to see that is not empty but it is at first because she accuse her of witchcraft and lets her burn to death now that ann putnam saves her her spirit is redeemed and she is not a outcast to society for the salem witch trials
0,this is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the cameroon the sisters in law are female lawyers and judges who in 2004 successfully prosecuted husbands for abusive treatment of their spouses and won one woman a divorce she desperately wanted through a muslim council it is rather long  about two hours  but fascinating in terms both of the individual plaintiffs and defendants and the lawyers who successfully represented them in court rooms presided over by female judges it will leave you as it left me with many questions about exactly how this change occurred how and when did women come to occupy positions of authority in the cameroon have the several cases featured in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women generally by their spouses was the granting of a divorce by a muslim court against the express wishes of the husband a one time event im not suggesting that the film makers could have answered these questions they made the movie two years ago not yesterday and the movie they made deserves a wide audience
3,considering the big name cast and lavish production i expected a lot more of this film the acting for the most part is great although the story they have to work with is mediocre at best however the film still warrants watching because of the acting and the stars and some and up and coming young talent
1,i actually liked this movie until the end sure it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon until the end that is for her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she has struggled to catchup to the other classically trained students what does the main character do wow them with her grasp and execution of this time honored musical tradition no she tortures and butchers the great sensuous habanera from carmen and turns it into an utterly forgettable brittany spearswannabe pop song my ears bled and in the supreme moment of horror her teachers gave her a standing ovation any teacher not in a spearsinduced fantasy would have failed her on the spot save your time save your ears  skip this movie
2,well the big money machine has done it again disney very shrewdly takes advantage of morons like myself who feel we must own every video good or bad stamped with the disney moniker why is it that i continue to look forward to these sequels which make don bluth on a bad day look like leonardo davinci cinderella consists of three storylines already a poor choice doesnt one of the most endearing disney creations at least deserve a linear story of these three only the last comes anywhere near the quality of animation and storytelling that i would expect the music is atrocious and modern meaning in years it will already be dated and adds nothing to the story why does everything have to be updated you know the original cartoon is still popular because of its timelessness so why not be respectful and true to the original with songs that reflect the same style gee i cant wait for a sequel to sleeping beauty instead of music based on the themes of tchaikovsky well get music inspired by britney spears so disney if youre listening remember were not all indiscriminate children out here how about throwing a bone or two to the fans whove been around long enough to know the difference between craft and crap
1,it is not every films job to stimulate you superficially i will take an ambitious failure over a massmarket hit any day while this really cant be described as a failure the sum of its parts remains ambiguous that indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watching it again and again this is a challenging provocative movie that does not wrap things up neatly the problem with the movie is in its structure its inpenetrable plot seems to be winding up just as a second ending is tacked on though everything is technically dazzling the movie is exactly too long by that unit the longdelayed climax of leos awakening comes about 20 minutes latebr br great cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas the compositing artifice is provocative and engaging a character is rearprojected but his own hand in the foreground isnt the world depicted is deliberate treacherous and absurd keep your eyes peeled for a memorable technically astonishing assassination that will make your jaw dropbr br the compositions are stunning whomever chose to release the out of print videotape in the pan  scan format must have never seen it where is the dvdbr br it is unfathomable how anyone could give this much originality a bad review you should see it at least once you get the sense that von trier bit off more than he could chew but this movie ends up being richer for it i suspect he is familiar with hitchcocks foreign correspondent in which devious europeans also manipulate an american dupe and several welles movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does all von trier movies explore the plight of the naif amidst unforgiving societies after zentropa von trier moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary overrated unnuanced sap like breaking the waves and dancer in the dark
3,iedereen beroemd has everything we can expect from a straight to videomovie its the story about a man who believes his daughter could be a star the only thing he needs is to get her on stage surrounded by cameras and reporters a simple plan for which he has to kidnap and do some blackmail the problem with the movie is not the basic plot but how it is made everything is supposed to be funny but it isnt it is trivial and clumsy the characters are shallow and the endsequence is totally without climax or emotion the last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel like laughing but only at how pathetic the whole setup is
7,as a fan of paris jetaime i went to see new york i love you with very high expectations i gladly walked out with all my expectations met it was funny sweet fastpaced and entertaining the film starts out with two cab hoppers bradley cooper  justin bartha trying to get to the same area but arguing which way to go that was funny and then the film goes into some of the best skits i have ever seen anywhere there were four amazing ones out of all the good ones those four i will start talking about one features shia labeouf as a bellhop at a hotel who finds love in an old lady the next one features orlando bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by christina ricci another one features anton yelchin and olivia thirbly as two people going to prom thirblys character being handicapped the best one features eli wallach and cloris leachman as a bickering old couple i will bring to your attention that nataile portman makes an impressive directorial debut directing and writing a skit about a caretaker and ethan hawke and maggie q are excellent as a flirting man and a hooker new york i love you is definitely as good if not better than the 2006 paris jetaime the skits are wellpaced and the film shows how indie films should really be the film however does not have as many famous directors as paris jetaime which is why it was fantastic to live up to its excellence if you want to laugh see some great dramatic effects see an amazing amount of great performances and just plain be entertained then definitely go see new york i love you

3,there are too many new styles of the sitcom but the one that works best is the old fashioned way with an audience and indoor set that 70s show is a great example when the show came on the air nobody really heard of kurtwood smith and debra jo rupp much less the adolescents played wonderfully by topher grace and ashton kushton both of them are leaving the show this year to pursue other interests i wish topher would stay around because the show began about his character eric and his close circle of friends ashton is already the john travolta of our time remember when john was in love with diana hyland from eight is enough think of ashton with demi moore the cast of actors were never known to us which is a good thing because a celebrity cast member can spoil it i miss mo gaffney who played dons girlfriend joanne i miss lisa robin kelly as the original laurie the replacement could not match her and i am sorry about that i liked the casting of tommy chong as the wasted but beloved father figure to steven hyde i loved watching tanya roberts besides charlies angels i loved brooke shields playing jackies mom she really showed her acting talent before heading to broadway this show has been a delight with many surprises i hope this show lasts longer even though of their cast members are leaving but i hope they dont stay too far away too long i wish the shows creators bonnie and terry turner who also created my other favorite show third rock from the sun is more successful on fox than they were on nbc which sabotaged their show the turners are not dummies and i hope they create more shows like this in the future

7,oh god i must have seen this when i was only 11 or twelve dont ask how i may have been young but i wasnt stupid anyone could see that this is a bad movie nasty gross unscary and very silly ive seen more impressive effects at disneyland ive seen better performances at a school play and ive seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo where they do nothing but sit in the water ignoring the children tapping on the glassbr br the story is set in northern australia a handful of ambitious young people are trying out a new water sport surfing in shark filled waters it soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water after they learn what they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his familybr br i think i have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years the best of which is lake placid and the worse of which is its sequel blood surf would have to be the second worst croc flick i think with primeval and crocodile tailing closely behindbr br the australian saltwater crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year movies like blood surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature but a good hour and a half of the viewers life unless you really want to see it avoid blood surf
4,as a collector of movie memorabilia i had to buy the movie poster for this film which now that ive finally seen it has to be the best thing about it theres nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than a 27x41 inch image of the melting man however theres nothing more awful to put in your vcr than an hour and a half long image of the melting man at first i thought this movie was pure garbage but then i realized that it did have some qualities which made me laugh the character of dr ted nelson has to be the most wishywashy persona ever brought to the big screen his dialogue is so trite its unbelievable its incredible he seems to be getting stronger as he meltsbr br and could somebody tell me please how the heck they know exactly how much time steve has left before he melts completely and exactly what their plan is to help him if this movie was meant to scare its audience i think it missed its calling
3,this is truly the greatest swedish movie of all time not only is it revolutionary in its narration but its also among the first movies to feature the next generation of swedish humor and swedish comedians felix herngren and fredrik lindstrm are two of the most intelligent and witty filmmakers in sweden today and this film really puts that on displaybr br vuxna mnniskor adult people is a warmhearted and hilarious story about adulthood and the question if we wouldnt be better off without it

0,i enjoyed this film it was a joy to see a version so close to the vision of peter odonnellbr br a number of people have disliked the film but it has to be seen in context of the origin story that it is the film uses flashback to show the young modesty and the events that shaped her into the woman that she became before the network before willie garvinbr br the pace is a trifle slow and for my taste not enough tension is developed in the present day scenes however this is acceptable just to get such a faithful versionbr br if you like modesty blaise you will enjoy it even with its faults if you just want an action flick with car chases  forget itbr br it has the feeling of being the first of a franchise but as i have never seen it promoted anywhere i suspect there will be no more to follow sadly

7,we all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books while not particularly accurate adaptations these movies were nonetheless excellent films some great examples are the harry potter series the lord of the rings trilogy and to a lesser extent almost every disney film ever made however i must regretfully announce that a wrinkle in time is not one of those movies not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of madeleine lengles fan base it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting acting special effects and ultimately respect for the audience mind you im not trying to be mean on the contrary i went into this affair with an open mind i figured that a madefortv movie would make up for its lack of razzledazzle in its script after all the star wars spinoff ewoks was decent if a little silly come to think of it the original star wars was made on a lunch money budget and look where it took george lucas however from the first scene onward disappointment started enveloping me as if id gotten too close to the black thing while tessering br br the same way greedo shooting first became the symbol of the star wars special edition of 1997 a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic mrs whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is a wrinkle in time the reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting alfre woodard star trek first contact and radio as our favorite starturnedmentor the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow thats right a crow moreover the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eightyearold the majestic halfman halfhorse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle had i been five this would have psychologically traumatized me for life the worst part is the fact that when it spoke it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single unmoving cheek thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than etbr br having gotten the most painful part out of the way i must go on to the tearinducing one the characters the acting and the story i personally had always imagined meg to look somewhat similar to moaning myrtle from the harry potter films plain hair glasses and a figure most supermodels would find laughable she was always a slightly anxious humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of nicaragua in the film she is an unpleasant knowitall for whom i have no sympathy whatsoever in fact she makes me feel sorry for poor mr jenkins her school principal who continuously has to deal with her calvin the kind intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has becomea jock the irony is horrible as for the memorable happy medium they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is above gender and likes to look at funny things such as girls falling off of swings the only three people i can think of who did a decent job are charles wallace mrs whatsit and the man with red eyes nicknamed the dude with red eyes due to his complete reinvention as a characterbr br the story is a mess a good comparison to this aspect of the movie is harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban which didnt do a good job of retelling the story found in the book yet kept the sole of the original work here the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with hades down in the underworld apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed as the dark lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen the flatnosed wookies of ixchel who replace the wondrous beings who hold aunt beast among their ranks tear the spine up as the god of the dead notes how subtle the terror of the earthlike camazotz was the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil br br i am very sorry that this film exists i do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad its the way the characters are written that ruins it a wrinkle in time deserved to be adapted by lawrence kasdan directed by george lucas or steven spielberg enhanced at industrial light and magic scored by john williams given its sound at skywalker sound edited by thx and marketed by twentieth century fox in its current state the film is unworthy to be shown to selfrespecting people even madeleine lengle thought it was bad the book was good the film was bad and mrs whatsit was uglybr br score 0110 if i could br br prosbr br they got the names right br br cons br br it had horrible problems with the cliffs notes level of adaptation script acting and special effects not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book oh and the main coverposter has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle some might say that this symbolizes high adventure i say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who didnt even bother to photoshop megs arm on properly
0,im really surprised this movie didnt get a higher rating on imdb its one of those movies that could easily get by someone but for romantic comedy moonstruck is really in a class by itself its setting and ethnic charm are things people seem to take for granted the casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie few movies in the 1980s were as good as moonstruckand its funny too  out of 
0,this is my first comment this is a fantastic movie i watched it all by luck one night on tv at first minutes i thought it was a b movie but afterward i understood what an amazing product this wasbr br i suggested to some friends to see the movie only to tell me that it was a bad b movie how wrong superficial critiquesbr br i think that the movie is almost a product of genius the well known director made an excellent job here and it is a shame to tell that he was out of the game all this time
1,de grot is a terrific dutch thriller based on the book written by tim krabb another of his books het gouden ei was made into the great dutch mystery thriller called spoorloos the vanishing in 1988 this one is not as good as that thriller although much better than the american remake also called the vanishing but there are times it comes closebr br especially the opening moments are terrific we see a man later we learn his name is egon wagter fedja van hut coming from a plane in thailand when he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border these scenes are perfectly directed photographed and acted a kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this later we see how egon makes his deal in thailand with a woman both stating that they have never done anything like thisbr br from this point the movie is constantly flashback and flashforward we see how egon still as a child here played by erik van der horst befriends a guy named axel as a kid played by benja bruijning we learn how they grew up as friends sort of and how axel as an adult played by marcel hensema became a criminal egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman around this time he sometimes meets axel but does not really want anything to do with himbr br the movie is chronological in a way it shows egon and axel as kids than as students young adults and in their midthirties but from time to time like i said the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adultsbr br minor spoilers hereinbr br the title means the cave and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending although it is in fact not that happy like the beginning the ending is terrific the middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes only to come back at that point in the end it is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well

2,its cheesy its creepy its gross but thats what makes it so much fun its got over the top melodramatic moments that are just plain laughable this movie is great to make fun of rent it for a good laughbr br the film centers around three women newscasters during a time way before cellphones they go to a small town to cover a festival but they cant get a room to stay the night and thats when they meet ernest keller hes creepy in a psycho kind of way and he offers to let them stay at his home but he doesnt tell them the truth about who lives therebr br stephen fursts performance is so amazing as the unseen that he really carries this film most of the movie is kind of dull although finding out the truth of ernests family is kind of interesting br br just seeing this cast in these scenes makes it worth a look barbara bach and doug barr make nice eye candy br br i consider the movie an old gem hard to find and worth a look
2,this is absurd  aside from the fellow australian who has reviewed this flick i cant help but think that everyone else who has submitted a review so far was some way involved in the production of elektra considering how generous they were with their praisebr br admittedly im not really a fan of comicbooktomovie conversions so i didnt go in with many expectations yet still i found elektra to be incredibly underwhelming the thing that irked me the most was the fact that there was so much in this film which went by unexplained that left you thinking huh what relevance does that have to the plot or so how did that aspect of the character come about i can only hope that these are things which are perhaps explained somewhat in daredevil which i have no intention of seeingbr br furthermore the behaviour of the characters in this film appear to do an aboutface at random moments to suit the storyline and dont even get me started about the utterly pointless romantic subplot im also still scratching my head over the fate of caryhiroyuki tagawas character which seems to have gone by unexplainedbr br if i can give kudos to this movie for anything it would have to be the fantastic locations in which it was shot but otherwise i gained little enjoyment from elektra i know were supposed to suspend our disbelief for fantasyaction films but almost everything in this film was so improbable or confusing even by action film standards that it simply frustrated mebr br well hell at least jennifer garner looks damn good
6,bellocchio refers to this as a mainly political movie a description of the revolutionary movement in italy but that seems more metaphor than reality well almost everything in the movie seems like metaphor the revolutionaries of whom we see and about whom we learn very little might as well be mafiosi out with the old and in with the newbr br andreas papa a psychoanalyst seems to stand for the usual traditional bourgeois values  morally upright unperturbed clean and tidy thoroughly ritualizedbr br giullia the girlfriend of a revolutionary seems to represent what can happen to someone who needs very badly a cause to support but is unable to muster up the kind of devotion such a commitment demands im guessing here andrea the adolescent boy seems to be the only guy in the movie who is not in some unquiet way upatz hes respectful of his father but disobedient too he loves giullia or so we assume although hes not really old enough to have learned how to manage his reflexes optimally but he leaves her in order to show up at school and complete his final exams his course between these contradictory lifestyles could be described as media hes the man in between who knows the meaning of gradualism who can keep his cool while those about him are screamingbr br most of this is summed up during the oral part of his finals when he is asked to translate and comment on an excerpt from antigone which contrasts the traditional authority of the gods with the notion of secularity and free willbr br that brings us  by no particular course that im aware of  to marushka detmars she brings to mind a new yorker cartoon of a few years ago two hippos are neckdeep in the river staring at a gazelle drinking from the bank and one hippo says to the other i hate her shes a good actress let me get that out of the way but so is everyone else in the film she carries with her in her speech and manner the rich glitter of outright lunacy and it all comes from the actress too not from directorial aid detmars isnt nuts the way catherine deneuve was nuts in repulsion the walls dont turn to rubber and grow hands instead we see her animated  sometimes too animated and she gives us shocking jolts when her mood abruptly changes and becomes threatening the way a looming thunderstorm is threateningbr br a critic described her as sultry but thats probably not the word he was searching for shes compellingly beautiful with her fluffy brown hair her wide white ready grin her impulsive giggles and her eyes are like the eyes in the paintings on the walls of ancient egyptian tombs the sexy parts are pretty erotic not so much because one of them is explicit but because weve gotten to know the characters involved its more interesting to spy on the honeymoon couple next door than go to a skin flick actually there isnt that much sex there is only one scene of simulated intercourse but the director lets it play out in what seems to be real time at least real time for an eighteenyearold boybr br the young man who plays andrea is fine too which is a necessary thing because the film depends almost entirely on him and giullia they have to carry it and they do if it were not for their performances im not sure this would be as interesting or as admirable flick as it is it could easily have been turned into a rather slow boring romancebr br worth it

0,if you ever have the chance to see sandra bernhard live in person you better move on it sweetie i saw her last year in los angeles at the opening of her everything bad and beautiful tour and i still cant believe that i was in the first row and lucky enough to experience such a phenomenal show she is now in new york with the show and it coincides with the release of her groundbreaking stunner without you im nothing we have lost richard pryor lenny bruce nina simone but sandra is still with us patti smith is missing in action but not sandra barbara streisand continues to peep her head out once in awhile but sandra more than makes up for where babs leaves off okay i want it known ms bernhard is a little of these influential entertainers and more i really wanted to push this film because of its truth honesty humor eclectic songs ranging from laura nyro sylvester nina simone prince and a script that defines the decadence joy sadness ups and downs of the 70s and 80s it is my opinion that many and i mean many comics have lifted okay outright stolen so much from this show if not from sandra herself i wont name names but come on people you and i know who they are see the thing is bernhard plays by her own rules this movie shows as does her live performances that she is a performer who has stayed true to the old school of show business as well as pushing forward her performances are reminiscent of smoky jazz clubs during the time of miles daviscoltranemonk 70s tv shows intimate cabaret acts and concerts that are reminiscent of everyone from judy garland to joan jett most comedians couldnt even touch where sandra is coming from or going to so here i was a year ago watching sandra at the silent movie theater in total awe and joy i wanted to meet her after the show give her something that meant something to me that hopefully would mean something to her but i listen to my copy of giving til it hurts and just thank her in a prayer of sorts for making me laugh making me think making me feel you cant deny this ladys presence and you certainly cannot deny the talent that just rushes from the stage shes still here damn it even after the release of without you im nothing some 15 years ago and she looks great by the way i know this firsthand walking from the theater one audience member said to another she is so funnyand she still looks incredible if you cant experience her live yet please see this movie as for me i do hope that sandra will see this youve meant a heck of a lot to me gotten me through some tough crazy times if you can send me an email please do if not knowing that you are still kicking it out and will continue to do so is enough for me come on people give it up for the lady
4,this film is so ridiculously idiot that you may actually laugh at it but no even this is too much for this lost meters of celluloid i found it as an offer in a magazine and thats why ive seen it i regret the time i lost to see this out of 10 because they dont have a lower grade
5,one piece of trivia that is often forgotten about this family film is one of businessbr br at the time in 1994 this movie held the record for the biggest movie premiere in motion picture history and may continue to hold it was held in pittsburgh pennsylvania  no doubt in honor of the original films angels who haunted the pittsburgh pirates in this remake they haunt the california angelsbr br anyway the premiere was held at the long gone three rivers stadium which was the home of the pittsburgh pirates and the pittsburgh steelers at the time the pirates are now housed in pnc park and the steelers at heinz field the premiere was held on a movie screen that was five stories in height inside the stadium and held and may even continue to hold the record for the largest movie premiere in history shown to 60000 fans danny glover tony danza and christopher lloyd were all in attendance to the admiration of thousands of sports fans
4,for those who like their murder mysteries busy this is definitely the one to see as it is chock full of interesting and suspicious characters most of them wealthy long island socialite types as the star detective william powell is alternately starchy and inspired behaving at times as if he and his suit went to the cleaners and got pressed together mary astor is very lovely here br br powell had made a career out of playing the lead character philo vance in a series of movies made at a couple of studios over several years inbetween these films he developed into a somewhat offbeat romantic lead at times even essaying gentleman gangster roles already middleaged he was stuck in somewhat of a career rut by the time this one came along as with so many early talkie stars it seemed that his time had come and gone that he was fine for early depression prohibitionera films but that with changing times he was perhaps too mature and dandyish to endurebr br the kennel murder case directed by the criminally neglected michael curtiz is one of the last of the old powells while the next year would herald in the first of the new ones the thin man the success of which would catapult its leading players into the hollywood stratosphere in kennel we can see the movies still in a somewhat stiff ritualized pattern as the camera does not move much with the acting like the presentation tending toward the theatrical theres no harm in this approach though which has its charms it gives the movie a baroque quality
0,well its robin hood as geezer all right just as advertised that didnt sound very hopeful and alas it was worse than id suspectedbr br a laddish robin i can take a robin who tangles with a pert dyers daughter i can credit but a robin who exchanges notveryfunny banter with his single henchman is harder to swallow and a robin and entire cast who seem to be having difficulty managing their lines is the kiss of doom how could anyone let such laboured delivery pass without reshooting the scenes again and again much sounds as if hes struggling with halfcomprehended shakespeare rather than letting loose with a salty quip i hoped at the onset that it was just a failed comedy trait in a character clearly destined for the role of comedy sidekick but then it started spreading throughout the rest of the castbr br whatever else you say about errol flynn in the role he had the knack of delivering highflown dialogue as naturally as if hed just thought it up on the spur of the moment and as this production shows thats not at all as easy as it sounds if they were going to cast the characters as cheeky chappies the actors in question should have been given appropriate lines they sound as if they havent a clue how to handle thembr br im afraid i didnt even like the pantomime sheriff for a similar reason the lines are clearly not intended to be taken seriously but delivered and in this case written with a nudge and a wink at the audience theyre out of place all right  fourthwallbusting stuff  but really not that funnybr br this muchpromised production reminded me of a limping school play the only actor and character i felt any appreciation for at all was the one playing guy of gisbourne who was the sole one who appeared to have any handle on a credible villainy and b credible characterisation  but frankly i wouldnt have said that was a very good augury for the future of the series as of the time of writing ill give it another shot in the hopes that things may improve and bed down a bit by next week with less stilted scenesetting required and perhaps the actors more at ease with the dialogue after all the opening episode of doctor who wasnt exactly a showstopper though it was nowhere near as bad as this but if i see no improvement after episode im afraid the series has almost certainly lost one viewerbr br which would be a pity because ive got a soft spot for the robin hood legend on screen from the adventures of douglas fairbanks to the sturdy reliance of richard greene but this robin fails to stir my blood in the slightest
1,this is very nearly a perfect film the ideas would be repeated by mamet but never told so succinctly this is really about the failure of trust of the human condition the film weaves the idea that we are all criminals no one is innocent is there anyone alive today who hasnt seen this play out in our own society every single day the film is very much structured like a hitchcock thriller except there are no more innocent characters the world is now completely polluted ruined and everyone is participating in the con could anything be more truebr br dont miss the soundtrack it is wonderful
1,cracking good yarn with all the actors giving great value michael curtiz at his best lots of nice twists and turns and probably the best of the philo vance series william powell looks wonderfully relaxed and at his debonair best a forerunner to the thin man series recommend to everyone did you figure it all out
1,this show is freaking hilarious the jokes are original god and i love eric and kelso yeah i know what they say after the 8th season its not funny anymore because eric and kelso are no longer in the show and randy is a real dumbass randy is comparing to eric and kelso br br you cant take the funniest characters and switch em with im a cool guy kind of guy randy it isnt his fault anyway but the writers are trying to keep the 8th season funny its still is not as much as the earlier seasons but its alrightbr br the 360s are awesome the circle red is a real kind of mentalabusing dad  and kitty is always halfhigh halfpie hyde tries to be cool all the time he has his moments too the least favrioutes characters are jackie and donna theyre cool but not without kelso and ericbr br great show dumbass
0,the film concerns a classic theme in fact it concerns the theme exploited by batman from beginning to end but in real data and details the mayor of new york appreciated and very diligent and dynamic in order to get some project through slightly faster than normal yields to some pressure from some private business contractors about a criminal drug dealer who should have been sent and kept in prison and he pressurizes the judge in his turn to set him free on probation in spite of a negative probation report that disappears but is not destroyed be it only because of the political value it represents and what was to happen happens and a few people including a black schoolboy is killed in a shoot out between a police detective and that criminal the city may explode because of it racial tension because of the black school boy and social tension because of the insecurity such criminals free to roam around and go on with their criminal activities represent to the public unluckily the film does not show that tension very well and follows the investigation of the first deputy mayor who wants to find out the truth and does find it out but along the way a few witnesses are killed and those who had played some role in the whole business are forced to retire the judge to end their career and life the contractor or the contractors go between a public officer who was ready to deliver the disappeared probation report and some shady character after he provides some crucial information the mayor himself retires and takes a long vacation but the main interest of the film is in the exploration of the contortions the mayor is doing to cover up the problem and the contortions he remembers having done in the past that led to the mistake about this probation case the political philosophy that nothing is pure white or pure black and that everything is grey which is never comfortable to decision makers is invoked as an excuse for wrong but profitable decisions we are not speaking of necessary compromises to get to some consensus in some domains that are crucial to public interest we are speaking of considering as less important to take a bad decision about some petty or supposedly petty criminal than some infrastructure or economic project in the city that is not typical of new york that is true in any mayoral office it is just more significant in quantity and in quality in a big metropolitan area like new york and of course in a city or country where police departments are municipal and are controlled by political imperatives the young deputy mayor is thus pushing the old mayor out of the way and he derails his ambition to be the governor of new york in order to become the president of the us the mayor is perfect due to the embodiment al pacino offers us since he is able to express ten minutes of dialogue with one facial expression that makes the whole dialogue useless i find the end slightly mushy with the exdeputy mayor campaigning in his own name that seems to mean that he was so attached to justice because he saw his chance to push the mayor out of his own way hence he is not better than all the others just still too young in his ambitionbr br dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris pantheon sorbonne  university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
7,come on the new twist is nearly ok but from avenging the elm street children freddy is just killing people now more of the same special effects with no actual character development or anything simply bad and insulting scary nope not at all just bad
7,we loved the movie i am a mother to two little men i love having a movie i can watch with them where men have integrity and character moveis where money is not the most important thing and familys are forever and love means more then words br br i do wish we saw more of the davis family but over all i loved it left me with the same feeling the others did please dont be over we both wish actors would not changethe new actors were good replacement thobr br my year old son loved this movie too asked me to go buy them all he is a movie critic so for him to say this tells me something family should all see this move buy it for friends  help bring back a time of values we will be reading the books now that we are hooked really hope to see more be blessed happy moving
0,if the lion king is a serious story about a young lion growing up to avenge his fathers death the lion king and a half is the total opposite full of whimsy and cheer the lion king told the story from the side of simba the young lion and a half is from the view of timone and pumbaa a less than perfect duo made up of a meercat who left home because he could not dig tunnels without burying his friends and neighbors and a warthog who has an odor issue the movie is a little short on substance but disney does a good job of filling time with various sketches starring timone and pumbaa as they watch the movie with us my favorite is the singalong that happens halfway through the movie make sure you watch the bouncing bug disney has advertised and a half as the rest of the story though it really isnt it is just a different perspective of the lion king without all of the serious stuff that pervaded most of the second half of the original disney classic credit nathan lane as timone and ernie sabella as pumbaa for their voice work without their efforts the movie may not have worked the sing they entertain and they make us laugh they also give us a reason to avoid a hot tub with a warthog
1,a wornout plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case  the equally wornout plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually is shut outbr br with such an outstanding case one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins but scene after scene drones by with no change in intensity no character arcs and inexplicable behaviorbr br the homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary  or on the other hand completely unexplored it seemed to be included only to titillate the viewers when will hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically make a more compelling picturebr br a regrettably dreadful movie when will lauren bacall pick a good one i expected better of her and kristin scott thomas this one is definitely one to miss
0,chris gerolmo took care not to simply give us a jackthestripper type of list of murdered people he delved into the psychological characterization with convincing results perhaps mostly due to stephen reas excellent performance playing off against donald sutherland with good empathy by both it was the playing of these two parts  above all  which made the film something more than just a morbid account of the history of the butcher of rostov supporting actors especially max von sydow carried out their parts really well good directing the photography was good too needless to say the fact that the film was shot in hungary was bound to produce a couple of aberrations but frankly given the depth of the storytelling and interpretations we can completely forget these little trivialiabr br for once a made for tv film from hbo has come up trumps recommended especially if you like to analyse characteriology and forget some of the morbid scenes  which i hasten to add are never exaggerated
7,when someone remakes a classic movie the remake is always unfavorably compared to the original also theres a chance that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unfamiliar to audiencesbr br well the 1973 tv version of double indemnity has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original the main difference is that the remake just seems to have no energy at all fred macmurray was great as the lecherous leering insurance agent walter neff in the original richard crenna just seems worldweary and tired edward g robinson brought great manic energy to his role as macmurrays boss barton keys lee j cobb a fine actor appears almost bored with the proceedings samantha eggar is all wrong as the conniving backstabbing phyllis dietrichson while barbara stanwyck was just superb in this wicked role eggar is overly polite and mannered and just seems way out of placebr br robert webber in the old richard gaines role as robinsons boss norton and john fiedler taking the porter hall role as the crucial witness bring some life to the movie in particular webber recreates the norton role well in a 1970s contextbr br however after the movie starts the whole thing just sort of lies there without any life or electricity this is one film that never should have been remade
2,sergio leone spins in his grave if there was any film that tramples upon a mans life work its this one the lead characters lone wolf bravado is uninspiring and lame and the script was apparently written by a monkey with an eight grade education whoevers idea this was should be horse whipped the only reason im spending time trashing it is because theres a 10 line minimum sergio leones family should sue not because its crap but because now its immortalized as crap by mst 3000 shame disgust i blame hollywoodat least gary busey makes crap that wont offend anyone but cocaine users and weapon expertsthis film is pure blasphemy
0,the title above is used to introduce the film gen to its audience gen is about a young doctordoga rutkay with an ill mother the film starts with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job while she drives we realise that she is not that close home as the hospital is in a remote area as soon as she steps into the garden of the hospital she sees the death body of a patient this is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few daysbr br two policemen comes to the hospital so as to investigate the suicide in fact they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather conditions all their communication with outside world is cut off too there is no way out in those few days there will be more nasty murders now everybody suspects from each otherbr br in my opinion the idea is brilliant it could have been very scary indeed there are positive sides of the movie of course i really like the beginning of the movie especially when she drives to the hospital and her first moments in the hospital actings are okay some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary though i think the final shock should have been spread into the through out of the movie what i am saying is it was a good twist but instead of showing it as a parody in the end we should have realised that was coming when we see what is happening the director needed to explain it altogether which i think didnt work well also the most dangerous patient in the movie is supposed to be at least 48 years old but his body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital lastly i would like to say a few things about the director i am sure he will improve this is his first attempt i have recently found out that he is only 21 years old that made me feel more positive about him and his future films i am not going to rate this film  out of  though
1,nacho vigalondo is very famous in spain he is a kind of bad showman who can make you feel sick very embarrassing nacho had made some commercials in tv i remember one in which nacho was looking for paul mc carney around madrid the commercial was about a mc carney cd collection br br this little movie is like a nachos commercial bad storyline bad directing and awful performances i cant believe that a disgusting movie like this was in the kodak theater poor oscarbr br nacho could made this movie because of his wife the producer of this 735 a woman very well connected with spanish tv business men
6,i dont know how to describe this movie its definitely one of the weirdest movies ive seen in a long time it is very unsettling at times but also boring in other places the scenes of dental torture are very elaborate and may attract anyone whos into gore  splatter i found myself holding my teeth during some of the aforementioned scenes the clever thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears and the dentist is therefore quite unsettlingbr br the humor of the film is somehow hidden and may not be recognized by everyone but if youre a fan of weird and strange entertainment and teeth getting drilled to dust this is just the film you were looking forbr br if you read the comment and feel somehow attracted by this kind of entertainment give it a trybr br my rating 410 maybe a little too weird for my taste
3,several features of this film immediately date it the sound is rather shrill and one realizes what great strides have been accomplished in sound reproduction in the ensuing years the language of the dialogue is rather quaint and unnatural and the acting is still reminiscent of its transition from the stage techniquesbr br bette davis always gives a strong performance in all her films as she does in this early period of her very successful career i do feel however that somehow the cockney accent does not fit the facial expression i think it is the assumed cockney accent that does not ring true for mebr br somerset maughan loves to delve into human relationships of great dramatic intensity which will please all moviegoers as in so many of her character roles bette davis can switch from a beautiful seductive woman to a viper full of fiery hatred leslie howard is well cast as the withdrawn english artist with a club foot desperately seeking a partner and making a bad choice in a scheming little waitressbr br towards the end of the film the young doctor meets his true love in a busy street they cross through the traffic completely oblivious to a multitude of horns and whistles screaming at them this scene is possibly meant to be funny but i find it quite ridiculous in this otherwise very serious film it is probably construed to send you home with a smile on your face and after all as far as we can see and hope for it is a happy ending
6,i bought this cheap from the rental remnant at our local store it was in almost mint condition and id never heard of it before clearly nobody else had eitherbr br i cant believe my luck you go through the whole realm of emotions and it attempts to get over a complex message  the very moral and nontriumphalist stance of the mandela party undoubtedly despite its enormous length i had to watch it in two sittings  it was like a book one couldnt put down perhaps the songs are not all that memorable but the spirit of the thing glows on forever i cannot understand comments that a musical clearly designed for stage is not realistic ive seen south pacific and read the book too and can guarantee that musical is not realistic compared to the book ill treasure this little find until it wears out one day theyll make this again on a better budgetbr br 
1,i would have liked to give this movie a zero but that wasnt an option this movie sucks the women cannot act i should have known it was gonna suck when i saw bobby brown nobody in my house could believe i hadnt changed the channel after the first 15 minutes the idea of black females as gunslingers in the western days is ridiculous its not just a race thing its also a gender the combination of the two things is ridiculousi am sorry because some of the people in the movie arent bad actorsactresses but the movie itself was awful it was not credible as a movie it might be entertaining to a certain group of people but i am not in that group lol and using a great line from a great great moviethats all i have to say about that
5,the movie is an extralong tale of a classic novel that completely fails to capture the original adventures spirit the quite horribly american patrick swayze is cast as the british hero allan quatermain despite the obviousness of his nationalitybr br the movie continues throughout to hollywoodise the story by changing both the plot and the characters to fit more comfortably into the accepted mold the movie manages to be predictable throughout even to those who are not familiar with the story and is plagued by some extremely bad acting and terribly disappointing fight sequencesbr br all in all a terrible addition to the already quite bad collection of movies based on the legend of king solomans mines and allan quatermain
5,i rented this movie tonight because it looked like a fun movie i figured that you really couldnt go wrong with a concept of ex girlfriend with super powers br br  but the movie was confused and pointless br br it seemed that at every turn the writer kept throwing junk in also the writer kept throwing in way too much toilet humor and sexual situations that only a teenage boy could lovebr br it seems that it could have been so simple to draw a story out of fatal attraction super hero  but i guess not br br this is not a fun romantic comedy it was advertised to be you could not take a child to see it and you would be embarrassed seeing it a date br br if the writer could have done a basic story around the high concept and cleaned it up  the movie might have a fighting chance br br a serious waste of timebr br b

6,i have to say that sometimes looks are all that matters just like jeremy clarkson from bbc has pointed out not about our earth though but he is right anywaybr br and when it comes to looks this movie is such an unbelievably stunning beauty you will absolutely love what your eyes are about to seebr br and then theres the personality of the movie as well interesting with a captivating narrator voice and narrator stories that will touch your soul as you watch those superbly filmed imagesbr br the movie probably wont affect your lifestyle ruining these beauties but it will certainly remember you how precious our earth we live on truly isbr br this movie deserves its 10 stars as it is one of the few stylistic earth documentaries i truly enjoyed

2,so steve irwin you have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that clearly is filled with crocs snakes lizards tons of poop from the aforementioned reptiles and mud not only daily but with enthusiasm he was never able to make me want to do it but he managed to make his wife come closebr br this movie does not fall into my parallel universe of film category  the films for people who just had their teeth drilled have a migraine or have no film experience and therefore like quiet mediocrity currently well populated by disney films its too noisy well steve is too noisy hes just so happy all the time and would cut right through the blas teenager i can hear it now that movie was so stupid or the tylenol with codeine id say his enthusiasm is catching but if it was i would own a room full of snakes and that hasnt happened yet i agreed theyre beauties but im still not going to pet thembr br plot was indeed predictable bad guys were so bad for a minute there i thought i was shopping at a consumer electronic superstore but the movie was filled with animals and steve and terri which is why i watched it that plot if you could call it that was really more of a reason to throw yet another croc in a truck my expectations were low and stayed that waybr br i was hoping though that there would be a bit of a sequel where steve and terri having worked on their acting skills have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur i still cant believe we wont see steve anymore i hope that terri and the children continue to be involved in the australia zoo and the discovery channel at least i cant imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the irwin family telling me forcefully how wonderful that croc is crikey
7,i dont think you can get much worse then this put together bad actors fake limbs and three stupid stories and what do you get this brate pointless excuse for a moviebr br the first story immediately shows the bad video quality and the acting is just really pathetic especially when you bring in the 25 year old posing as a grandma with the usually grandma bun over the ears bit plus the man is ok but the woman is rather ugly you look great not the werewolf in this one was the best one out of all three id say but its still not impressive since it was all bad costume the face on the woman later was decent enough for halloween but not for a werewolf moviebr br the more stories you go through the worse it gets there are two lesbians in this next one who are completely retarded its ridiculous the whole i want to be a werewolf too how could you do this to me was silly to say you asked for it now get over it the werewolf will not even be spoken ofits a ratbr br the third one has no pointalmost forty five minutes of running and boring narration make up this story and the whole switch thing still didnt make it interesting boringbr br music yes badwho couldnt even hear some parts it was stupid animals effects were either rat or piglike which was stupid they couldnt use lion sounds guess not good movies use that well i f you enjoy brates this is good for you i got this movie since im a hardcore werewolf fan and ill buy any werewolf movie and watch it more then once but thats just me if you prefer good ones dont waste your money i beg you
4,i dont think i need to tell you the story for it has been told for years and years so i will just share my feelings i first saw cinderella was when i was five years old from then on i was a disney child in a good way the animation now seems childish and old fashioned but that is part of its charm now now in the age of high school musical and computer generated images it seems like people have forgotten the genius and magical essence of early disney movies thankfully i was born before that so i was introduced to this classic and it seems no matter how old i get i turn back into that five year old watching it on vhs which is the true magic of disney
5,back in my high school days in salina kansas they filmed something called the brave young men of weinberg locally and the film crews were rather prominent for weeks eventually we learned that the film was up the academy and was a bit ummm lower brow than we had been led to believe br br i had to see it since i was there and the local audiences seemed less than pleased at the showing i was 17 and thought it was a rather artless attempt at a post animal house type of comedy right down to the fart jokes br br watched it many times since and my opinion has mellowed a bit its dumb but at times it catches a bit of the mad magazine humor at least as well as most mad tv ron liebman might hate it but he is nearly perfect and unforgettable for me my favorite moment would have been a brief scene on santa fe avenue where i had parked my car while i was buying some guitar strings too bad my pintos brief appearance usually seems to get cut for tv havent seen the new dvd but if my old pinto is visible theyve got a sale
0,i enjoyed the story by itself but the things that i learned about wwi planes  boats make this movie a must see the closeups on the plane  the torpedo boat  how they were used were completely new to me i heartily recommend
1,the neil simons sunshine boys starring walter matthau and george burns is a funny comedy on the strange bond to the life and its shortness but the laughter always bitter taste seeing willy clarkmatthau and al lewisburns two big theatrical comedy actors now reduced on the imbecility from the hard and unceasing old age you can feel only anger and blue willy not ever surrender and continue to look work while al is tired for players and he is retired to the country in the house to his daughter the couple in his old time was truly funny and harmony but out the scene was a continue squabble and to quarrel and for eleven years after their broken they not talk between now if they would work they must return together another time for do one of his best old sketch for a comedy story tv show the meets is explosive and liberating for the old questions the neil simons screenplay give a certain corrosive spirit to the story and the melancholy and blue overwhelming the many gags and laughter succeeded to generate a good mix also thanks to a great couple walter matthunomination academy award as best actor and george burnswon the academy award as best support actor the two actors are very believable and real and the their harmony seems almost as they real work together for all that time and that realty they not bear between them the movie is very touching also for its all consuming reality as the story is narrate and how the report loveheat that bind the two actors is totally real part to the strange but at the same time ordinarily comprehensible things to the life my rate is
2,the beaver trilogy is without a doubt one of the most brilliant films ever made i was lucky enough to catch it along with a qa session with director trent harris at the ny video festival a few years back and then bought a copy off of trents website this movie has to be seen to be believed i sincerely recommend searching for trents name on the web and then buying the film from his site hes an incredibly nice guy to boot dont get confused the cameraman in the fictional sections of the beaver trilogy is not trentbr br after having seen the trilogy a few times i do have to admit that i could probably do without the sean penn version its like a tryout version for the crispin glover orkly kid section and is interesting more as a curiosity item if youre a penn fan than it being a good video penn is pretty funny though and you can see the makings of a big star in this gritty bw videobr br this is probably also one of crispin glovers best roles and i would just love to see an updated documentary about the original groovin gary once you see this film youll never get garys nervous laughter out of your head ever again
0,there are pretty landscape shots writers putting trite mouthings into actors mouths with lesser actors this show would be silly art must uplift humanity or its bs not so because art of all those mentioned is also to stir humanity and express the dark side the lead character even says those who dont drink hide the shadow side wrong  he lived in darkness and repressed his dark side by drinking and being one dimensional not expanding his horizons with something other than landscapes there wasnt a breathing organism in his work nor expression of his pain all the artist did was limit himself to dime a dozen landscapes the discussions between the characters was grade school trite stuff always giving the one character the upper hand the writer wanted i tried to like it after reading all the first wow comments on here i had to dig deep to see those i agreed with i figure the great comments were from those connected to the movie i was moved only once towards the end the kid was way too passive the scenery was nice and the music ridiculous just my opinion but nowhere show for me
0,worst movie i have seen since gingerale afternoon i suppose that this is a horrorcomedy i pretty much predicted every scene in this movie the specialeffects were not so special i believe that i could come up with as good of effects from what i have lying around the house i wish i could have something good to say about this movie but i am afraid that i dont even coolio should be ashamed of appearing in such a turkey i do after a little thought have one thing good to say about this movie  it ended
5,let me start out by saying this movie has funny point at the very beginning with the exchange between the narrator and george narratorhuh wait a minute who the heck are you george me new george studio too cheap to pay brendan fraser narrator how did you get the part george new george just lucky i guess br br sadly thats the only funny part in the entire moviebr br it was still entertainingbut then again im easily entertainedbr br i wouldnt say this is the worst movie ive ever seen that title goes to the terribly unfunny disaster movie this movie falls on my bottom 15 listbr br if your a small child who is easily entertained youll enjoy this movie if youre a moviewatcher who wants a good funny movie youll end up shooting yourself halfway through this one
7,i love low budget independent films and had high hopes for this one but this film is static never mind the production value which is very noble for its budget but the pacing is deadly admittedly these folks achieve much with little but the film fails on the most fundamental level its boring the editing is glacial and the pacing stalls it should have been 65 minutes the best thing about the dr jekyll is mr hyde who isnt seen nearly enough he had the most dramatic potential instead we have to suffer through dithering baltimoreanbrits stammer through endless and tiresome exposition it feels like a backwater stage play committed to videobr br noble efforts by everyone in the production but a story this tired needed a kick in the pants and funky new low budget technology should have given it a fresh voice instead its just a lame retread
7,timberlakes performance almost made attack the screen it wasnt all bad i just think the reporters role was wrong for himbr br ll cool j played the typical rapper role toughestbaddest guy around i dont think the cracked a smile in the whole movie not even when proposed to his girlfriendbr br morgan freeman pretty much carried the whole movie he was has some funny scenes which are the high point of the moviebr br kevin spacey wasnt good or bad he was just therebr br overall its a dull movie bad plot a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for actors
1,what keeps us going  or at least what i feel the writer wanted us to keep us glued at an early point is our desire to know whether martinaud has done the dirty deed without spoiling so much of course there is a red herring and a twist but then we discover that this is the story of martinauds imperfections and his difficulty in coping when there is the revelation  we begin to sympathize and pity him because as the story progresses we are made to think he is the sick perverted pedophiliac that were predisposed to have in mind one of those things he has to cope with is the distant gap he and his wife have even though they live on the same roof these problems of course are given their denouement in the films shocking finalebr br this movie demands your patience and it has certainly tried those of restless teenagers sitting at the rear they were heckling obviously because they arent partial to central location films although there is a bit of travelling when we get to the woods and the beach and we realize that gallien isnt as clever as we are made to think he isbr br the inquisitor is 55
7,at the height of the celebrity big brother racism row in 2007  involving shilpa shetty and the late jade goody  i condemned on an internet forum those cbb fans who praised the show after years of bashing racist 70s sitcoms such as curry  chips  love thy neighbour i thought they were being hypocritical and said so it aint half hot mum was then thrown into the argument with some pointing out it had starred an english actor blackedup well yes but michael bates had lived in india as a boy and spoke urdu fluently the shows detractors overlook the reality he brought to his performance as bearer rangi ram the noted indian character actor renu setna said in a 1995 documentary perry  croft the sitcoms that he was upset when he heard bates had landed the role but added no indian actor could have played that role as well as bates indeedbr br mum was perry and crofts companion show to dads army also set in wartime the sedate english town of walmingtononsea had been replaced by the hot steamy jungles of india in particularly a place called deolali where an army concert party puts on shows for the troops among them bombadier solomons  george layton his first sitcom role since doctor in charge  camp gunner gloria beaumont  melvyn hayes  diminutive gunner lofty sugden lah dedah gunner graham  john clegg  and gunner parkins  the late christopher mitchell  presiding over this gang of misfits was the bellicose sergeantmajor williams  the brilliant windsor davies  who regarded them all as poofs his frustration at not being able to lead his men up the jungle to engage the enemy in combat made him bitter and bullying  though he was nice to parkins whom he thought was his illegitimate son  then there was everso english colonel reynolds  donald hewlett  and dimwitted captain ashwood  michael knowles  rangi was like a wise old sage beginning each show by talking to the camera and closing them by quoting obscure hindu proverbs he loved being bearer so much he came to regard himself as practically british his friends were the teamaking char wallah  the late dino shafeek who went on to mind your language  and the rope pulling punka wallah  babar bhatti  so real indians featured in the show  another point its detractors ignore shafeek also provided what was described on the credits as vocal interruptions  similar to the 40s songs used as incidental music on dads army  each edition closed with him warbling land of hope  glory only to be silenced by a shut up from williams the excellent opening theme was penned by jimmy perry and derek tavernerbr br though never quite equalling dads army in the publics affections mum nevertheless was popular enough to run for a total of eight seasons in 1975 davies and estelle topped the charts with a cover version of that old chestnut whispering grass they then recorded an entire album of old chestnuts entitled  what else  sing loftybr br the show hit crisis point three years later when bates died of cancer rather than recast the role of rangi the writers just let him be quietly forgotten when george layton left the character of gloria took his place as bombadier providing another source of comedybr br the last edition in 1981 saw the soldiers leave india by boat for blighty the char wallah watching them go with great sadness  as did viewers br br repeats have been few and far between  mainly on uk gold  all because of its socalled dodgy reputation this is strange for one thing the show was not specifically about racism if a white man blackedup is so wrong why does david leans 1984 film a passage to india still get shown on television  it featured alec guinness as an indian and won two oscars  it was derived from jimmy perrys own experiences some characters were based on real people  the sergeantmajor really did refer to his men as poofs  i take the view that if you are going to put history on television get it right sanitizing the past no matter how unsavoury it might seem to modern audiences is fundamentally dishonest mum was both funny and truthful and viewers saw this thank heavens for dvds i say time to stop this review as williams would say ill have no gossiping in this jungle
7,i think the show had a pretty good concept to work with but the execution was poor the script is poor and acting is bad there were many issues that could have been portrayed in a better way like the protest against gay marriage or finding the graveyard the show cant be properly termed as comedy show as it lacks humor miserably i should say this show was barely successful in putting the life of muslim community to some extentbr br till now second season is worse than the first one i had my hopes high regarding this show but i was kind of disappointed still i appreciate cbc for putting up such concept in front of the viewers anyway i wish best of luck for the future
0,the premise and subject about making a criminal realize what his victims went through by capturing his family hostage sounds promising and interesting but this is the only interesting part which was also dealt 20 years ago with quite finesse by director ravi tandon in his film jawab1985 too the problem here is ace director rajkumar santoshi found himself in some sort of confusion as to whether to make it a fast paced actionthriller viz khakee or an emotionsrich heavy duty drama viz damini and this confusion is quite evident in the final outcome if we ignore two of hispukar 2000 and lajja2001 this brilliant director has always given us fairly engrossing films with high entertainment value therefore this film comes as a surprise as to what made this script sensitive director going for halfbaked characterization of both of his protagonistsamitabh bachchan and aryeman as the film is getting over audience didnt know whom to hate and whom to sympathize with and this factor is the major limiting force in the complete narration therefore what starts as a war between a common man and an underworld don ends on a strange note of selfrealization and regret by the don about what went wrong with his own family the revelation of dons son as a real baddie does not come as a surprise element in the climax which if compared to similar situation in khakee worked so effectively with aishwaryas character that is not all there is more to it the whole dramatization of life of an underworld don operating from abroad looks quite illogical his openly landing up at mumbai from where he is suppose to be absconding as well as running after his enemies and shooting them himself does not look believable pitching a mediocre newcomer actor like aryeman opposite mr bachchan is again not a good idea but nonetheless film has some plus points ashok mehtas fine camerawork two good fight sequences coordinator abbas ali moughal some light wellacted scenes of akshay kumar in the ist half santoshis fastpaced slick treatment and of course mr bachchan as usual trying hard to put some life into his lifeless character but all these put together does not make this viewing an exciting experience for you and your family
0,the tenuous connection between this film and the first grease is established right at the beginning of the film when didi conn one of four cast members repeating their roles approaches young maxwell caulfield who is a british exchange student although in the previous film olivia newton st johns foreign speech pattern is not explained its explained here caulfield is her cousin whats conn still doing in school i guess she just likes hanging around rydell high even though now shes a beauticianbr br caulfields a smart kid so of course the hood types led by adrian zmed have him labeled as a nerd and thats especially bad when zmeds girl friend decides she likes caulfield but being a nerd just isnt going to cut itbr br thats when caulfield decides to put on a modern day zorro act he gets a junked bicycle and puts it back together and teaches himself to ride he gets himself a leather biker outfit with a set of goggles to hide his face if getting michelle pheiffer is not in the cards caulfield wont have any trouble making friends at any gay male leather bar the way hes outfittedbr br grease introduced michelle pheiffer and maxwell caulfield and started them on the successful career paths both have enjoyed if you saw the first grease film a much better film than you definitely have an idea how this film will turn outbr br in addition to conn eve arden sid caesar and dody goodman all faculty members from the original grease return in their roles the music score isnt remotely as good as the songs that come from the originalbr br its not that grease is bad its just not all that great
7,decent enough with some stylish imagery however the tiny budget hampers thingsbr br i also get the impression they were trying to shock you with some of the graphic weirdo perv website stuffbr br if you like anime in particular stuff like cyber city and the ad police then this might up your streetbr br but basically its low budget matrix cash in however not totally devoid of its own stylebr br great soundtrack by some unheard of grungepunkpost grunge bands worth checking out if only for the soundtrack
7,i had no idea what the film is about before i saw it because tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted so i asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that it is the directorial debut of vijay krishna acharya who wrote the screenplays for dhoom  and saif ali khans son ibrahim makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashbackbr br after watching it i understood that why their wasnt a proper trailer because there wasnt anything in the film to show the story was extremely dum and even a 10 year old child can come up with a better storyline there was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and its difficult to figure out that who is killing who also the action was daft  unrealistic eg man with a handgun managed to kill about 100 men with machine gunsbr br while i was watching tashan it reminded me of filmsbr br sin city during the opening creditsbr br koyla anil kapoors terrible english like amrish puri in koylabr br jhoom barabar jhoom the outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funnybr br i also heard the budget is 40 crores which is the same amount as dhoom and i dont know where all the money went to anyway if you did not like dhoom then there is absolutely no chance that you will like tashan race was hot on heels and that is a million times betterbr br the only good songs are dil haara  challiya and both songs are shot in greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film even anil kapoors terrible english couldnt save this discomfiture
2,up until this new season i have been a big little mosque fan however the new season had absolutely ruined itbr br the new christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show it has always been about living together to overcome prejudice the new vicar ruins that premise and shows christians in a very bad lightbr br i am neither christian or muslim but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between amar and the reverend not any morebr br just cancel it and be done with it its not worth watching any morebr br it might still be saved but a lot of change would need to be madebr br bring back the old format
4,this show has a great storyline its very believable a mans wife dies and he cant take care of his children alone so he calls on his brother in law his best friend and many others come later on in the show such as rebeecca donaldson the lovable yet strong dog comet  nikki and alex who you can find out for yourself i dont want to spoil it for you and of coerce kimmy gibler the sidekick of dj but the kids are wonderful too this is mary kate and ashley first took off and also you may know candace cameron bure from shows like stelsewere punky brewster and thats so raven jodie sweetin plays steph the love able middle child who feels left out really this is a very good show
6,wow watching this film today you cant help but be appalled by the writing of this film spencer tracy and loretta young play a couple who in modern times might be featured on the jerry springer showas they have a sick and abusive relationshipand inexplicably the writers appear to be endorsing it br br the film begins with a hungry and homeless loretta being shown the ropes by the poor but very resourceful spencer tracy he shows her how by conniving you can do very well with little money and takes her home to his shack to stay its never clear whether or not they marryand considering its a precode film you can assume they arent even though they are cohabiting their relationship is very strangeand rather sick while you can see that tracy cares about her by his actions he is verbally abusive and a total jerkand young comes running back for more like some sort of dog he calls her skinny or ugly and these are in a sick way his way of using endearments later when he starts fooling around with another woman glenda farrell she tells her friend that if thats what he wants its okay with her it sure smacks of a sadomasochistic relationship and you cant help but feel a bit horrified sure he doesnt hit her but the relationship is very abusive to show how sick it is when young gets pregnant she tells him its your baby and its mine but you dont need to worry ill take all the blame for it yikes doesnt this all seem a bit like looking through a peephole into a sick and dysfunctional home later in a case of art imitating life tracy proves what sort of man he is and disappears after all he cant be burdened with a babyeven if its his but he changes his mind and decides to return home wowthats bit of him and when he returns hes nasty and acts like if he stays he isnt obligated to care for the kid and she tells him hes a free manfree as a bird wow i was almost in tears at this tender momentnot soon this crazy pair are marriedand naturally young is depressed because he seems to be staying as long as it suits himnot because of any love or sense of responsibility so how can you salvage anything with this sort of sick characters what would you do well as for the writers they have tracy soon commit a robbery to help pay for the brat the romantic aspects of the film are underwhelming to say the least during the robbery tracy behaves like a chumpdoing almost nothing to take precautions not to get caughtlike he was secretly hoping to get sent to prison and to show what sort of nice guy he is the guy he tries to rob is one of his best friendsbr br while theres more to the film the bottom line is that tracy is a jerk and young is an idiot in the film despite both being very good actors theres absolutely no way they could make anything of this crap the writers produced nice music nice sets good actingand a script that is 100 poo how the film is currently rated 74 is beyond me and i wonder how anyone can ignore the pure awfulness of the characters a horrible misfire that somehow didnt destroy the careers of those involvedbr br oh and if you wonder if loretta ever gets a backbone in this film or plays a person who is the least bit strong the answer is no by the end shes learned nothing and hasnt changed one whit for the betterbr br they sure dont make films like they used toand in this casethank god
7,i am glad to see most other people here dont think much of this movie either it has some big names in the cast but thats it there is nothing else to recommend save ogling a few pretty women which you can do in a thousand filmsbr br the story involves nothing but unlikable selfcentered chainsmoking hip characters that national film critics all seem to likeand most of the public cant stand br br the oklahoma accents are so fake they are laughable the southern racist stereotypes are right from liberal hollywood 101 and the story is depressing
6,those who know who know the kelly legend  are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film eg naomi watts character never existed in reality but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment it holds up pretty well ledgers performance in the title role is quite solid taking the mantle of cinemas best ned not hard considering the previous neds include yahoo serious mick jagger  former carlton champion australian rules football bob chitty a great footballer but a poor actor some location shooting film in the area i live bacchus marsh outside melbourne as well as clunes  ballarat
5,i think i usually approach film festival comedies with the low expectation that they will invariably be quirky and that any intended humor will be derived solely at the expense of the characters simplicity in the face of a complicated context what was exceptional about big bad swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his film while still finding laughoutloud humor in scene after scene there was a sophistication maybe due also in part to the sharp work of the dp ive rarely seen in an indie film and even more rarely in a comedy of special note here paget brewsters turn as amy the math teacher after seeing this performance i cannot understand why brewster hasnt been discovered by a larger audience she brings the necessary mix of anger and likability to the role that really helps this picture reach its potential this is a terrific work deserving of a larger audience i look forward to more from the director and this cast
7,the cast really helps make this a pleasant surprise and a cut above the normal manvswomanargueallthetimebutwind upin lovetype of hollywood screwball romancecomedybr br i usually dont go for those type of films and that tiresome storyline but this one was refreshing fun to watch and oozes with charmbr br jimmy stewart and margaret sullavan play off each other well and make a very handsome couple the supporting cast is outstanding  from the alwayslikable felix bressart to the villain joseph schildkraut br br frank morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters ive ever seen him do in his career he takes the film and turns it around into a whole different mood for awhile when something dramatic happens to him that twist is another reason this film rises above others of its kindbr br once again when a film has a good mix of categories it usually succeeds this is a great example of that in this movie its romance comedy and drama and its well done ill take this over the remake youve got mail any day no comparison
7,i remember rather enjoying this a few years back but coming to it again i wonder why i guess it always looks good and the girls do rather well but the men do rather let the side down why oh why in so many english films about sex do we have to have such inept men along side the pretty girls what is more this begins predictably enough as a sex farce similar in vein to the confessions films but about a third of the way through whilst we are beginning to enjoy the presence of the lovely me me lai the film asks us to start taking it seriously not only that but the central rock club and cannabis sequences are very forced and just look stilted in short this is neither as innocently silly or as intelligently serious as it seems to intend richard osullivan maybe as such a central figure could have helped but i reckon this to be one of his worst performances just worth it for the ladies
0,i saw it at the legacy theater in the joseph smith memorial building in salt lake city this morning im going to assume that ones level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be based on ones level of acceptance of josephs storybr br however that aside it was very well made well acted and had a nice score if you get to salt lake city it is a must to see it in the legacy theater i have never been in a nicer theater as far as picture quality sound quality and ambiance in my entire lifei wonder if the church would let me watch batman begins there being that im lds and regard joseph as a prophet i was touched in several places and was brought to tears quite a few timeswhich i presume is expected since they handed out tissues before the movie started anyway im told that this film is available in several lds visitor centers around the globe if you have 70 minutes check it out because whether you believe joseph smith or not he tells a fascinating story
2,jack frost no kids its not the warm hearted family movie about a dad who comes back from the dead in the form of a snow man its about a sadistic killer named jack frost who is sprayed with some acid fluid and is morphed into a killer snow man i happened to catch a copy of this movie so i could have a nice sit back and laugh at it a killer snow man ha sounds like the perfect comedyhorror movie well i was wrong very wrongbr br jack frost is about a killer who is being transported via truck to jail so he could fry in the chair at midnight but its a snowy night and it collides with a government tanker carrying a new dna fluid jack escapes only to be burnt to death by the acid and morphs into a killer snowman he returns to the small town of snowmonton where he was caught by a small time sheriff here he is ready to kill again now as a snow man with cooler powers he can condense into water shoot out ice cycles as spears and grow killer fangs the only question is who can stop frost this movie is below the typical bmovie line the movies begins cheesy but as soon as jack is burned by the acid it quickly drops below the cheese line and goes flat the acting for one is appalling here we have a whole cast of unheard of actors who either cant act can act but has a pointless character or is just here for a few extra bucks the only good actor is scott macdonald who plays jack he looks like a young richard kiel combined with frankenstein sadly his appearance is only reduced to three minutes and all we ever see of him is his new snow man form and his wise cracking voice plus his wisecracks are anything but funny groaning stupid and badbr br the plot is horrible throughout history there have been numerous murderers a killer in a hockey mask a killer with a razer glove a chainsaw wielding moron a rapid st bernard but now we stoop to a tacky killer snow man oh come on and the way the characters are introduced are terrible for one i really wanted jack to kill the sheriffs son i mean giving his dad oats with antifreeze in them so they wont freeze all the characters are dumb and pointless and the deaths are to cartoony one woman in strangled with christmas lights and has her head smashed into a decoration box and a girl is humped to death in the shower where is the carrot in that scene ehbr br and to top of this horrible movie is the special effects the first big special effect we have is jacks dna mixing in with snow and boy is it terrible i mean it looks like a 60s fashion of art design pu jack looks fake as well he looks like a person covered with rubber snow man skin all the blood and gore is cheesy and the film never takes off with greatness but instead stoops to low levelsbr br jack frost is one of the worst slasher movies ever made i thought it would be a riot but no it doesnt try to be funny and it actually tries to be scary jack frost gets out of 10 it at least made me laugh from its awfulness dont even bother with this piece of trash jack frost d
4,george lopez is a funny man even without the sitcom the first episodes i saw of this too often made jokes at the expense of his mom as i have watched this more there has been more  more variety no one on the cast is really safe from his wit nowbr br it seems to me as this season has progressed that george is getting more comfortable with the family sitcom dad role at first he wasnt but he is getting more  more into a groove this makes both him  the shows progressively funnier they had added a couple of characters for george to play off this year too his wifes dad is getting more  more involved in the plotbr br his mom is still there but not as central as past seasons i think it is prudent to say with georges sense of comic timing  abcs lack of good sitcoms george lopez has a good chance of being here on abc long after george w bush
5,although i bought the dvd when it first came out and have watched it several times i never wrote a reviewbr br i loved it when i first saw it and i love it stillbr br sadly it seems it never made enough money to motivate anyone to do a followup i have to assume qt still controls the rights but after kill bill if he does a film that is as true to the comics and books as my name is modesty with another tough female lead anyone not familiar with the character will see this as a letdownbr br peter odonnell wrote his stories to focus more on psychological suspense rather than action thrillersbr br the tug of wills between modesty and miklos is very true to the source material and is tense suspenseful and fascinating to anyone who doesnt have to have gore and explosions alexandra did a great job in playing how odonnells character would have taken control of the situationbr br i find this particularly ahead of the curve following the sorely needed reboots of batman and james bond after dismal earlier efforts although not nearly as well known to the public this is really a reboot of the modesty character and it is really sad that probably no more films about her will be made
2,watch on the rhine started as a broadway play by lillian hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on broadway at a time when the soviet union was still bound to nazi germany by that infamous nonaggression pact signed in august of 1939 so much for the fact that hellman was merely echoing the communist party line the line didnt change until a couple of months later lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this workbr br the play watch on the rhine ran from april 1941 to february 1942 for 378 performances and five players came over from broadway to repeat their roles frank wilson as the butler eric roberts as the youngest son lucile watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain george coulouris and paul lukasbr br lukas pulled an award hat trick in 1943 winning an oscar a golden globe and the new york film critics for best actor probably if the tony awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well the oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against humphrey bogart for casablanca gary cooper in for whom the bell tolls mickey rooney in the human comedy and walter pidgeon for madame curie every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was lukass nomination is usually the kind the academy gives to round out a fieldbr br jack warner knew that which is why mady christians did not repeat her broadway part and the role of lukass wife was given to bette davis davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it its the same reason she did the man who came to dinner a much lighter play than this onebr br davis is the daughter of a late american supreme court justice who married a german national back in the weimar days after many years of being vagabonds on the continent of europe davis lukas and their three children come to america which has not yet entered the european war theyre made welcome by lucile watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildrenbr br the fly in this ointment are some other house guests a friend of daviss from bygone days geraldine fitzgerald and her husband who is also from europe a rumanian diplomat and aristocrat george coulouris coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects lukass antifascist background br br his suspicions are quite correct its the reason that the family has been the vagabonds theyve become lukas fought in spain on the republican side and was wounded there his health has not been the same since his family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes those decisions affect all the other members of the castbr br adding quite a bit more to the broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was dashiell hammett who was lillian hellmans significant other coulouris playing cards at the german embassy was a hammett creation with such loathsome types as henry daniell kurt katch clyde fillmore erwin kalser and rudolph andersbr br coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account runmanian count he was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after stalingradbr br lucile watson was up for best supporting actress in 1943 but lost to katina paxinou in for whom the bell tolls dashiell hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for best picture to that other antifascist classic casablanca br br though its an item firmly planted in those specific times watch on the rhine still packs a stern antifascist message that bears repeating infinitely
6,it was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including john ritter ben gazarra and audrey hepburn they looked quite wonderful but that was it they were not given any characters or good lines to work with i neither understood or cared what the characters were doingbr br some of the smaller female roles were fine patty henson and colleen camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts they showed some talent and it is sad they didnt go on to star in more and better films sadly i didnt think dorothy stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film rolebr br the film appears to have some fans and i was very openminded when i started watching it i am a big peter bogdanovich fan and i enjoyed his last movie cats meow and all his early ones from targets to nickleodeon so it really surprised me that i was barely able to keep awake watching this onebr br it is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other five years later bogdanovichs exgirlfriend cybil shepherd had a hit television series called moonlighting stealing the story idea from bogdanovich of course there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball linesbr br bottom line it aint no paper moon and only a very pale version of whats up doc
2,brendan filone is the absolute best character in the sopranos he died by getting shot in the eye this was the best and well orchestrated scene ever in the sopranos brendan filone is too good brendan filone shall haunt uncle junior in his dreams until uncle junior cant take it anymore brendan filone is the best character brendan filone was killed in episode  denial anger acceptance but his legacy will live on forever brendan filone is the best character on sopranos brendan filone is the best character ever i recommend this show to anyone who likes drama and wants to see good death scenes and great directing and producing because it doesnt get any better than this series brendan filone is the best

1,noni hazlehurst colin friels alice garner chrissie amphlett and michael caton what more could you ask for monkey grip based on the prize winning novel of the same name explores nora hazlehurst a single mother falling for a heroin addict jobe friels a simple story is made truly extraordinary through the all round magnificent acting in particular noni hazlehurst and nice use of the small budget the only flaw is if you can pick it up is that the story is set in melbourne although for budget reasons the film was mainly shot in sydney so as a result in a few scenes you see trams melbourne scenes and then a carlton post office sydney scenes other than that monkey grip is a must see excuse the clique but it is at least for an award winning performance from former play school and better homes  gardens presenter noni hazlehurstbr br 1010
4,cradle of fearbr br this isnt a movie where intricate delicate little narrative nuances occupy our attention this is not a film where the special effects are supposed to leave us slackjacked uttering that sense of whoa what it is though is a slice of lofi goth horror which leaves little to the imagination created in the eyes of the director alex chandon as a throwback to sleazy 70s and 80s horrorbr br this is a very visceral experience for hours where four plot lines are connected through lots of watery blood reams of dismembered body parts and innards tied by an intestinal thread of revenge br br the purveyor of such horrific violence is dani filth leadsinger of the metal band cradle of filth executing a role he was destined to play br br as others have said there is nothing new about wanting to carryout occultist revenge in this particular context a convicted sexual predator and murderer kemper the father of our devilish avengingangel compels his son to exact retribution on those who are some how connected to convicting him to purgatory within an insane asylumbr br what this provides for the chandon who should be congratulated on also penning and editing this piece is the opportunity to let his sick mind run free he seems to take delight in the idea of splattering blood into the orifices of those on screen and into every nook and cranny that can be reached we are also treated to closeups of skulls being crushed demonic rape and other assorted imagery to engage those who relish getting up close and personal to their horror and for some of those who closely follow these type of films there is the odd sequence which may have you thinking did i just see what i thought i did because of course pretty woman this aint it reminds me of some of the gorefests created out of italian horror some 20 to 30 years ago and a number of other works where disgusting images have left their mark but not the context in which they were viewedbr br story of the set is particularly intriguing where the idea of ones obsession can ultimately lead to death in the pursuit of internet violence through the sick room where the user is in control of how a life can be snuffed out further acknowledgements should also go out to a pounding soundtrack that allows filth to exercise his daytime talent and an effective use of drum and bass often overlooked in filmmaking as a viable form of supporting visuals using the city of london as a backdrop with real people as opposed to movie standins also adds support to the commando feel of the film ok classic it may not be but blood guts intestines occult and demons in a slightly perverse unproblematic way it is
7,this is a movie that gets better each time i see it there are so many nuanced performances in this william tracey as pepi is a delight bringing sharp comic relief joseph schildkraut as vadas is the only villian in the movie and his oily charms are well used here frank morgan is delightful as the owner of the title shop mr matuschek and his familiar manner is well used here i especially liked the performance of felix bressart as pirovitch very believable in every facet of his rolebr br the two leads are equally accomplished with margaret sullivan doing an outstanding job of portraying a slightly desperate neurotic yet charming and attractive womanbr br this movie belongs to jimmy stewart though the movie is presented from his point of view with the action rotating around him mr stewart is more then up to the task of carrying the movie with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions just watch stewart when he is fired from his job because of a misunderstanding he is able to convey the shock anger fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes so perfectly in my estimation james stewart is without question the greatest film actor in the history of the medium there is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is able to so completely convey what he is feeling to an audience at the time he made this movie he still had most of his career ahead of him yet he is completely the master of his craft this is one of jimmy stewarts best movies and also one of the sweetest most enjoyable romantic comedies you will find i greatly recommend this movie especially for those that appreciate the work of stewart
1,i have just started watching the tv series what i like about you and i must say that is a joy to watch i always like to see new shows do well considering a lot of shows go off before you really get a feel for them i have watched amanda bynes since all that she is truly a funny girl what is the best about her comedy is that its so natural and what i mean about that is its something that a person could here there best friend saying its not rehearsedbr br i just recently started watching the show and have fell in love i am just watching reruns as of now but am looking forward to the next season all the characters in the show give something to the whole story line its nice to see some old face from other shows i enjoyed watching in the past such as jennie garth from 90210 leslie grossman from popular and wesley jonathan from city guys the new character are very talented as well nick zano has that charm the makes you love him even when he is doing something wrong to holly bynesbr br overall this show has the right ingredients to be successful i look forward to watching it grow

3,a nightmare on elm street the dream childbr br this is a bad movie theres no escaping it i love the series and i think freddy is probably the best character ever in horror movies but even being a fan i cant help but see this movie is mediocrebr br theres not even an effort to build an interesting story and strong characters by now they had just given up they dont even try they are the production of course hoping for a few more easy dollarsbr br the story doesnt grab your attention its so simple its almost absentbr br alice a survivor from part is now pregnant freddy is coming back through the babys dreams at the beginning we learn that to stop him alice must find his mother and thats it br br the story advances slowly since theres so little plot meaning it turns pretty boring after a few minutes of bad dialogues and awful acting in fact thats the only scary thing the acting since the deaths are not even slightly cool br br the characters are so uninteresting we couldnt care less for thembr br the girls are as unattractive as possible the whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theatre group ive seen better actors in school plays its embarrassing reallybr br lisa wilcox still manages to bring some class to this she is beautiful sexy and has some talent but the material just didnt let her shine what a pitybr br stephen hopkins work is nowhere close to renny harlins brilliant direction in dream master he tries some imaginative shots near the end but that tension harlin and craven created so well in the previous movies is no where to be foundbr br the dream child is just another unimaginative sequel its the kind of movie that give horror series a bad name br br the end for the once scary freddy its too sad to see him now a clown thats not funny a bad joke goodbye freddy
3,maybe its just because i have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff but this one got under my skin pardon the pun this piece is brave not afraid to go over the top and as satisfying as they come in terms of revenge movies not only did i find myself feeling lots of hatred for the screwer and lots of sympathy towards the screwee i felt myself cringe and feel pangs of disgust at certain junctures which is really a rare and delightful thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like myself some parts are very reminiscant of hellraiser but come off as tribute rather than imitation its a heavy handed piece that does not offer the viewer much to consider but i enjoy being assaulted by a film once and awhile this piece brings it and doesnt appologize i liked this one a lot do not watch whilst eating pudding
2,voodoo academy features an academy like no other one that houses only six male students in one bedroom these teenage guys are instructed in religion by a sinister young priest who enjoys tormenting and comforting them simultaneously the sole administrator of this academy is a young and seductive headmistress and she retains her handsome charges on a short leash so to speakbr br sexual overtones abound and the director obviously has high regard for young male bodies these young actors occasionally strip down to their designer underwear to sneak about the academy and their sexuality is the entire focus of the movie if youre not interested in the male form  stay awaybr br burdened by weak and awkward dialogue this lowbudget exploitation piece just stumbles along with a few laughable special effects tossed in between the yawns the mood is claustrophobic with tediously long takes a handful of cheap sets and few costume changes these visual elements come interspersed with seemingly unending sequences of banal dialogue intended as character and plot development it gives one the feeling it was filmed in three days
3,the godfather citizen kane star wars goodfellas none of the above compare to the complex brilliance of the sopranos each and every character has layers upon layers of absolute verity completely and utterly three dimensional we care about tony soprano wholeheartedly despite the fact that in the simplest model of good vs evil he is evil soprano is the most provocative intricate and fascinating protagonist ever created to this point in history if youre in the mood to be overtly challenged as a viewer and to be forever altered on your feelings toward entertainment watch the sopranos i defy anybody to sit down and watch the very first episode of season and not want to continue with the series each season is completely brilliant in its own way dvds are essential to anybodys collection  of out

0,the acting in the film is really well done honestly but the movie is so slow and so boring as soon as it gets interesting everything slows to a major halt i am glad to see sam rockwell in this he did a great job so did the other actors as i mentioned but man this is one of the worst dragged out films i have ever seen now maybe in a short film form this movie would be good but other than that avoid it this film has so much filler it makes a twinkie cake jealous br br i never ever walk out on films but watching this one at home with family i walked out yeah it was that boring apparently my comment doesnt have enough lines to post so heres some more filler i guess i was inspired by the movie i just watched
0,this is a very odd film  i wasnt really sure what is was about some n london lowlifes find a mute kid in the woods that they all believe is some kind of oracle and somehow makes them all in their own way change something about their lives that usually ends in disaster the film ended after about 90 minutes leaving me feeling quite unsatisfied almost annoyed at the pointlessness of it all i didnt care about any of the characters  none of them get a chance to endear themselves to the viewerbr br what was the message am i being dim it was just too odd what happens to runner why does emilio shoot the kid  that made absolutely no sense pointless can someone help me understand this mess of a film
2,seriously what the hell was this movie aboutsimply stupidid give it but1awful is the lowest you can goseriously this movie is not worth watchingwaste of time i dont know what the hell is wrong with you guys voting this movie out of 10i seriously can make a better movie than this  hire some other unemployed peoplen i promise ill make a movie better than thisthis movie was so badthat ill never watch a movie starring steve carrel againbottom line dont waste your time to download it off the net or rent itid nominate this movie for the worst movie of the century i mean the worst is something gotta give but after that this is the second
7,the 60s is an occasionally entertaining film most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film it is extremely uneven and includes many annoying elements take for instance the switch between black  white and color if done right this could of been fairly effective but because it was done poorly  it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience much of the film had an odd feel to it the acting wasnt extremely bad for a made for tv flick but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times many of the events were not coherent and ending up being confusing how did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960s the ending was much too sappy for my tastes because it was hollywoodized everything had to turn out right in the end i would advise you to not waste your time on the 60s and do something else with your time im glad i watched this in class and not on my own time i think i can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of bob dylans music those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick i hope you take my advice and stay away from this
1,pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain the majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving royalties this is a horrible film in every way imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slashercomedy video they would receive a d for this college kids would receive an f or asked to leave the school since this monstrosity was made by professionals i believe there should be jail time or at least cinema probation i enjoy watching bad movies like plan from outer space but this thing doesnt even fall into that category the script acting sound and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable if you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with ed wood blaxploitation or 1970s horror films after viewing this you get the feeling youve wasted an hour and a half of your life
5,cinderellabr br i hadnt watched this film for about five years the last time i saw it the magic remains there is something that definitely contains that storybook feel the songs entertain and the secondary characters all please the villains in the form of step sisters are perfectly evil and vile then there is the most magical of all disney the mice making the dress and well you know the rest to sum up the four of the disney princess movies are all great but this is a charming magical experience watch and enjoy oh and of course cinderella is wonderful as the main character in the moviebr br if you think about it disney movies can really lost their charm with elene wood and others the movie has such a feel to it you simply cant help but smilebr br they say the moral of this story is that dreams come true of course in the real world some are believers others are hopers in this film its even more the magical when her rainbow comes smiling br br and of course the rest iscinderella
2,a fun concept but poorly executed except for the fairly good makeup effects theres really not much to it there are obvious problems for example after taking what seems to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size the main character seems to go from normal size to deathly thin in days and once hes deathly thin he stays pretty much equally deathly thin for what seems to be a long timebr br in any case the movie has far worse problems than thatthe cinematography is decidedly lowbudgettvshow quality and most of all the acting is pretty awful all around robert john burke seems to always be trying for some kind of weird snarling charlton heston impersonation and is literally painful to watch the only scary thing is that lucinda jenney and kari wuhrer are both even worsebr br the only reason why im giving this movie as high as i am is that once the movie enters its last 13 or so and joe mantegnas character takes over the movie develops a fun campy cheesefest slaughterhouse feel and the gangsters crazy schemes for tormenting the totally obnoxious gypsies are somewhat fun to watch the ending if predictable is also nicely mean avoid unless youre a kingophile or are really psyched up at the idea of the voice of fat tony from the simpsons terrorizing a gypsy camp

6,its hard to put your finger on this one basically i suppose its a comedy about an idle rich drunk who falls in love with a comparatively poor girl whom he wants to marry at the risk of being disowned by his familybr br it has funny moments romantic moments and touching moments dudley moore is funny and somehow makes his selfcentred character endearing liza minelli is a convincing foil as the the feisty opposite he attracts but john gielgud steals the show as arthurs wonderfully sarcastic butlerbr br its corny but great fun with a memorable soundtrack and ran for nearly months at our local fleapit

7,i simply give this a three because it fulfilled what my buddies and i hoped it would do entertain br br i wasnt stupid enough to rent this thinking it would be a zombie film up there with the likes of romero or fulci but what i rented it for was a laugh br br if you are looking for a film for amusement or a film to make you shake your head in embarrassment go for it this is perfect for junior mystery science theater fans but the only downside is that it is so bad it makes fun of itself br br i personally think it is a shame to relate this to any other hollywood title that we may know because when a film sucks like this it has its own genre
2,seldom do we see such short comments written by imdb filmgoers perhaps its because this lightweight dark comedy entertains and pleases without depth or are we missing something id watch it again if i had some incentivebr br so whats a happenstance to the french it is le battement dailes du papillon serendipity fate perhaps its an event that is the culmination of a series of random happenings weve all had these its called life but when looked at in this way you begin to get the feeling that random might be more like fatedbr br a happenstance in this film might be an occurrence as minor as knocking a few leaves of lettuce off the back of a truck or as major as basing a major life decision on the accuracy of a stranger tossing of a pebble all these incidents cause other events that  well you get the picture dominoes multiply those by 30 characters and an average of each and you have to really stretch your imagination to accept the remote chance that this scenario could happen and i think that theres a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like this but then this is the magic world of cinemabr br we admit that it is fun to watch the way the writerdirector weaves together these unrelated events into a story which enmeshes the lives of these french citizens if you have a couple of hours and are looking for a whimsical escape heres the place to do it or if youre recovering from surgery and arent going anywhere anyway this will engage you while your stitches are healing br br happenstance will not go down as an award winner but it should develop a cult following stranger things have happenedbr br  soren kierkegaard is attributed with the following life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forward if you looked at the detail in many of your own life experiences meeting your first love finding the perfect gift your last auto accident you would find a series of seemingly random events leading up to itbr br thats the answer i forgot to bring along an existentialist to explain happenstance to me
1,because some people like me like to know everything about a movie even if they plan to see it including the ending anyway heres the ending as i remember it because i couldnt have been more than yrs old when i saw it for the first and only time on tv but ill tell ya it sure scared the little kid that i was and i thought about it for days afterward and it still stands out in my mind to this day even though some of the details are a little vague abe vigoda was in this movie i dont remember that i didnt even remember that ol barnabus was in this movie and i loved dark shadows so at the end the lead character belinda montgomery is lured by the judge joseph cotton im guessing even though i remember it as him being an old family physician or something instead of a judge see how memory fades to the wedding place which as i remember it is in a cavern of some kind maybe ive got that wrong and shelley winters is there laughing and the judge has a cape on and the camera angle is kind of looking up at him and he throws back the cloak and he has goat legs and he announces hes actually her father the devil and shes played right into their the satanic cults hands because the mortal guy she has fallen in love with i guess thats robert foxworth turns out also to be the guy satan wants to marry her off to the demon with yellow eyes and yep sure enough they show robert foxworth and his eyes glow yellow there are a lot of closeups in the last few minutes of the film everyone is laughing and rejoicing except for belinda montgomery who is very unhappy and cries or screams or something and thats the end the bad guys win
5,dull flatlydirected comedy has zero laughs and wastes a great cast alan alda wore too many hats on this one and it shows newcomer anthony lapaglia provides the only spark of life in this tedium but its not enoughbr br one of those scripts that if you were a neophyte and submitted it to an agent or producer would be ripped to shreds and rejected without discussion
0,absolutely putrid slasher film has not one redeeming quality it has camp councellor angelapamela andersonawful as the killerher quips when she wastes people arent even amusingon the warpath slaying teenagers who act the least bit naughty or resist her pleadings for good behavior we run the gamut of boring clichd killings such as the slashing to the throat to one kid looking for his freddy clawed glove a kid who gets a chainsaw one girl who gets drilled one who gets shoved into the crapperfilled with leeches one who is roasted etcbr br it doesnt have one original idea to offer and is merely a waste of time that is unless you want to see valerie hartmenswho plays the slut allytits most of the violence occurs offscreen so even that will not satisfy
6,wow finally jim carrey has returned from the died this movie had me laughing and crying it also sends a message that we should all know and learn from jeniffer aniston was great she will finally have a hit movie under her belt if you liked liar liar you will love this movie i give it 910
0,i went to see ashura as 2005 fantasia festival kickoff man that was one cool kick off the director was supposed to be in montreal for the canadian premiere but due to health reasons hes still in japanoh lord i hope he gets better and makes plenty of other moviesbr br the plot is pretty simple but somewhat originalthe demons are roaming in edo in japan and swordsmans called demon wardens are slaying them and fearing the rebirth of ashura the demon goddess whos sleeping and supposedly is very kickassbr br it brings us to izumosome kind of elite swordsman called demon slayer and his buddy jaku whos the typical violent jealous assholebr br seems boring well now it thickensbr br izumo took his retirement from killing demons since he slayed a young kid on the impression that he was the demon he never knew but he did killed her so izumo went on with his life and recycled himself in kabuki theater in a boat joyride on a nice night izumo spots a girl hiding on a bridge and it changes his life and restart to slay demonsfor the good cause the cause of loveand damnthe guy knows how to handle a sword and to pull an entertaining massacrebr br izumo carries the movie as far as playing goeshe is the total packagehe knows how to fighthell yeah he knows hes witty hes intelligent and he has that grit you never have to yell no izumo its a trap the guy already knows it he has that common sense hes really the perfect herobr br as far as cinematography goes the esthetics are pretty interesting its by far the movie that looks the most like a manga its creamed full of special effects and nothing at all cost will prevent this movie to look realisticits pretty amazing lots of colours an unreal photography other than thatits pretty straightforwardbut like i said the main character is carrying the movie a must see a tale lead by masterful hands
7,repetitive music annoying narration terrible cinematography effects half of the plot seemed centered around shock value and the other half seemed to be focused on appeasing the type of crowd that would nag at people to start a fightbr br one of the best scenes was in the deleted scenes section the one where shes in the principles office with her mom i dont understand why theyd cut that the movie seemed desperate to make a point about anything it could and domino talking about sororities would have been a highlight of the moviebr br ridiculous camera work is reminiscent of mtv and completely not needed or helpful to a movie speeding the film up just to jump past a lot of things and rotating the camera around something repeatedly got old the first time it was used its like the directors are wanting to use up all this extra footage they didnt want to throw awaybr br another movie with jerry springer in it that shouldve told me not to watch it from the previewbr br a popular movie for the in crowd
6,ok its not the best film ive ever seen but at the same time ive been able to sit and watch it twice story line was pretty awful and during the first part of the first short story i wondered what the hell i was watching but at the same time it was so awful i loved it cheap laughs all the waybr br and jebidia deserves an oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that let him down was half way through he stopped his silly name callingbr br overall the film was pretty perfetic but if your after cheap laughs and you see it in pound land go by it
0,having seen the short a number of times at horror movie marathons i believe it to be a humorous parody that slices to the main point of its referencebr br though the themes are crusty and stale to todays viewers it is by no means a crumby waste of timebr br though being a student film gives little rise to an excuse the proof is that it appears crafted with care on a budget of little to no doughbr br as noted by another reviewer it is less than ten minutes which is plenty of time to cleanse the viewing palate with a toast of joy sit back and loaf idly through the filmbr br i think this shortbread of a film should be enjoyed as an appetizer for the title reference and the viewer should relax and roll with it
2,cccc is the first good film in bollywood of 2001 when i first saw the trailer of the film i thought it would be a nice family movie i was right salman khan has given is strongest performance ever my family werent too keen on him but after seeing this film my family are very impressed with him rani and preity are wonderful the film is going to be a huge hit because of the three main stars br br its about raj salman khan and priya meeting and falling in love they get married and go to switzerland for their honeymoon when they come back raj and priya find out that priya is pregnant rajs family are full of joy when they find out especially rajs dada amrish puri raj and his family are playing cricket one day and priya has an accident which causes priya to have a miscarriage raj has a very close family friend who is a doctor balraj chopra prem chopra he tells raj and priya that she can no longer have anymore kids raj and priya keep this quiet from the family raj and priya decide to go for surrogacy surrogacy to them is that they will find a girl and raj and that girl will have a baby together and then hand the baby over to raj and priya raj finds a girl her name is madhubala preity zinta she is a dancer and a prostitute raj tells her the situation and bribes her with money and she agrees raj changes madhubala completley raj tells priya that he has found a girl madhubala and priya meet and become friends they go to switzerland to do this so no one finds out priya spends the night in a church and raj and madhubala are all alone and they spend the night together the doctor confirms that madhubala is pregnant and they are all happy raj tells his family that priya is pregnant they are happy again madhubala comes to love raj and she wants him what happens next watch cccc to find out br br the one thing i didnt like about the film is their idea of surrogacy they should have done it the proper way in the film but it didnt ruin the film it was still excellentbr br the songs of the film are great my favourites are chori chori chupke chupke dekhne walon ne deewana hai yeh mann and mehndi the song mehndi is very colourful in that song it shows the ghod bharai taking place and it is very colourful the film deserves 1010
5,this is a lot of silliness about a woman from london who marries a tea planter from ceylon whom she barely knows its full of cliches and the liz taylor character is not believable it has a marvelous set some exotic location footage it shows taylor at the height of her beauty she looks stunning
5,many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with the mortal storm or casablanca everyone is entitled to compare films they choose but the similarities of the mortal storm and watch on the rhine are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the nazi juggernaut while the main comparative point brought out with casablanca is the seeming unjust treatment of humphrey bogart in 1943 by the academy of motion picture arts and science because they chose paul lukas instead for the best actor oscar it does not strike me as totally wrong lukas had a good career in film both here and in england  he is the villain in the lady vanishes and this performance was his best one bogart had more great performances in him than rick blaine for instance he was ignored for sam spade in the maltese falcon and roy earle in high sierra two years earlier both of which were first rate performances and he would not get an oscar for his greatest performances as fred c dobbs in the treasure of sierra madres the writermurder suspect in in a lonely place and captain philip francis queeg in the caine mutiny afterward  he got it for charley in the african queen i think that bogie should have got it for the role of dobbs but it did not happen but lukas was lucky  he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career few can claim thatbr br to me the film to look at with watch on the rhine is based on another playscript by hellman the searching wind they both look at americas spirit of isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s the searching wind is really looking at the whole interwar period while watch on the rhine set in the years just proceeding our entry into world war ii deals with a few weeks of time therefore it is better constructed as a play and more meaningful for its impact br br the film has many good performances led by lukas as the exhausted but determined antinazi fightercourier davis as his loyal wife wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to lukas being the center of the plays activities coulouris as the selfish conniving but ultimately foolish and ineffective teck lucille watson as the mother of davis and geraldine fitzgerald as coulouris wiser and sadder and fed up wife and kurt katch who delivers a devastating critique as the local embassys gestapo chief about coulouris and others who would deal with the nazis it has dialog with bite in it and what it says is quite true it also has moments of near poetry witness the scene towards the end when coulouris is left alone with lukas and davis and says the new world has left the scene to the old world hellman could write very well at timesbr br given the strength of the film script and performances i would rate this film highly among world war ii films
3,i only gave this ridiculously titled comedy horror flick a because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it a group of tourists supposedly on vacation in ireland but actually in canada run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other and the plot is more or less right out of the hill have eyes ands wrong turn only problem is unless i miscounted theres only one mutant on display and he isnt all that impressive sort of like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago some gory but silly deaths help but the film is strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief the ending is predictable and has been done to death no pun intended
6,i got a good laugh reading all the idiotic comments for this filmbr br as its obvious that those people who criticized the movie never seen it or were stupid enough to pay to see itbr br the best reason to watch was on the elvira show a few years back elvira delivered the movie with as many laughs as one canbr br its an ok monster flick compared to the hundreds of horrendous american flicks made way better
7,this is the second part of the animatrix a collection of animated short movies that tell us a little more about the world of the matrixbr br in this one we learn how men and machines could not work and live together it is a little history lesson in the world of the matrix not as good as the first part the final flight of the osiris but still pretty entertaining
0,when i say  doctor who  you might conjure up an image of tom baker  or jon pertwee or maybe peter davison  when i say  james bond  youll almost certainly conjure up an image of sean connery while a small handful of people may think of roger moore or pierce brosnan  but when i say  sgt bilko  absolutely everyone will think of phil silvers  unlike doctor who or james bond the role belongs exclusively to one actor  and thats the problem with this film version youll continually wish you were watching the old black and white show  in fact the whole idea of making a film version of bilko without silvers in the title role comes close to sacrilage
6,kim basinger stars as della a desperate housewife with a somewhat abusive husband who gets into trouble while shes out at the local mall doing some last minute christmas shopping after placing a hastily scrawled hateful note on a piece of paper and sticking said paper in the windshield of a car that took up two parking spaces she finds out the owners of the car are the rainbow coilition of villains comprising of a white guy a mexican a chinese guy  a black they confront her about the note cap a helpless security guard and the chase is on during the course of the film della will go for hunted to hunter as she unleashes her inner bronsonbr br i found this to be a somewhat tense little thriller the acting was good enough except for a few scenes the why god why bit was cringe worthy in its badness though it comes undone a bit due to the sheer fact that the villains della chases fromafter are mindnumbingly stupid if they hadnt had the intellect of any given home alone baddie perhaps their eventual defeat would be something to savor instead of the meh reaction it evokes the unbelievability factor im willing to overlook as both the director  one of the producers had part in bringing shoot em up to the screen a film which while throwing credibility out the window was immensely fun this film while never attaining the heights of that film was good in its own rightsbr br my grade c br br anchor bay dvd extras commentary with writerdirector susan montford and producer don murphy a 25 and a half minute makingof a trailer  two tv spots for this film and trailer for lower learning
5,it would help to know why it took so long for a book as movieready as the house next door to be adapted for film or television the book was copyrighted in 1978 one reason could be problems designing the house the house in this lifetime film is really so ugly that i cant imagine anyone buying it in fact its so ugly that someone would probably have come and destroyed it as soon as it was builtbr br im not crazy about horror genre books but this one was hard to put down when i came across it around ten years ago the main characters are not the kind of people to look for anything occult in life and this is one of the books strengths they are not people who would conclude that the architect was some type of demonor the devil personified without witnessing and analyzing the events described so well in the book however it is a downbeat book for the most part and i dont think that appeals to the people who run lifetime maybe someone will come up with another version of the book in years to come a better housebetter musica better screenplay and darker lightingwould certainly help
4,encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film bad mistake ive seen 950 films and this is truly one of the worst of them  its awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack the films only song  a lame country tune  is played no less than four times the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film br br the only thing that prevents me giving this a 1score is harvey keitel  while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort one for keitel obsessives only
5,first off i really enjoyed zombi by lucio fulci this film was utter trash i couldnt stand to watch it the storyline was a joke the acting was a joke and the fact that zombi has nothing to do with zombi is even more a jokebr br we jump from voodoo to death the harmful agent brining people back to life whatever this movie isnt worth the 100 it cost to rent it i really enjoyed lucio fulci movies but this one was horrible if zombi is an indicator for how zombi and are going to be i think i will just skip thembr br zombi is an awesome flique tho
2,great entertainment from start to the end wonderful performances by belushi beach dalton  railsback some twists and many action scenes the movie was made for me funny lines in the screenplay good music dalton as the tough sheriff and railsback as redneckvillain i must recommend this film to every actionadventure fan 1010
1,as an altman fan id sought out this movie for years thinking that with such a great cast it would have to be at least marginally brilliantbr br big mistakebr br this is one of altmans bigcast mishmashes thrown together haphazardly and improvisationally or so it feels with the hope that it would all come together in the editing room it doesntbr br as maltin points out this turkey is notable only for the debut performance of alfre woodard who outshines the vets all around her but other than that avoid at all costs which is pretty easy to do  its never been released on video  to my knowledge  and its cable appearances have the frequency of halleys comet
0,i work as a hotel concierge in washington dc and take my word there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by michael j fox  we simply do not walk around with our pockets bursting with theater tickets and 100 bills if i ever let anybody use a room for some afternoon delight time id be fired on the spot the organization to which i belong les clefs dor has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously similarly untrue was the concept at the end of the movie of doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them there is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organizationbr br this film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary in short it does a disservice to our organization i welcome any comments
4,i do regret that i have bought this series i expected more action more objective picture and more consistency this is just a pure propaganda series very dark without any charm or romanticism it is just boredom itself i find the actors work quite weak as well odonnell might seem charming as robin with batman but in this picture he lacks any charm probably while he becomes older he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up it comes as no surprise that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the uk for 40 of the recommended price and was not even released in the netherlands
6,i remember seeing this film years ago on i think bbc2 i would very much like to view it again  does anyone know how i can obtain a copy as i remember it was an especially powerful movie in particular the scene that stands out is of the horses wearing gas masks apart from that i really cant recall too much about the story  which is why i want to view it again i have trawled the web but am unable to find a copy which is unusual in my experience  perhaps there is no dvd or vhs of this film on the market would appreciate any help anyone can give me on this thanks very much in advance for your assistance best regards albany234googlemailcom
6,hello can anybody hear me i dont know why you came to this page but if youre a fellow viewer of this movie join the fanclub this movie was so unbelievably bad i couldnt stop laughing when i saw it i think its a must see its bad in a nice way every cliche ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here im afraid its very hard to get a copy of this movie but it should be in the top 10 of worst movies ever made
5,spoilers this is a gripping movie about grifters but who is conning who here when does the hunter turn into the prey this gritty dark movie is slow moving and seductive it pulls you in and drags you down the proverbial garden path only to waylay you just as you think you are safebr br it has a riveting script with good acting at least from the leads i didnt notice the background music but it was never jarring so it must have been done rightbr br i was very surprised that i liked this movie because i dont usually go for this genre but this one sucked me in and kept he hooked until the end
2,keenan ivory wayans is probably one of the worst directors i swear he has no real knowledge on how to make films he has made one brilliant film and that is scary movie scary movie was ok too but everything else keenan has made are real disasters avoid such titles like dont be a menace to south central while drinking your juice in the hood i know what a title  obviously this film too just anything that has keenans name in the creditsbr br it was an hour and a half on stupid nonsense that never made me laugh just trust me on this maybe women might like this film a little because of some of things that happen but on a whole this film will never be liked by anyone with a good taste in films 110jd seaton
0,the sexploitation movie era of the late sixties and early seventies began with the allowance of gratuitous nudity in mainstream films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn its peak years were between 1968 and 1972 one of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was monica gayle who had a small but fanatic cult of followers she was actually able to act unlike many who filled the lead roles of these flicks and her subsequent credits proved it and her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career was taking off only heightens her mystiquebr br gary graver the director was also a talent probably too talented for the sexploitation genre and his skill combined with monica gayles screen presence makes sandra the making of a woman a pleasantly enjoyable experience the film never drags and you wont have your finger pressed on the fastforward button
5,chinese ghost story iii is a totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantasy films the film delivers the spellcasting special effects that one can expect but fails painfully on all other fronts the actors all play extremely silly caricatures you have to be still in diapers to find their slapstick humor even remotely funny the plot is predictable and the development is sometimes erratic and often slow towards the end the movie begins to resemble old godzilla films including shabby largerthanlife special effects and a well yet another ghost with a godzilla head maybe i would have grinned if i was expecting campbr br it is astonishing to see what trash fantasy fans have to put up with  in this case because somebody thought they could squeeze a little extra money out of a successful formula they wont be able to do it again the cash cow is now dead as a dodo
3,a message movie but a rather good one outstanding cast top to bottom interesting in that bette daviss plot line is essentially back story the extremely negative reviews name throwing at the screenplayplaywright associating this somehow with extremely negative comments about angles in america etc etc object to the movie being too preachy about germany in wwii gosh that is just a bit too sophisticated an understanding of morality for mebr br theatrical and moviemaking and acting styles vary over time and of course 70 years later this particular movie would not be made in this way yes casablanca is a better movie i guess but although made in the same year and both having nazis in them casablanca is primarily a love story the love story in this movie takes second seat to the spy plotmore of a thriller both have a rather large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character actors the children are a bit tedious and could have been edited
0,and gi joe go stuck in the water i die of laufther every time i see this movie and then a big brown shark came this is comedy at its best this blows away the kings of comedy and anyone else andrew dice clay jerry tucker rock they cant thouch the man the myth the legend eddie murphybr br yo eddie we want morebr br more more more more more more 
0,the first half hour of the movie had a steady pace and introduced the characters however all of a sudden everything was happening too quick a lame reason for akshey kumar to date girls very loud over acting by both akshey and john abraham neha dupia was the highlight of the movie paresh rawal did well but not as good as his performance in hera pheri overall this movie was the biggest disappointment the film does no justice to its trailer save your money and dont watch this movie watch hera pheri and hungama againbr br summarising it a cheap stage show performance and appearance to the film no story or substance the plot was extraordinarily nonsense good music by preetam the man who bought us dhoom keep it up movie shot all in one room new comers female cast were okay as it was their first film but established actors like akshey and john totally disappointed an established director like priyadarshan gives his worst movie ever
4,foxs epic telling of one a americas greatest pioneering efforts comes to dvd with some truly outstanding extras brigham young the frontiersman was added for the european release telling the story the great pioneer leader who under inspiration brought members of the mormon faith church of jesus christ of latterday saintsout to the salt lake valley in 1847 after mobs murdered their prophetleader joseph smith played by vincent price was brought to the screen in 1940 just as america was about to enter world war ii it was a daring move on fox chief darryl f zanuck and it was a breath of fresh air to the mormon people as this was the first film attempt to favorably show their faith on the screen now fox working with james darc curator of the excellent motion picture archives at brigham young university in provo utah has brought this film to the dvd format in an outstading edition mr darc who some years ago did his doctoral dissertation on the film has provided one of the most in depth commentary tracks ever done for a dvd he seperates the fact from the fiction and lets listeners understand why this films was so much appreciated by church leaders even though embellishments to the truth run throughout the film one of the fun bits of information deals with dean jagger the actor who plays the title role many years after the film he married a lattersaint woman and was eventually converted to the lds faith there is much to be learned from darcs knowledge and it is great to have this as part of the dvd there are over 100 pictures from the fox  byu archives included on the disc plus newsreel footage of the incredible premiere at seven theatres in salt lake city thanks fox for another outstanding dvd  and thank you james darc for your great commentary
6,this must have been one of the worst movies i have ever seenbr br i have to disagree with another commenter who said the special effects were okay i found them pretty bad it just wasnt realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual storybr br maybe that distraction is the reason that i did not fully understand the story the archaeologists are looking for the set they do not bother to tell what set or what is so special about it that also makes it unclear why they search for it in california while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient egyptbr br if youre shooting a movie that takes place in the desert take the effort to actually go to the desert the beginning  the ancient ceremony  looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desertbr br the actionlevel was constant throughout the movie no ups and downs no climax it made the movie look short and thats certainly a pro for this particular movie
4,its a waist to indulge such great actors in such a weak and boring movie besides all the unanswered questions posted in the other comments whats so difficult about capturing the robbers just eliminate the bank workers see who was at the bankfrom all the cameras footage anglesprior to the robbers entry and you have those extra remaining robbers among the hostages where is the suspense every body is talking about it was so obvious the moment the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that they were all going to walk out the front door seen it many times at least mr spike lee could have seasoned the movie with some good music score and artistic shooting the movie is not worth it pronto
4,having heard of modesty blaise before but never having read a novel or a comic strip my wife and i liked the film a lot it delivered in a captivating way a good introduction to the character and her backgroundbr br although it has some action flick elements it is much more an intimate play excellently written sadly this is also where a major drawback of the movie is revealed an intimate play lives on the capabilities of its actors and unfortunately only half of the cast delivered while alexandra staden did an excellent job as modesty blaise her counterpart nikolaj coasterwaldau  as the villain miklos  did not smiling his way through the plot as if it is an extend toothpaste commercial he fails to build up an atmosphere of anxiety that would have made the movie a masterpiece the supporting cast is somehow similar from some stereotyped gangsters and sluts to decent performances from fred pearson as professor lob and eugenia yuan as irina
4,i moved out here to get away from this kind of thing the small town sheriff lamentsbr br this happens a lot in chicago his deputy asksbr br well no not really the plot is that a group of martians mistake a halloween rebroadcast of orson welles war of the worlds as an account of a real martian invasion and conclude they need to get in on the action what follows are a bunch of mishaps involving the martians haphazard attempts to conquer the town of big bean il everyone concludes they are kids in really good costumes except for the sheriffs daughter and her friend a kid in a duck suitbr br the martians themselves are comical and you get the impression they are no threat to anyone but themselves pretty early on its a fun family movie
0,strange yet emotionally disturbing chiller about fed up middleaged man william h macy who finally decides to leave the family business murder for hire run by his quietly overdemanding father donald sutherland while seeing a shrink john ritter and flirting with another patient neve campbellbr br talk about a major dilemma but panic is a topnotch thriller that looks like american beauty meets the professional macy and sutherland are the standouts here remarkable debut for firsttime writerdirector henry bromell im surprised that this movie didnt get a chance to stay in theaters for more than a couple of weeks
6,syriana swept the critics upon release and everything seemed to be raving about it i suppose its one of those films that is intensely intelligentso intelligent that i think you need to be well versed in the oil industry and a politically brilliant mind i dont consider myself unintelligent ive been studying politics since my early teens and i enjoy an intelligent film but for the most part unless its a documentary films are meant to be primarily entertaining as well as have a message syriana tried to be strictly intelligent and it does turn some people away i would even go so far as to say that those who rave about it and insist its a 1010 are lying because they think they look better this film was the most confusing senseless mindless dribble i have seen in awhileespecially considering the critical acclaim the oscar nods and the cast screenplay writer stephen gaghan has disappointed me yet again his horribly written havoc preceded this film and i think hes just trying way too hard i cant believe he was offered the opportunity to write the da vinci code screenplay on top of that gaghan directed the film which made it an absolute mess i had no idea who anyone was why things were happening who was who and what was what it was a disasterbr br because i dont really know who anyone was i can only mention the actors and what i thought of their performances because despite the horrendously complicated script the actors did alright george clooney plays cia field agent and assassin i think bob barnes clooney has never been a favorite of mine but lately hes managed to churn out some decent performances and this seemed to be a pretty good performance on his part barnes was a complex character with a sordid history and if i knew what was going on with him i would have really enjoyed his character matt damon plays bryan woodman and he is rather bland and always looks like a deer in the headlights which i can understand his confusion after reading this script and then trying to perform it amanda peet plays his wife and she does well in the few scenes she is given christopher plummer makes a cameo appearance as someone doing something i like plummer and love seeing him show up even if he doesnt get top billing anymorebr br the cast is intense if only the story made sense id like to exact quote the description of plot on imdb a missile disappears in iran but the cia has other problems the heir to an emirate gives an oil contract to china cutting out a us company that promptly fires its immigrant workers and merges with a small firm that has landed a kazakhstani oil contract the department of justice suspects bribery and the oil companys law firm finds a scapegoat the cia also needs one when its plot to kill the emirapparent fails agent bob barnes the fall guy sorts out the double cross an american economist parlays the death of his son into a contract to advise the sheik the cia wants dead the jobless pakistanis join a fundamentalist group all roads start and end in the oil fields what say who now syriana might be the thinking mans movie but it bored me to tears and no matter how hard i tried to stay with it i eventually surrendered and turned it off after an hour and a half and you couldnt have bribed me enough to get me to finish it i suppose if you want to form an opinion than by all means watch it but i promise you someone looking for entertainment or an enjoyable film will be asleep in the first half hour 110
0,br br film dominated by ravenhaired barbara steele it was seen when i was seven or eight and created permanent images of pallid vampiric men and women stalking a castle seeking blood steele is an icon of horror films and an otherworldly beauty and the views of the walking dead predate romeros night of the living dead shamblers unifying them in my mindbr br i dont see the connection between this film and the haunting which is clever but ambiguous about the forces present la danza macabre is a bmovie without pretention daring you to fall in love with barbara steele and suffer the consequences theres no such draw to hauntings overwrought claire bloom the comparisons to the haunting are superficialbr br and no this movie does not need to be remade not only is it a product of the sixties but the large percentage of talentless cretins in hollywood cannot fathom macabres formula for terror that formula is based on one overriding factor good writing lowgrade classics like castle and cormans poe films with r matheson and tourneurs out of the past share a commonality of strong writing its simple get a real writer like richard matheson or steve mcquarrie and let them put a plot into todays cinematic mess besides that let hollywood attempt some original material for a change and stop exploiting the obviously superior product of the past
